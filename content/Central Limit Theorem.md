# What is it?

The *Central Limit Theorem* is a important **[[Limits|limit]] theorem** in [[Statistics]] and [[Probability]], which creates the base for **assuming characteristics from a sample to the entire population**, along with the [[Law of Large Numbers]].

The idea is that the **sum of a large number of averages is approximately normal**, given some assumptions. So for an unknown variable, one could use the *central limit theorem* to analyze it as a [[Normal Distribution]], which opens up various different methods to apply, like [[ANOVA]].
