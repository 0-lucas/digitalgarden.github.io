# What is it?

*Big-O notation* is the most common way of comparing the [[Algorithm Complexity]] between different [[Algorithms]]. It refers to the mathematical function that describes the *order of magnitude* of the **functions executed on each data point $n$**.

When using *Big-O*, is also known as the **worst case scenario** of an [[Algorithms|algorithm]], which can be affected by how the data is presented â€” if it's sorted, distinct, etc.

# Understanding Big-O

To write a *Big-O notation* of any mathematical function describing an [[Algorithms|algorithm]], one would just **consider the element of highest order**. This is because one uses only the *order of magnitude* of the function to write *Big-O*.
