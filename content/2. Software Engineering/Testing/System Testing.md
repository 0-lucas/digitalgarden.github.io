# What is it?

In [[Software Testing]], *system testing* is made only after [[Integration Testing]]. The objective is to **validate** **that the** **system can execute** processes that follow the **user routine** and **use-cases**, and still return **expected results**.

Normally, a real scenario is brought from the user, with its **inputs**, **processes**, **possible outputs**, and **workflows**. This scenario is then simulated using the *system test* as an **algorithm that mimics the user's actions**.
