# What is it?

A *queue* is very similar to [[Stacks]]. They are *abstract [[Data Structures|data structures]]*, meaning while they are not **structures themselves**, they are ways of managing other linear [[Data Structures|data structures]], like [[Arrays]] and [[Linked Lists]].

To characterize a *queue* structure, one **must only retrieve the last elements**, and only **insert at the beginning of the queue**.

>[!tip] The FIFO principle
> *Queues* work with the *FIFO* principle, which stands for *First in, First Out*. Much like a *queue* in real life, the **first elements to arrive, are retrieved first**, and all others must wait for their turn.
