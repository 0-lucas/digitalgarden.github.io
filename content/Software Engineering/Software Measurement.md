# Functional Point Analysis

*FPA*, which stands for *functional point analysis*, is a method which **measures the functional size** and **complexity** of the software from the **perspective of the user**, based on the requests and responses that the user receives.

>[!caution]  **What it does, not how it's built.**
> *FPA* measures the complexity of **what the software does**, not the complexity or effort needed to **build the software**. Because of that, it's not used for projects which are on the initial stages of development.
