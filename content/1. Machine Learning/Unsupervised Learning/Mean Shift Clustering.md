# What is it?

*Mean Shift* is a *centroid-based* [[Clustering]] [[Algorithms||algorithm]] which can apply [[Statistical Distribution|statistical distributions]] and other [[Kernel]] functions to **group together data points closer** to  *centroids*. 

Depending on the *[[Kernel]] function* used, *Mean Shift* can **handle very complex and non-linear data**, which would be impossible to handle in other [[Clustering|clustering]] methods, like [[K-Means]].
