# What is it?

In [[Linear Algebra]], it's possible to **classify different sets of [[Vectors]]** inside of a [[Vector Spaces|vector space]] as *linearly dependent* or *linearly independent*.

# Linearly dependent vectors

A set of [[Vectors|vectors]] $\{\mathbf{v}_{1}, \mathbf{v}_{2},\dots \mathbf{v}_{n}\}$ belonging to a [[Vector Spaces|vector space]] $\mathbf{V}$ is **said to be *linearly dependent*** if:
$$
c_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1} + c_{2}\mathbf{v}_{2} + \dots + c_{n}\mathbf{v}_{n} = 0
$$
