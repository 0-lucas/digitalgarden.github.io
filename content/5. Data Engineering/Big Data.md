# What is it?

*Big Data* refers to **extremely large datasets** and **innovative technologies** used to efficiently **store**, **handle**, and **analyze** these datasets. The popularization of the internet, social media, and [[Internet of Things]] devices, along with **rapid  development** of new **hardware technology**, **accelerated the creation of data** of the most different contexts.

# The 5 Vs 

*Big Data* is **not dictated only by the volume** of a dataset. The [[Data Engineering]] methods used to **work with the data** can also help to identify *Big Data*.
However, the **main characteristics** of *Big Data* could be summed in the *5 Vs*:

![[5vs 1.png]]


- ##### Volume
	**Not only related** to the **actual size of data**, but also to the **cost**, **complexity**, and **infrastructure needed** to handle it.

- ##### Velocity
	The ***latency*** of the system to **receive**, **process**, **store** and **return** data.

- ##### Variety
	A *big data* solution needs to be able to **handle** all [[Types of Data|types of data]], maintaining the **integrity of the data**.

- ##### Value
	Data which can be more **business-valuable** needs to be **prioritized** and **easier to access**.

- ##### Veracity
	Data needs to be **validated** and its **quality** needs to be tested and maintained. Inaccurate data **should not be** in the system.
