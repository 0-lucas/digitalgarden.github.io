# What is it?
*CSS* stands for *Cascading Styling Sheets*, and in [[Web Development]], it's used with [[HTML]] to **create the design and visual style of web pages**. While [[HTML]] defines the bare bones structure, *CSS* adds all **visual cues**, **layout**, and **animations**.

>[!tip] Creating *CSS* files
>We can work with *CSS* **inside** [[HTML]] files, defining the structure along with the style, or **create an [[External Stylesheets]]** to use as **reference** in a *.html* file.
>
>To **create an standalone *CSS* file**, create a **text file** ending with the ***.css* extension**.

# Adding CSS to a web page

There are three different ways of adding [[Stylesheets]] using *CSS*:

- #### External Stylesheets
	[[External Stylesheets]] are by far the best way to manage *CSS* in a web page, which can **avoid a lot of refactoring** when using it **with multiple web pages** and a lot of styling **between different elements**.

- #### Internal Styles
	[[Internal Stylesheets]] are used to define the styling within the [[HTML]] document and **will only work with its own document**.

- #### Inline Styles
	*Inline styling* is bound to a **unique *element***, the one which defines the styling. The `<style>` [[Tags|tag]] must be inside the *element*.
