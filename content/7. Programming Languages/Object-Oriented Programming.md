# What is it?

*OOP*, which stands for **object-oriented programming**, is a **programming paradigm** designed around [[Data Structures|data structures]] instead of *functions* and *logic*.
The object are **data fields which can have its own properties**, attributes and methods, **characterizing unique behaviors for each object**.

Some languages like [[C-Sharp]] and [[Java]] use the *object-oriented paradigm* as **the only way to write code**, while other languages like [[Python]], while still use *objects* as the **basis of the entire language**, also supports *procedural programming* .

# The principles of OOP

*OOP* has three basic principles: *encapsulation*, *inheritance*, and *polymorphism*. Some authors refer to *abstraction* as the fourth principle, which refers to the **abstracting the heavy logic into base objects**.

- ### Encapsulation
This is the mechanism of ***restricting access to data and parts of the code***. Each object should **control its own data**, **methods**, and **properties**. Think about what <u>really</u> needs to be exposed and what **should be kept private**.

- ### Inheritance
This is the mechanism in which ***one object reuses the functionality, properties, and methods of another object***. This brings **reusability** to the table, so instead of creating another very similar object, create a base, and from **that inherit all the children objects**.

- ### Polymorphism
***Polymorphism*** means <i><u>"the condition of occurring in several different forms"</u></i>. Types in the **same inheritance chain** should be able to **perform different tasks**, while children objects **share functionality,** but are also able to **define its own implementations**.
