- ##### Process step
	Identify process as per flow chart. Should be a single process, with scope only to said process.


- ##### Process function and requirement
	List the function and the requirements of the process step. Use a verb + subject + requirement form. E.g. APPLY the SOLDER PASTE in right volume 100% +/- 5%.


- ##### Potential failure mode
	Deny the function of the process. Should be generic. i.e DOES NOT apply solder paste. In some cases, a high number of failures may indicate that the requirements is not concise with the process itself.


- ##### Potential effects
	The symptom. The perceptible consequence of the failure by the consumer, be it external or internal.


- ##### Severity
	Severity rank given by a standard table - AIAG, for example. Normally ranges from 1 to 10.


- ##### Class
	Related to CTQ. Anything that affects safety, requirements, performance, other processes, or any external factors.


- ##### Potential cause of failures
	Describe any indication of how the process can allow the occurent of a failure mode, given something that can be fixed or controlled. Contrary to failure modes, this should the most specific possible for each failure mode. A cause of failure can occur in multiple failure modes.


- ##### Current prevention controls
	Tasks reduce the probability of a failure mode to occur. e.g. Benchmarking


- ##### Occurence
	It's the likelihood of a failure mode to occur. Standard rank given by a table.


- ##### Current detection methods
	Task which test the process to identify possible failures before the process deliver its result.


- ##### Detection
	Rank given by detection control from a standard table.


- ##### RPN
	Stands for Risk Priority Number, product of Severity x Occurence x Detection, ranging from 1 to 1000. **RPN is not recommmended to determine the need of action.**


- ##### Recommended Actions
	Generally, preventive actions are preferred over the detection. Actions intended to improve the project, product or process.


- ##### Action Results
	Describe actions takes, their results, implementation and date. After these are implemented, register new scores for RPN. If the new RPN is not lower than before, the actions were not significant.
