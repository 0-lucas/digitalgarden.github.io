# What is it?

*Routing*, in [[ASP.NET]], is the **process of directing HTTP requests** to endpoints, using the [[Middleware Pipeline]] to **process and decide** the endpoint.

Typically, all configuration of *routing* is made inside the [[Middleware Pipeline]], with the `.UseRouting()` method for **default matching**.
