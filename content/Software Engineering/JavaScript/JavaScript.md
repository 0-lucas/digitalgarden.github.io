# What is it?

*JavaScript* is a **high-level**, **interpreted** or *just-in-time* **compiled**, **dynamic** general programming language mainly used to build websites. It's the only language other than *Web Assembly* to run natively on all browsers.

It can natively be called from a [[HTML]] file or **declared inside of it**, to **create dynamic web pages**.

It's also possible to build **server-side applications** with [[Node.js]], **mobile apps and sites** with the *React framework* and **cross-platform hybrid desktop applications** with [[Electron]].
