# What is it?

In [[Software Testing]], *acceptance testing* is **done only after** [[System Testing]] and **all modules** from the system passes through the tests.

It's objective is to validate, **with the user**, that the developed solution **satisfy their needs**. Normally, it's done with the final interface and done by the **actual user**, which **goes through the system**, **testing his own workflows and use-cases**.
