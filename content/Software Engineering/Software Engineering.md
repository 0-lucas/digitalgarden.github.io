# What is it?

*Software engineering* is a field that concerns with the **design**, **development**, **testing**, and **maintenance** of software applications. The idea is to **manage the process of software development as a project**, instead of letting each developer write its own code, isolated. 

In other words, it's the  **application of a systematic approach to software development**, that is, the **application of engineering to software**.

Some processes are fundamental to *software engineering*, and **should be done to every new software project**:

- #### Specifications
	All **functionality**, **restrictions**, and **scope**, should be **well defined** before development.

- #### Development
	The *software* needs to be **developed** in a way that it **complies with the specifications**.

- #### Validation
	The *software* needs to be **validated before shipping** to the user, ensuring that it **meets the user's expectation**.

- #### Evolution
	The *software* needs to **evolve to meet any changes** in the requirements or needs of the user **along it's life cycle**.

# Process models

Implementing the *process of a software* is normally given by the chosen **process model**. A *software [[Process Models|process model]]* is an **abstraction of the development process**. They can be divided in two different categories:

- #### Prescriptive process models
	Mostly **linear life cycles**, it's the traditional *[[Process Models|process model]]* *, which organizes each activity of *software development*, like **methodology**, **tasks**, **quality control**, and **change control** for each project.

- #### Agile process models
	*[[Agile]] [[Process Models|process models]]* refers to a faster, more dynamic approach, with **shorter iterations**, which the **result is measured by the finished product**, contrary to *prescriptive process models*, which **result is measured by defined metrics for each step**.
