# What is it?

The *Law of Large Numbers* is a important **limit theorem** in [[Statistics]] and [[Probability]], which creates the base for **assuming characteristics from a sample to the entire population**.

The basic idea behind the *law of large numbers* is that if you **repeat an experiment independently, after some number of times, the average of all results should be close to the expected value of said experiment**.

>[!tip] Averaging values to get better accuracy
> In general, one **can't just measure a process once** and determine that the measured value is a good estimate. Commonly, statisticians **measure a process a repeated number of times** and **average all values** to get said estimate, which is **less sensitive to uncontrolled variance** of the first case.
