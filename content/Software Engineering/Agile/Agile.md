# What is it?

In [[Software Engineering]], *Agile methods* were created to fix some issues from **traditional prescriptive [[Process Models|process models]]**, which **didn't developed software fast** or competent enough, while also **putting a heavy burden on developers**. More time was spent on planning, than on developing and testing.

*Agile*, on the other hand, **encourages team members to communicate**, **to deliver software faster**, and **flexibilizes** planning and change management, **incorporating the user feedback continuously** throughout the software development.

# The principles of Agile
The *Manifesto for Agile Software Development* states **four core principles** which any *agile* team should follow:

- ##### **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

- ##### **Working software** over comprehensive documentation

- ##### **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

- ##### **Responding to change** over following a plan

*Agile* also **breaks the extensive and long phases** of traditional methods into smaller pieces, called **iterations**. At the end of each **iteration**, a deliverable functionality needs to be deployed to be used by the user.

All of this serves to **value team members and communication** instead of relying on a *set-in-stone* plan **which can or cannot** be used by the end user.

The *Agile Alliance* also states **twelve minor agility principles** to be followed:

Most commonly, teams use *agile-based frameworks* to implement *agility* in a project. These frameworks can vary its principles and methods, but carry on the ***agile* principles**, like [[Scrum]] and [[Extreme Programming]].
