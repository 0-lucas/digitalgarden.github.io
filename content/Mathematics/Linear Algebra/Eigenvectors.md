# What is it?

In [[Linear Algebra]], an *eigenvector* is a [[Vectors|vector]] which is associated with a *square* [[Matrices|matrix]], and have **multiple interpretations** depending on the applied context.
In [[Euclidean Geometry]], an *eigenvector* is such that a *[[Matrix Multiplication|matrix-vector multiplication]]* acts like a *scalar-vector multiplication*. This is expressed as:

$$
\mathbf{Av} = \lambda \mathbf{v}
$$
>[!tip] These are not equal!
> The equality of $\mathbf{Av} = \lambda \mathbf{v}$ expresses that
