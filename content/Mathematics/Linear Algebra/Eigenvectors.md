# What is it?

In [[Linear Algebra]], an *eigenvector* is a [[Vectors|vector]] which is associated with a *square* [[Matrices|matrix]], and have **multiple interpretations** depending on the applied context.
In [[Euclidean Geometry]], an *eigenvector* is such that a *[[Matrix Multiplication|matrix-vector multiplication]]* acts like a *scalar-vector multiplication*. This is expressed as:

$$
\mathbf{Av} = \lambda \mathbf{v}
$$
>[!tip] These are not equal!
> The equality of $\mathbf{Av} = \lambda \mathbf{v}$ expresses that the effect of the [[Matrices|matrix]] $\mathbf{A}$ on the [[Vectors|vector]] $\mathbf{v}$ is the **same as the effect** of the *scalar* $\lambda$ on the same [[Vectors|vector]].

The concept of *eigenvectors* need [[Eigenvalues]] to complement is meaning. The [[Eigenvalues]] are expressed as the *scalar $\lambda$*, while *eigenvectors* are the [[Vectors|vector]] $\mathbf{v}$.

When working [[Vector Spaces]], *eigenvectors* will change only by a *scalar $\lambda$* after applying a [[Linear Transformations|linear transformation]] to a *subspace*, and **it will not move**, but **only *stretch*** by the *scalar $\lambda$*.
