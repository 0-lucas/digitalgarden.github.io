*Matrix multiplication* is quite a extensive operation to do. When multiplying a matrix $A$ by another matrix $B$, each **element from the result matrix** $C$ is calculated by the *rows* of $A$ times the *columns* of $B$.

Before attempting, one should guarantee that **the numbers of *columns* from $A$ is equal to the number of *rows* from $B$**. The result $C$ will have the number of rows from $A$ and the columns from $B$.
$$
\begin{align}
&A_{m\times n} * B_{p\times q} = C_{m\times q} \\
&\text{given that } n= p. 
\end{align}
