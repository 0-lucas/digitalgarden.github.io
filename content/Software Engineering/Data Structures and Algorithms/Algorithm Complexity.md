# What is it?

To compare the performance of any [[Algorithms|algorithm]] for the same application, one can compare the *complexity* of those [[Algorithms|algorithms]].

In general, an [[Algorithms|algorithm]] is considered **more efficient when it's less complex**.

# Types of complexity

There are two types of *algorithm complexity*:

- #### Size complexity
	Refers to the **allocated memory required** to run the [[Algorithms|algorithm]]. For example, the **number and size** of the **variables**. The **data size is referred** as $n$.

- #### Time complexity
	Refers to the number of **needed instructions** to run the [[Algorithms|algorithm]]. This is important because it's **directly related to the time it takes** to run the [[Algorithms|algorithm]].

___
# Big-O Notation

The most widely used way of comparing the *complexity* of different [[Algorithms|algorithms]] is the [[Big-O Notation]].

The [[Big-O Notation]] refers to the **possible worst case** of the execution, and it's related to *time complexity*, specifying the number of **operations it'll perform on each data point.**
