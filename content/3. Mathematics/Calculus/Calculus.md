*Calculus* is the [[Mathematics|mathematical]] study of **continuous change**. Just as **geometry** focuses on shape and **algebra** deals with generalizations of arithmetic operations, calculus delves into understanding how things change over time or space.

The main fields of calculus are [[Differentiation]] which studies the **rate of change** and [[Integration]], which is used to calculate areas and volumes.
