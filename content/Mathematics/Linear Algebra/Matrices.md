# What is it?

*Matrices* is used in [[Mathematics]], mainly in [[Linear Algebra]] to represent a *mathematical object*, or the property of said subject. They can **store various different values** inside of them.

*Matrices* can be thought of just like *tables*. They have a **two-dimensional** projection with $m \times n$ elements organized in $m$ *rows* and $n$ *columns*.
It forms a **rectangular [[Arrays|array]]**, which in itself, can also be used to build *matrices*.

The most common notation is $A = m \times n$, where $A$ is the *matrix variable*, $m$ the number of *rows* and $n$ the number of *columns*. We can also **express a filled *matrix*** $A = 2 \times 3$ like this:

$$

A_{2\times3}=
\begin{bmatrix}  
1 & 2 & 3\\  
a & b & c  
\end{bmatrix}
$$

You can also **identify each element of the *matrix***, using the notation $x_{mn}$, where $x$ is the **element name**. Applied to the above *matrix*:

$$
A_{2\times3}=
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
