# What is it?
 
*Linear regression* is a widely used [[Statistical Modelling|statistical model]] used to determine the [[Correlation]] between a *dependent variable*, that you're **trying to predict**, and a *independent variable*, which you're **basing the prediction on**.

In [[Statistics]] and [[Machine Learning]], a *linear regression* model tries to capture the **linear relationship** between **two** or **more variables**, in a way that it produces an **equation** that **approximates a prediction for any point in the known data range**.

# The statistical model

The [[Statistical Modelling|statistical model]] for *linear regression* is a **linear function**, given by a pair of data $x$ and $y$. The **dependent variable** is given by $y$, and the **independent variables** is $x$.

Given $\beta$ as the **angular coefficient**, $\alpha$ as the **linear coefficient**, and $\epsilon$ as the **random error**, one can write a *simple linear regression model* as:
$$
y_i = \alpha + \beta * x_i + \epsilon
$$

This assumes the data is **linearly correlated**.
