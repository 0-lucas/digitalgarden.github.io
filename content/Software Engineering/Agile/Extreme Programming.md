# Applying Extreme Programming

*Extreme Programming* is **better suited for smaller teams** working with **dynamic software requirements**, **managing goals instead of activities** and working together.

*Software development* in *XP* is based on [[Test Driven Development]], with the **objective of providing the better software possible**. *Pair programming* also makes a huge impact, once it can **prevent bugs from  happening** at the time its being coded. This makes it so that **developers prove that the code works**, instead of the customer proving the code is broken.
