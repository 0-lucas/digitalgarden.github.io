# What is it?

*Big-O notation* is the most common way of comparing the [[Algorithm Complexity]] between different [[Algorithms]]. It refers to the mathematical function that describes the *order of magnitude* of the **functions executed on each data point $n$**.

When using *Big-O*, is also known as the **worst case scenario** of an [[Algorithms|algorithm]], which can be affected by how the data is presented â€” if it's sorted, distinct, etc.

# Understanding Big-O

To write a *Big-O notation* of any mathematical function describing an [[Algorithms|algorithm]], one would just **consider the element of highest order**.

*Big-O* is not a direct translation of the time it'll take to run an [[Algorithms|algorithm]]. The time needed to run any step is **directly dependent on the hardware** laco forand **on the data size** $n$.

A bigger *Big-O* value means that the [[Algorithms|algorithm]] is **more complex**, taking more time to run.

# Finding Big-O

To discover the *Big-O notation* of any given [[Algorithms|algorithm]], one need to analyze the operation done in the code.

- #### No repetition
	For any code that doesn't contain a *repetition structure*, like the `for loop` or a [[Recursion]], with **no dependency of the input data**, the *Big-O* notation is $O(1)$.

- #### Single repetition
	A code that **walks through every single data point**, performing a given procedure, **only once**, can be considered $O(n)$.

>[!tip] The sum property
> Every time a code block follows **another independent code block**, each *Big-O* notation is summed. 
> However, a **sum doesn't change the order** of the *Big-O* function.

- #### Nested repetition
	*Nested repetition structures* walk through **every single data point for every data point**. So a `for loop` inside another `for loop` results in $O(n^2)$

>[!tip] The multiplication property
> A *nested* code block inside another code block creates a *dependency relationship* between blocks. In this case, each *Big-O* notation in multiplied.
> For a number of nesting $i$, the *Big-O* notation is $O(n^i)$.

## Divide and Conquer algorithms

The *divide and conquer* strategy is based on **reducing the original dimension $n$ of a problem** to other sub-problems, which are **recursively divided** to other sub-problems.

This commonly reduces the complexity of a $O(n)$ [[Algorithms|algorithm]] to $O(\log n)$. This happens because instead of going to every possible data point, we can **recursively solve smaller problems** and **combine them** to find the **answer of the original problem.**
