# What is it?

In [[Software Engineering]], development of a *software* most commonly follows some **established framework or process**, so that it can be **systematically approached**. The way the development is managed is determined by its *process model*.
A *software [[Process Models|process model]]*, also called **lifecycle model**, is an **abstraction of the development process**, with all the **internal workforce and external factors included**. They can be divided in two different categories:

- #### Prescriptive process models
	Mostly **linear life cycles**, it's the traditional *process model*, which organizes each activity of *software development*, like **methodology**, **tasks**, **quality control**, and **change control** for each project.

- #### Agile process models
	*[[Agile]]* *process models* refers to a faster, more dynamic approach, with **shorter iterations**, which the **result is measured by the finished product**, contrary to *prescriptive process models*, which **result is measured by defined metrics for each step**.
