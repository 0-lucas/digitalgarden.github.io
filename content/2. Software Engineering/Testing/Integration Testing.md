# What is it?

In [[Software Testing]], *integration tests* are made when [[Unit Testing]] is done and units are **ready to be integrated into the system**. *Integration testing* only happens **when all units are have passed** through [[Unit Testing]].

The objective is to **check any errors or faults between different units** when they **interact among themselves in the integration**.
