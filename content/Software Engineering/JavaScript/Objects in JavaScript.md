# What is it?

In [[JavaScript]], the *object* data type is used to **store key-value collections** and complex data structures. It can be thought as an **entity having *state* and *behavior*, which are implemented as *properties* and *methods***.

# Defining objects

To create an *object*, one can create it using the *object literal*, using the `let` or `const` keyword, or with an *object* constructor.

## Using the object literal

We can create *objects* using the *{ } literal*. This is a fast way to create any object, but not as flexible as other options.

```javascript
let myself = {
	name: "Lucas",
	favoriteBand: "Radiohead"
};

```
