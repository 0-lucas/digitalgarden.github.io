# What is it?

In a [[MVC]] application, the *controller* is the **layer responsible** for receiving all [[HTTP]] requests from the user, **interpreting it**, **requesting data from the [[Models|model]]**, and returning it to the [[Views|view]]. In other words, it connects the [[Views|view]] and the [[Models|model]].
