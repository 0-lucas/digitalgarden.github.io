# What is it?

*Java* is an *interpreted*, *compiled*, *multi-platform*, *strong-typed*, [[Object-Oriented Programming|object-oriented programming language]], created in 1995 by [James Gosling](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling).

*Java* is compiled into *bytecode*, which then is interpreted by the *JVM*, which stands for **Java Virtual Machine**. The *JVM* is what makes *Java* be **compatible with any system.** If the hardware runs *JVM*, it also runs *Java*.

*Java* also implements *JDK*, which stands for **Java Development Kit**, which is **all the development tools used in the development process**. It also uses the *JRE*, which is the **Java Runtime Environment**, which is the **environment used for running the application after compilation**.
