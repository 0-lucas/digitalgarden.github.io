# What is it?

# Types of requirements

# Gathering requirements

*Requirements* can be gathered through **interviews with the end user**, where the development team can **question the user** about its **use cases**, **objectives**, and **possible scenarios** that could happen.
Another great way to gather requirements is to **immerse a member of the development team into the routine of the user**. This way, the developer can **absorb little details** that could otherwise be unknown to the user.

# Writing requirements

After gathered, all *requirements* can be documented using multiple methods, like natural language, templates *(like an Excel spreadsheet)*, graphical notation *(like diagrams and **UML**)*, and mathematical notation.
