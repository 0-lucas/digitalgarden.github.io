# What is it?

In [[Mathematics]], the *Gaussian elimination method* is used in [[Linear Algebra]] as a **row reduction algorithm** for solving linear systems. All operations are made on **the [[Matrices|matrix]] of coefficients**.

The objective is to **reduce the [[Matrices|matrix]] to a *upper triangular matrix***, so that each **equation can be rewritten** in a way that is possible to solve. This is done using the [[Elementary Operations of Matrix]].
