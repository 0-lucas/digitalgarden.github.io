# What is it?

*Variance* is a [[Statistics|statistical measurement]], mainly used in [[Descriptive Statistics]]. *Variance* measures how **far each data point is from the mean**, which can be interpreted as the **average squared error to the mean**.

# Calculating the variance

Given $x$ as **the variable**, $\overline{x}$ as the **mean value of the variable**, and $n$ as the **total number of data points**, one can apply the following formula to get the *standard deviation* of a variable:
$$
\sigma = \frac{\sum(x_i - \overline{x})^2}{n}
$$
>[!tip] *Variance* vs Standard deviation
>The formula used for *variance* can be thought as one of the steps to calculate the [[Standard Deviation]]. In fact, *variance* can be interpreted as the **squared [[Standard Deviation]]**.
