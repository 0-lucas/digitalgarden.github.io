# What is it?

In [[Statistics]], *ANOVA* stands for **analysis of variance**. It's a [[Statistical Modelling|statistical model]] widely used to **compare if two samples are drawn from the same population**. It tests for **statistically significant difference between different groups or samples**.

>[!caution] ANOVA's assumptions
>Any *ANOVA* model assumes that the variables are [[Normal Distribution|normally distributed]] and *i.i.d.* - independent and identically distributed.

# Types of ANOVA

When used with a **single shared variable between groups**, is referred as [[One-Way ANOVA]], being a **one-dimensional** analysis.

Applied to two or more variables, it **captures relationships in multiple dependent variables**, being a **more reliable tool** that takes into account different variables. This procedure is called [[Multivariate ANOVA]].

# Interpreting ANOVAplotting residuals

Given that the *null hypothesis* states that **all samples means are equal**, and a given *significance level* also called [[p-value]], $\alpha$ , normally set at $a = 0.05$, we can interpret an *ANOVA* table using some highlight points.

## Checking if means are significantly differently

To determine if the means between each group are **statistically different**, we look at the *$PR(F)$ value*. To be able to **reject the *null hypothesis***, this value needs to be $PR(F) < \alpha$. This would mean the means are **actually different**.

This is also done by checking the [[F-statistic]] and consulting *Snedecor's* [[F-Distribution]].
___
## Examine each mean

You can also perform an *interval plot* of each group, and check its [[Confidence Interval]].
___
## Check fitting and residuals

Metrics like [[Coefficient of Determination|R squared]] can help to determine if the fitting explained the [[Variance]] present in the data, while **plotting residuals** and checking [[Heteroscedasticity]], [[Normal Distribution|normality]] and if **are there any systematic pattern**, can help to determine if the model didn't capture some relationship.
