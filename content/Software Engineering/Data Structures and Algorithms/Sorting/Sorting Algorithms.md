# What is it?

A *sorting [[Algorithms|algorithm]]* is a set of instructions that **rearrange an [[Array|array]] in a particular order**, normally set as **ascending or descending**. This depends on the nature of the [[Array|array]] type.

For numerical [[Array|arrays]], one could just apply **an ascending rule**, but the same would need changes to work with string [[Array|arrays]].

There are various *sorting methods*, with each having it's own benefits, from **memory and CPU usage** to [[Algorithm Complexity|time complexity]], normally measured in [[Big-O Notation]].
