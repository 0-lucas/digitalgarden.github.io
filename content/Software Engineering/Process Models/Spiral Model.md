# What is it?

In [[Software Engineering]], the *spiral model* is an **incremental-based** [[Process Models|process model]], which provides **shorter lead times** for each functionality while being **flexible to changes in the requirements**.

The idea is to **start the system with smaller projects**, analyzing its risks and **prototype and test these smaller sub-projects**. This way, the developer can identify any **potential risk that was unknown until writing the code itself**.

Then, after a **complete validation** of potential risks to the system and **benchmarking the operational prototype**, the final steps to be made are similar to a [[Waterfall Model]].
