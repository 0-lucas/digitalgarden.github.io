# What is it?

In [[Software Engineering]], the *V model*  is a [[Process Models|process model]] created to solve some issues of the **its predecessor**, the [[Waterfall Model]].

It states **new phases** made to **validate the planning phases**. It also **differs its general step-by-step** from the [[Waterfall Model]].

# Stages / step-by-step

 - ### Requirements analysis and definition
	It's **business usage**, **problems to be solved**, **services**, **constraints** and **goals** are established with the team of developers and potential users, **defining each [[Requirements|requirements]]in detail** to serve as a **system specification**.

- ### Architectural design
	The development team **organizes each [[Requirements|requirements]] in *program units***, which **defines** how each part of the **system's architecture will connect with each other**.

- ### Detailed design
	The development team will **delve deeper** into each part of the system, taking decision to **how it will be implemented**.

- ### Implementation
	The *software* is deployed to the users **meeting its specifications**.

- ### Unit testing and system test
	[[Unit Testing]] refers to the validation of all *program units*, checking if all of them **meet the [[Requirements|requirements]] of the *detailed design* phase**. The project **only proceeds if all tests pass** and the system **follows all requirements**.

- ### Operation and Maintenance
	After the system is deployed, this stage concerns to **correct errors not discovered in past stages**, and adding new functionality as **new [[Requirements|requirements]] are discovered**.
