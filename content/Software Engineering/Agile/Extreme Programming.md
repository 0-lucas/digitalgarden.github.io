# What is it?

*Extreme Programming*, also called *XP*, is an [[Agile]] methodology used for [[Software Engineering]] teams, which encourages **incremental changes and fast feedback** while maintaining **software quality** over the life cycle of the project.

# Applying Extreme Programming

*Extreme Programming* is **better suited for smaller teams** working with **dynamic software requirements**, **managing goals instead of activities** and working together.

*Software development* in *XP* is based on [[Test Driven Development]], with the **objective of providing the better software possible**. *Pair programming* also makes a huge impact, once it can **prevent bugs from happening** at the time its being coded. This makes it so that **developers prove that the code works**, instead of the customer proving the code is broken.

## Life cycle of Extreme Programming

The *life cycle* of an *XP* project follows five steps:

- ### Planning
	Clients define their needs in descriptions known as **user stories**. The development team then transform **user stories** to separate **tasks**, which each will have its own **time and effort estimates**.

- ### Design
	The development team, based on the *user stories*, **will decide which** programming language, environment, framework and [[Software Architecture|architecture]] so be used in the product.

- ### Coding
	The development team will actually code. This is **done in iterations** of [[Test Driven Development]], with regular testing and *pair programming*, with the objective of **detecting bugs early** in the process.

- ### Testing
	The development team write [[Automated Testing|automated tests]] to **ensure that the code is working as expected**. This guarantees that bad code is not delivered to the user.

- ### Listening
	At this point, the software must be **delivered to the customer**, which will provide **feedback and inputs to make it better**.
