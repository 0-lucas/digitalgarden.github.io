# What is it?

A *hash function* is a *[[Mathematics|mathematical]] function* or *logical [[Algorithms|algorithm]]* that takes an *input* and returns a *fixed-size string of bytes*, being typically interpreted as a *number*, called **hash code** or **hash value**.

The ideia is to either:

- ##### Map data of different size to fixed-size values for ***cryptography***

- ##### Map data to indexes used in [[Hash Tables]]
