# What is it?

In [[Computer Science]] and [[Software Engineering]], *data structures* are the fundamental block of **storing**, **organizing** and **manipulating data** within a program.

# Classifications of data structures

A *data structure* can be drastically different from another. Classifying them may help in understanding how they differ.

- ### Linear structures
	A *linear data structure* is one which **elements are arranged sequentially**, attached to previous or next adjacent elements. They can be either *dynamic* or *static*, depending if they **support updating memory size at runtime or not**.
	For example, [[Arrays]] and [[Linked Lists]] are considered *linear structures*.

- ### Non linear structures
	A *non linear structure* is one which **elements are not placed in sequence**. In this case, it's may be not possible to traverse all elements in a single run.
	[[Binary Trees]] and [[Graphs]] are considered *non linear structures*.
