# What is it?

*Software engineering* is a field that concerns with the **design**, **development**, **testing**, and **maintenance** of software applications. The idea is to **manage the process of software development as a project**, instead of letting each developer write its own code, isolated. 

Some processes are fundamental to *software engineering*, and **should be done to every new software project**:

- #### Specifications
	All **functionality**, **restrictions**, and **scope**, should be **well defined** before development.

- #### Development
	The *software* needs to be **developed** in a way that it **complies with the specifications**.

- #### Validation
	The *software* needs to be **validated before shipping** to the user, ensuring that it **meets the user's expectation**.

- #### Evolution
	The *software* needs to **evolve to meet any changes** in the requirements or needs of the user **along it's life cycle**.
