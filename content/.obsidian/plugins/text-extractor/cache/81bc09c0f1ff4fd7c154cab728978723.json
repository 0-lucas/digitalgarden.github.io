Others who have no intention of ever studying the subject have this notion that calculus is impossibly difficult unless you happen to be a direct descendant of Einstein. Well, I’m here to tell you that you can master calculus. It’s not nearly as tough as its mystique would lead you to think. Much of calculus is really just very advanced algebra, geometry, and trig. It builds upon and is a logical extension of those subjects. If you can do algebra, geometry, and trig, you can do calculus. But why should you bother — apart from being required to take a course? Why climb Mt. Ever- est? Why listen to Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony? Why visit the Louvre to see the Mona Lisa? Why watch South Park? Like these endeavors, doing calculus can be its own reward. There are many who say that calculus is one of the crowning achievements in all of intellectual history. As such, it’s worth the effort. Read this jargon-free book, get a handle on calculus, and join the happy few who can proudly say, “Calculus? Oh, sure, I know calculus. It’s no big deal.” About This Book Calculus All-in-One For Dummies is intended for three groups of readers: students taking their first calculus course, students who need to brush up on their calculus to prepare for other stud- ies, and adults of all ages who’d like a good introduction to the subject either to satisfy their own curiosity or perhaps to help someone else with calculus. If you’re enrolled in a calculus course and you find your textbook less than crystal clear, this is the book for you. It covers the most important topics in the first year of calculus: differentia- tion, integration, and infinite series. If you’ve had elementary calculus, but it’s been a couple of years and you want to review the concepts to prepare for, say, some graduate program, Calculus All-in-One For Dummies will give you a thorough, no-nonsense refresher course. Non-student readers will find the book’s exposition clear and accessible. Calculus All-in-One For Dummies takes calculus out of the ivory tower and brings it down to earth. This is a user-friendly math book. Whenever possible, I explain the calculus concepts by show- ing you connections between the calculus ideas and easier ideas from algebra and geometry. I then show you how the calculus concepts work using concrete examples. Only later do I give you the fancy calculus formulas. All explanations are in plain English, not math-speak. 2 Calculus All-in-One For Dummies The following conventions keep the text consistent and oh-so-easy to follow: » Variables are in italics. » Calculus terms are italicized and defined when they first appear in the text. » In the step-by-step problem-solving methods, the general action you need to take is in bold, followed by the specifics of the particular problem. It can be a great aid to true understanding of calculus  — or any math topic for that matter — to focus on the why in addition to the how-to. With this in mind, I’ve put a lot of effort into explaining the underlying logic of many of the ideas in this book. If you want to give your study of calculus a solid foundation, you should read these explanations. But if you’re really in a hurry, you can cut to the chase and read only the important introductory stuff, the example problems, the step-by-step solutions, and all the rules and definitions next to the icons. You can read the remaining exposition later only if you feel the need. I find the sidebars interesting and entertaining. (What do you expect? I wrote them!) But you can skip them without missing any essential calculus. No, you won’t be tested on that stuff. The most important thing is for you to work out the “Your Turn” example problems and the problems in the end-of-chapter quizzes (solutions are provided). You can’t learn calculus (or any type of math) without working out dozens or hundreds of problems. If you want even more practice problems, you can find more chapter quizzes online. Foolish Assumptions Call me crazy, but I assume » You know at least the basics of algebra, geometry, and trig. If you’re rusty, Unit 2 (and the online Cheat Sheet) contains a good review of these pre-calculus topics. Actually, if you’re not currently taking a calculus course, and you’re reading this book just to satisfy a general curiosity about calculus, you can get a good conceptual picture of the subject without the nitty-gritty details of algebra, geometry, and trig. But you won’t, in that case, be able to follow all the problem solutions. In short, without the pre-calculus stuff, you can see the cal- culus forest, but not the trees. If you’re enrolled in a calculus course, you’ve got no choice — you’ve got to know the trees as well as the forest. » You’re willing to do some w_ _ _. No, not the dreaded w-word! Yes, that’s w-o-r-k, work. I’ve tried to make this material as accessible as possible, but it is calculus after all. You can’t learn calculus by just listening to a tape in your car or taking a pill — not yet anyway. Is that too much to ask? Introduction 3 Icons Used in This Book Keep your eyes on the icons: Next to this icon are calculus rules, definitions, and formulas. These are things you need to know from algebra, geometry, or trig, or things you should recall from earlier in the book. The lightbulb icon appears next to things that will make your life easier. Take note. This icon highlights common calculus mistakes. Take heed. Each example is a calculus problem that illustrates the topic just discussed, followed by a step-by-step solution. Studying these example problems and their solutions will help you solve the “Your Turn” practice problems and the problems in the end-of-chapter quizzes. This icon means it’s time to put on your thinking cap. It appears next to practice problems for you to work out. Some of these problems will be quite similar to the example problems from the same section. Others will challenge you by going a bit beyond the garden-variety examples. Solutions are provided. Beyond the Book There’s some great supplementary calculus material online that you might want to check out. To view this book’s online Cheat Sheet, simply go to www.dummies.com and type Calculus All in One For Dummies Cheat Sheet in the Search box. You’ll find a nice list of important formulas, theorems, definitions, and so on from algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus. This is a great place to go if you forget a formula.

I don’t get what all the fuss is about.” — SAM EINSTEIN, ALBERT’S GREAT-GRANDSON I n this chapter, I answer the question, “What is calculus?” in plain English, and I give you real-world examples of how calculus is used. After reading this and the following two short chapters, you will understand what calculus is all about. But here’s a twist: Why don’t you start out on the wrong foot by briefly checking out what calculus is not? What Calculus Is Not No sense delaying the inevitable. Ready for your first calculus test?

Chapter 1 IN THIS CHAPTER » You’re only in Chapter 1 and you’re already going to get your first calc test » Calculus — it’s just souped-up regular math » Zooming in is the key » The world before and after calculus 8 UNIT 1 An Overview of Calculus False, false, false! There’s this mystique about calculus that it’s this ridiculously difficult, incred- ibly arcane subject that no one in their right mind would sign up for unless it was a required course. Don’t buy into this misconception. Sure, calculus is difficult — I’m not going to lie to you — but it’s manageable, doable. You made it through algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. Well, calculus just picks up where they leave off — it’s simply the next step in a logical progression. Calculus is relevant. Calculus is not a dead language like Latin, spoken only by academics. It’s the language of engineers, scientists, and economists. Okay, so it’s a couple steps removed from your everyday life and unlikely to come up at a cocktail party. But the work of those engineers, scientists, and economists has a huge impact on your day-to-day life  — from your microwave oven, cellphone, TV, and car to the medicines you take, the workings of the economy, and our national defense. At this very moment, something within your reach or within your view has been impacted by calculus. So What Is Calculus, Already? Calculus is basically just very advanced algebra and geometry. In one sense, it’s not even a new subject — it takes the ordinary rules of algebra and geometry and tweaks them so that they can be used on more complicated problems. (The rub, of course, is that darn other sense in which it is a new and more difficult subject.) Look at Figure 1-1. On the left is a man pushing a crate up a straight incline. On the right, the man is pushing the same crate up a curving incline. The problem, in both cases, is to determine the amount of energy required to push the crate to the top. You can do the problem on the left with regular math. For the one on the right, you need calculus (assuming you don’t know the physics shortcuts). For the straight incline, the man pushes with an unchanging force, and the crate goes up the incline at an unchanging speed. With some simple physics formulas and regular math (includ- ing algebra and trig), you can compute how many calories of energy are required to push the crate up the incline. Note that the amount of energy expended each second remains the same. FIGURE 1-1:  The difference between regular math and calculus: In a word, it’s the curve. CHAPTER 1 What Is Calculus? 9 For the curving incline, on the other hand, things are constantly changing. The steepness of the incline is changing — and not just in increments like it’s one steepness for the first 3 feet then a different steepness for the next 3 feet. It’s constantly changing. And the man pushes with a constantly changing force — the steeper the incline, the harder the push. As a result, the amount of energy expended is also changing, not every second or every thousandth of a second, but constantly changing from one moment to the next. That’s what makes it a calculus problem. Calculus is the mathematics of change. By this time, it should come as no surprise to you that calculus is described as “the mathematics of change.” Calculus takes the regular rules of math and applies them to fluid, evolving problems. For the curving incline problem, the physics formulas remain the same, and the algebra and trig you use stay the same. The difference is that — in contrast to the straight incline problem, which you can sort of do in a single shot — you’ve got to break up the curving incline problem into small chunks and do each chunk separately. Figure 1-2 shows a small portion of the curv- ing incline blown up to several times its size. When you zoom in far enough, the small length of the curving incline becomes practically straight. Then, because it’s straight, you can solve that small chunk just like the straight incline problem. Each small chunk can be solved the same way, and then you just add up all the chunks. That’s calculus in a nutshell. It takes a problem that can’t be done with regular math because things are constantly changing — the changing quantities show up on a graph as curves — it zooms in on the curve till it becomes straight, and then it finishes off the problem with regular math. What makes the invention of calculus such a fantastic achievement is that it does what seems impossible: It zooms in infinitely. As a matter of fact, everything in calculus involves infinity in one way or another, because if something is constantly changing, it’s changing infinitely often from each infinitesimal moment to the next. Real-World Examples of Calculus So, with regular math you can do the straight incline problem; with calculus you can do the curving incline problem. Here are some more examples. FIGURE 1-2:  Zooming in on the curve — voilà, it’s straight (almost). 10 UNIT 1 An Overview of Calculus With regular math you can determine the length of a buried cable that runs diagonally from one corner of a park to the other (remember the Pythagorean Theorem?). With calculus you can determine the length of a cable hung between two towers that has the shape of a catenary (which is different, by the way, from a simple circular arc or a parabola). Knowing the exact length is of obvious importance to a power company planning hundreds of miles of new electric cable. See Figure 1-3. You can calculate the area of the flat roof of a home with ordinary geometry. With calculus you can compute the area of complicated, nonspherical shapes like the shapes of some sports arena domes. Architects designing such a building need to know the dome’s area to determine the cost of materials and to figure the weight of the dome (with and without snow on it). The weight, of course, is needed for planning the strength of the supporting structure. Check out Figure 1-4. With regular math and some simple physics, you can calculate how much a quarterback must lead his receiver to complete a pass. (I’m assuming here that the receiver runs in a straight line and at a constant speed.) But when NASA, in 1975, calculated the necessary “lead” for aiming the Viking I at Mars, it needed calculus because both the Earth and Mars travel on elliptical orbits (of different shapes) and the speeds of both are constantly changing — not to mention the fact that on its way to Mars, the spacecraft is affected by the different and constantly changing gravitational pulls of the Earth, the Moon, Mars, and the Sun. See Figure 1-5. FIGURE 1-3:  Without and with calculus. FIGURE 1-4:  Sans and avec calculus. CHAPTER 1 What Is Calculus? 11 You see many real-world applications of calculus throughout this book. The differentiation problems in Unit 4 all involve the steepness of a curve  — like the steepness of the curving incline in Figure  1-1. In Unit 5, you do integration problems like the cable-length problem shown back in Figure 1-3. These problems involve breaking up something into little sections, calculating each section, and then adding up the sections to get the total. More about that in Chapter 2. FIGURE 1-5:  B.C.E. (Before the Calculus Era) and C.E. (the Calculus Era). CHAPTER 2 The Two Big Ideas of Calculus: Differentiation and Integration — Plus Infinite Series 13 The Two Big Ideas of Calculus: Differentiation and Integration — Plus Infinite Series T his book covers the two main topics in calculus — differentiation and integration — as well as a third topic, infinite series. All three topics touch the earth and the heavens because all are built upon the rules of ordinary algebra and geometry, and all involve the idea of infinity. Defining Differentiation Differentiation is the process of finding the derivative of a curve. And the word “derivative” is just the fancy calculus term for the curve’s slope or steepness. And because the slope of a curve is equivalent to a simple rate (like miles per hour or profit per item), the derivative is a rate as well as a slope. Chapter 2 IN THIS CHAPTER » Delving into the derivative: It’s a rate and a slope » Investigating the integral — addition for experts » Infinite series: Achilles versus the tortoise — place your bets 14 UNIT 1 An Overview of Calculus The derivative is a slope In algebra, you learned about the slope of a line — it’s equal to the ratio of the rise to the run. In other words, Slope rise run . See Figure 2-1. Let me guess: A sudden rush of algebra nostalgia is flooding over you. In Figure 2-1, the rise is half as long as the run, so the line has a slope of 1 2. On a curve, the slope is constantly changing, so you need calculus to determine its slope. See Figure 2-2. Just like the line in Figure  2-1, the straight line between A and B in Figure  2-2 has a slope of 1 2. And the slope of this line is the same at every point between A and B. But you can see that, unlike the line, the steepness of the curve is changing between A and B. At A, the curve is less steep than the line, and at B, the curve is steeper than the line. What do you do if you want the exact slope at, say, point C? Can you guess? Time’s up. Answer: You zoom in. See Figure 2-3. When you zoom in far enough — really far, actually infinitely far — the little piece of the curve becomes straight, and you can figure the slope the old-fashioned way. That’s how differenti- ation works. FIGURE 2-1:  The slope of a line equals the rise over the run. FIGURE 2-2:  The slope of a curve isn’t so simple. FIGURE 2-3:  Zooming in on the curve. CHAPTER 2 The Two Big Ideas of Calculus: Differentiation and Integration — Plus Infinite Series 15 The derivative is a rate Because the derivative of a curve is the slope — which equals rise run or rise per run — the deriva- tive is also a rate, a this per that like miles per hour or gallons per minute (the name of the particu- lar rate simply depends on the units used on the x- and y-axes). The two graphs in Figure 2-4 show a relationship between distance and time — they could represent a trip in your car. A regular algebra problem is shown on the left in Figure  2-4. If you know the x- and y-coordinates of points A and B, you can use the slope formula Slope rise run yy xx 21 21 to cal- culate the slope between A and B, and, in this problem, that slope gives you the average rate in miles per hour for the interval from A to B. For the problem on the right, on the other hand, you need calculus. (You can’t use the slope formula because you’ve only got one point.) Using the derivative of the curve, you can deter- mine the exact slope or steepness at point C. Just to the left of C on the curve, the slope is slightly lower, and just to the right of C on the curve, the slope is slightly higher. But precisely at C, for a single infinitesimal moment, you get a slope that’s different from the neighboring slopes. The slope for this single infinitesimal point on the curve gives you the instantaneous rate in miles per hour at point C. Investigating Integration Integration is the second big idea in calculus, and it’s basically just fancy addition. Integration is the process of cutting up an area into tiny sections, figuring the areas of the small sections, and then adding up the little bits of area to get the whole area. Figure  2-5 shows two area problems — one that you can do with geometry and one where you need calculus. FIGURE 2-4:  Average rate and instanta- neous rate. 16 UNIT 1 An Overview of Calculus The shaded area on the left is a simple rectangle, so its area, of course, equals length times width. But you can’t figure the area on the right with regular geometry because there’s no area formula for this funny shape. So what do you do? Why, zoom in, of course. Figure 2-6 shows the top portion of a narrow strip of the weird shape blown up to several times its size. When you zoom in as shown in Figure  2-6, the curve becomes practically straight, and the further you zoom in, the straighter it gets. After zooming in, you get the shape on the right in Figure 2-6, which is practically an ordinary trapezoid (its top is still slightly curved). Well, with the magic of integration, you zoom in infinitely close (sort of — you can’t really get infinitely close, right?). At that point, the shape is exactly an ordinary trapezoid — or, if you want to get really basic, it’s a triangle sitting on top of a rectangle. Because you can compute the areas of rectangles, triangles, and trapezoids with ordinary geometry, you can get the area of this and all the other thin strips and then add up all these areas to get the total area. That’s integration. Figure 2-7 has two graphs of a city’s electrical energy consumption on a typical summer day. The horizontal axes show the number of hours after midnight, and the vertical axes show the amount of power (in kilowatts) used by the city at different times during the day. The crooked line on the left and the curve on the right show how the number of kilowatts of power depends on the time of day. In both cases, the shaded area gives the number of kilowatt- hours of energy consumed during a typical 24-hour period. The shaded area in the oversimpli- fied and unrealistic problem on the left can be calculated with regular geometry. But the true relationship between the amount of power used and the time of day is more complicated than a crooked straight line. In a realistic energy-consumption problem, you’d get something like the graph on the right. Because of its weird curve, you need calculus to determine the shaded area. In the real world, the relationship between different variables is rarely as simple as a straight- line graph. That’s what makes calculus so useful. FIGURE 2-5:  If you can’t determine the area on the left, hang up your calculator. FIGURE 2-6:  For the umpteenth time, when you zoom in, the curve becomes straight. CHAPTER 2 The Two Big Ideas of Calculus: Differentiation and Integration — Plus Infinite Series 17 Sorting Out Infinite Series Infinite series deal with the adding up of an infinite number of numbers. Don’t try this on your calculator unless you’ve got a lot of extra time on your hands. Here’s a simple example. The following sequence of numbers is generated by a simple doubling process — each term is twice the one before it: 12 48 16 32 64 128, ,,, ,, ,, The infinite series associated with this sequence of numbers is just the sum of the numbers: 12 48 16 32 64 128 Divergent series The preceding series of doubling numbers is divergent because if you continue the addition indefinitely, the sum will grow bigger and bigger without limit. And if you could add up “all” the numbers in this series — that’s all infinitely many of them — the sum would be infinity. Divergent usually means — there are exceptions — that the series adds up to infinity. Divergent series are rather uninteresting because they do what you expect. You keep adding more numbers, so the sum keeps growing, and if you continue this forever, the sum grows to infinity. Big surprise. Convergent series Convergent series are much more interesting. With a convergent series, you also keep adding more numbers, the sum keeps growing, but even though you add numbers forever and the sum grows forever, the sum of all the infinitely many terms is a finite number. This surprising result brings me to Zeno’s famous paradox of Achilles and the tortoise. (That’s Zeno of Elea, of course, from the 5th century B.C.) FIGURE 2-7:  Total kilowatt-hours of energy used by a city during a single day. 18 UNIT 1 An Overview of Calculus Achilles is racing a tortoise — some gutsy warrior, eh? Our generous hero gives the tortoise a 100-yard head start. Achilles runs at 20 mph; the tortoise “runs” at 2 mph. Zeno used the following argument to “prove” that Achilles will never catch or pass the tortoise. If you’re per- suaded by this “proof,” by the way, you’ve really got to get out more. Imagine that you’re a journalist covering the race for Spartan Sports Weekly, and you’re taking a series of photos for your article. Figure 2-8 shows the situation at the start of the race and your first two photos. You take your first photo the instant Achilles reaches the point where the tortoise started. By the time Achilles gets there, the tortoise has “raced” forward and is now 10 yards ahead of Achilles. (The tortoise moves a tenth as fast as Achilles, so in the time it takes Achilles to travel 100 yards, the tortoise covers a tenth as much ground, or 10 yards.) If you do the math, you find that it took Achilles about 10 seconds to run the 100 yards. (For the sake of argument, let’s call it exactly 10 seconds.) FIGURE 2-8:  Achilles versus the tortoise — it’s a photo finish. CHAPTER 2 The Two Big Ideas of Calculus: Differentiation and Integration — Plus Infinite Series 19 You have a cool app that allows you to look at your first photo and note precisely where the tortoise is as Achilles crosses the tortoise’s starting point. The tortoise’s position is shown as point A in the middle image in Figure  2-8. Then you take your second photo when Achilles reaches point A, which takes him about one more second. In that second, the tortoise has moved ahead 1 yard to point B. You take your third photo (not shown) when Achilles reaches point B and the tortoise has moved ahead to point C. Every time Achilles reaches the point where the tortoise was, you take another photo. There is no end to this series of photographs. Assuming you and your camera can work infinitely fast, you will take an infinite number of photos. And every single time Achilles reaches the point where the tortoise was, the tortoise has covered more ground — even if only a millimeter or a millionth of a millimeter. This process never ends, right? Thus, the argument goes, because you can never get to the end of your infinite series of photos, Achilles can never catch or pass the tortoise. Well, as everyone knows, Achilles does in fact reach and pass the tortoise — thus the paradox. The mathematics of infinite series explains how this infinite series of time intervals sums to a finite amount of time — the precise time when Achilles passes the tortoise. Here’s the sum for those who are curious: 1010 10 01 0 001sec. sec. .sec.. sec. .sec. .... . ... sec.,11 111 11 1 9 or seconds. Achilles passes the tortoise after 11 1 9 seconds at the 111 1 9 -yard mark. Infinite series problems are rich with bizarre, counterintuitive paradoxes. You see more of them in Unit 5. CHAPTER 3 Why Calculus Works 21 Why Calculus Works I n Chapters 1 and 2, I talk a lot about the process of zooming in on a curve till it looks straight. The mathematics of calculus works because of this basic nature of curves  — that they’re locally straight — in other words, curves are straight at the microscopic level. The earth is round, but to us it looks flat because we’re sort of at the microscopic level when compared to the size of the earth. Calculus works because after you zoom in and curves look straight, you can use regular algebra and geometry with them. The zooming-in process is achieved through the mathematics of limits. The Limit Concept: A Mathematical Microscope The mathematics of limits is the microscope that zooms in on a curve. Here’s how a limit works. Say you want the exact slope or steepness of the parabola y x 2 at the point 11, . See Figure 3-1. With the slope formula from algebra, you can figure the slope of the line between 11, and 2, 4 . From 11, to 2, 4 , you go over 1 and up 3, so the slope is 3 1 , or just 3. But you can see in Figure 3-1 that this line is steeper than the tangent line at 11, that shows the parabola’s steepness at that specific point. The limit process sort of lets you slide the point that starts at 2, 4 down toward 11, till it’s a thousandth of an inch away, then a millionth, then a billionth, and so on down to the microscopic level. If you do the math, the slopes between 11, and your moving point would look something like 2.8, then 2.6, then 2.4, and so on, and then, Chapter 3 IN THIS CHAPTER » Using limits to zoom in on curves » Slope equals rise over run » Area of a triangle equals one-half base times height » The Pythagorean Theorem: a bc 22 2 22 UNIT 1 An Overview of Calculus once you get to a thousandth of an inch away, 2.001, 2.000001, 2.000000001, and so on. And with the almost magical mathematics of limits, you can conclude that the slope at 11, is pre- cisely 2, even though the sliding point never reaches 11, . (If it did, you’d only have one point left and to use the slope formula, you need two separate points.) The mathematics of limits is all based on this zooming-in process, and it works, again, because the further you zoom in, the straighter the curve gets. What Happens When You Zoom In Figure 3-2 shows three diagrams of one curve and three things you might like to know about the curve: 1) the exact slope or steepness at point C, 2) the area under the curve between A and B, and 3) the exact length of the curve from A to B. You can’t answer these questions with regular algebra or geometry formulas because the regular formulas for slope, area, and length work for straight lines (and simple curves like circles), but not for weird curves like this one. The first row of Figure 3-3 shows a magnified detail from the three diagrams of the curve in Figure 3-2. The second row shows further magnification, and the third row yet another mag- nification. For each little window that gets blown up (like from the first to the second row of Figure 3-3), I’ve drawn in a new dotted diagonal line to help you see how with each magnifica- tion, the blown-up pieces of the curves get straighter and straighter. This process is continued indefinitely. Finally, Figure 3-4 shows the result after an “infinite” number of magnifications — sort of. After zooming in forever, an infinitely small piece of the original curve and the straight diag- onal line are now one and the same. You can think of the lengths 3 and 4 in Figure 3-4 (no pun intended) as 3 and 4 millionths of an inch; no, make that 3 and 4 billionths of an inch; no, trillionths; no, gazillionths. . . . FIGURE 3-1:  The parabola y x 2 with a tangent line at 11, . FIGURE 3-2:  One curve — three questions. CHAPTER 3 Why Calculus Works 23 Now that you’ve zoomed in “forever,” the curve is perfectly straight and you can use regular algebra and geometry formulas to answer the three questions about the curve in Figure 3-2. For the diagram on the left in Figure  3-4, you can now use the regular slope formula from algebra to find the slope at point C. It’s exactly 3 4  — that’s the answer to the first question in Figure 3-2. This is how differentiation works. For the diagram in the middle of Figure 3-4, the regular triangle formula from geometry gives you an area of 6. Then you can get the shaded area inside the strip shown in Figure  3-2 by adding this 6 to the area of the thin rectangle under the triangle (the dark-shaded rectangle FIGURE 3-3:  Zooming in to the microscopic level. FIGURE 3-4:  Your final destination — the sub, sub, sub subatomic level. 24 UNIT 1 An Overview of Calculus in Figure 3-2). Then you repeat this process for all the other narrow strips (not shown), and finally just add up all the little areas. This is how integration works. And for the diagram on the right of Figure 3-4, the Pythagorean Theorem from geometry gives you a length of 5. Then, to find the total length of the curve from A to B in Figure 3-2, you do the same thing for the other minute sections of the curve and then add up all the little lengths. This is how you calculate arc length (another integration problem). Well, there you have it. Calculus uses the limit process to zoom in on a curve till it’s straight. After it’s straight, the rules of regular-old algebra and geometry apply. Calculus thus gives ordinary algebra and geometry the power to handle complicated problems involving changing quantities (which on a graph show up as curves). This explains why calculus has so many prac- tical uses, because if there’s something you can count on — in addition to death and taxes — it’s that things are always changing. Two Caveats; or, Precision, Preschmidgen Not everything in this chapter (or this book for that matter) will satisfy the high standards of the Grand Poobah of Precision in Mathematical Writing. I may lose my license to practice mathematics With regard to the middle diagrams in Figures 3-2 through 3-4, I’m playing a bit fast and loose with the mathematics. The process of integration — finding the area under a curve — doesn’t exactly work the way I explained. My explanation isn’t really wrong, it’s just a bit sideways. But — I don’t care what anybody says — that’s my story and I’m stickin’ to it. Actually, it’s not a bad way to think about how integration works, and, anyhow, this is only an introductory chapter. What the heck does “infinity” really mean? The second caveat is that whenever I talk about infinity — like in the last section where I dis- cussed zooming in an infinite number of times — I do something like put the word “infinity” in quotes or say something like “you sort of zoom in forever.” I do this to cover my butt. Whenever you talk about infinity, you’re always on shaky ground. What would it mean to zoom in forever or an infinite number of times? You can’t do it; you’d never get there. You can imagine — sort of — what it’s like to zoom in forever, but there’s something a bit fishy about the idea — and thus the qualifications.2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites In This Unit . . .

Chapter 6 Quiz Answers to Chapter 6 Quiz CHAPTER 4 Pre-Algebra, Algebra, and Geometry Review 27 Pre-Algebra, Algebra, and Geometry Review A lgebra is the language of calculus. You can’t do calculus without knowing algebra any more than you can write Chinese poetry without knowing Chinese. So, if your pre- algebra and algebra are a bit rusty — you know, all those rules for algebraic expressions, equations, fractions, powers, roots, logs, factoring, quadratics, and so on  — make sure you review the following algebra basics. And you’ve got to review your basic geometry as well. Many calculus problems involve two- and three-dimensional shapes (triangles, rectangles, trapezoids, circles, boxes, cylinders, cones, spheres, and so on) and geometry concepts like length, area, and volume. The two big ideas of calculus are differentiation and integration. Differentiation involves finding the slope of a curve, and slope is a coordinate geometry concept. Integration involves finding the area under a curve. You can’t do calculus without a good grasp of basic geometry. Let’s get started. Chapter 4 IN THIS CHAPTER » Winning the fraction battle: Divide and conquer » Boosting your powers and getting to the root of roots » Laying down the laws of logarithms and having fun with factoring » Hanging around the quad solving quadratics » Getting in shape with two- and three-dimensional shapes » Getting it right with special right triangles 28 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites Fine-Tuning Your Fractions Many, many math students hate fractions. I’m not sure why, because there’s nothing especially difficult about them. Perhaps for some students, fraction concepts didn’t completely click when they first studied them, and then fractions became a nagging frustration whenever they came up in subsequent math courses. Whatever the cause, if you don’t like fractions, try to get over it, because you’ll have to deal with fractions in every math course you take. You can’t do calculus without a good grasp of fractions. Open a calculus book to any random page, and you’ll likely see a fraction. The very definition of the derivative is based on a fraction called the difference quotient. And, on top of that, the symbol for the derivative, dy dx , is a fraction. So, if you’re a bit rusty with fractions, get up to speed with the following problems — or else! Some quick rules First is a rule that’s simple but very important because it comes up time and time again in the study of calculus: You can’t divide by zero! The denominator of a fraction can never equal zero. 0 5 equals zero, but 5 0 is undefined. It’s easy to see why 5 0 is undefined when you consider how division works: 8 2 4 This tells you, of course, that 2 goes into 8 four times; in other words, 2 222 8. Well, how many zeros would you need to add up to make 5? You can’t do it, and so you can’t divide 5 (or any other number) by zero. Here’s another quick rule. Definition of reciprocal: The reciprocal of a number or expression is its multiplicative inverse — which is a fancy way of saying that the product of something and its reciprocal is 1. To get the reciprocal of a fraction, flip it upside down. Thus, the reciprocal of 3 4 is 4 3 , the reciprocal of 6, which equals 6 1, is 1 6, and the reciprocal of x 2 is 1 2x . Multiplying fractions Adding is usually easier than multiplying, but with fractions, the reverse is true — so I want to deal with multiplication first. CHAPTER 4 Pre-Algebra, Algebra, and Geometry Review 29 Multiplying fractions is a snap — just multiply straight across the top and straight across the bottom: 2 5 3 4 6 20 3 10 and a b c d ac bd Dividing fractions Dividing fractions has one additional step: You flip the second fraction and then multiply — like this: 3 10 4 5 3 10 5 4 15 40 (Now cancel a 5 from the numerator and deenominator.) 3 8 Note that you could have canceled before multiplying. Because 5 goes into 5 one time, and 5 goes into 10 two times, you can cancel a 5: 3 10 5 4 3 82 1 Also note that the original problem could have been written as 3 10 4 5 . Adding fractions You know that 2 7 3 7 23 7 5 7 You can add up these fractions like this because you already have a common denominator. It works the same with variables: a c b c ab c Notice that wherever you have a 2 in the top equation, an a is in the bottom equation; wherever a 3 is in the top equation, a b is in the bottom equation; and ditto for 7 and c. This illustrates a powerful principle: Variables always behave exactly like numbers. 30 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites If you’re wondering what to do with variables in a problem, ask yourself how you would do the problem if there were numbers in it instead of variables. Then do the problem with the vari- ables the same way, like this: a b c d You can’t add these fractions like you did in the previous example because this problem has no common denominator. Now, assuming you’re stumped, do the problem with numbers instead of variables. Remember how to add 2 5 3 8 ? I’m not going to simplify each line of the solution. You’ll see why in a minute. 1. Find the least common denominator (actually, any common denominator will work when adding fractions), and convert the fractions. The least common denominator is 5 times 8, or 40, so convert each fraction into 40ths: 2 5 3 8 2 5 8 8 3 8 5 5 28 58 35 58 85 58(equalsso you can reveerse the order. These fractions are thsbut I want to lea40 ,vve the in the denominators for now. 58 ) 2. Add the numerators and keep the common denominator unchanged: 28 35 58 16 15 40 31 40 You can see this equalsor,. Now you’re ready to do the original problem, a b c d . In this problem, you have an a instead of a 2, a b instead of a 5, a c instead of a 3, and a d instead of an 8. Just carry out the exact same steps as you do when adding 2 5 3 8 . You can think of each of the numbers in the solution as stamped on one side of a coin with the corresponding variable stamped on the other side. For instance, there’s a coin with a 2 on one side and an a on the opposite side; another coin has an 8 on one side and a d on the other side, and so on. Now, take each step of the previous solution, flip each coin over, and voilà, you’ve got the solution to the original problem. Here’s the final answer: ad cb bd Subtracting fractions Subtracting fractions works like adding fractions except instead of adding, you subtract. Insights like this are the reason they pay me the big bucks. CHAPTER 4 Pre-Algebra, Algebra, and Geometry Review 31 Canceling in fractions Finishing calculus problems — after you’ve done all the calculus steps — sometimes requires some pretty messy algebra, including canceling. Make sure you know how to cancel and when you can and can’t do it. In the fraction xy xz 52 3 , three x’s can be canceled from the numerator and denominator, resulting in the simplified fraction, xy z 22 . If you write out the x’s instead of using exponents, you can more clearly see how this works: xy xz x xxxx yy xxxz 52 3 Now cancel three x’s from the numerator and denominator: xxx xx yy xxx z That leaves you with xx yy z , or xy z 22 . Express yourself An algebraic expression or just expression is something like xyz or a pq 23 6, basically anything without an equal sign (if it has an equal sign, it’s an equation). Canceling works the same way with expressions as it does for single variables. By the way, that’s a tip not just for canceling, but for all algebra topics. Expressions behave exactly like variables. So, if each x in the preceding problem is replaced with xyzq , you’ve got xyzq y xyzq z 5 2 3 , and three instances of the expression xyzq cancel from the numerator and denominator, just as the three x’s canceled. The simplified result is xyzq y z 2 2 . The multiplication rule for canceling Now you know how to cancel. You also need to know when you can cancel. The multiplication rule: You can cancel in a fraction only when it has an unbroken chain of mul- tiplication through the entire numerator and the entire denominator. 32 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites Canceling is allowed in a fraction like this: ab xy pq cd ab zxypq 23 3 5 7 . Think of multiplication as something that conducts electricity. Electrical current can flow from one end of the numerator to the other, from the a 2 to the cd , because all the variables and expressions are connected with multiplication. (Note that an addition or subtraction sign inside parentheses — the “ ” in cd for instance — doesn’t break the flow of current.) Because the denominator also has an unbroken chain of multiplication, canceling is allowed. You can cancel one a, three b’s, and three of the expression xy pq . Here’s the result: axypqc d bz 2 4 When you can’t cancel: Adding an innocuous-looking 1 to the numerator (or denominator) of the original fraction changes everything: ab xy pq cd ab zxypq 23 3 5 7 1 The addition sign in front of the 1 breaks the flow of current, and no canceling is allowed any- where in the fraction. I should point out a situation that appears to violate the multiplication rule for canceling. You can cancel in a fraction like the following: 15 25 35 510 xy ab pq You can cancel a 5 out of all five terms, resulting in 35 7 2 xy ab pq This type of canceling is allowed only when you can cancel the same thing out of every term in the numerator and denominator. This problem appears to violate the multiplication rule, but it really doesn’t, because if you first factor the numerator and denominator like this — 53 57 52 xy ab pq CHAPTER 4 Pre-Algebra, Algebra, and Geometry Review 33 — you arrive at a fraction that does satisfy the multiplication rule, and you can then cancel the 5’s, producing the same answer. Q. Solve: ab dd abc 23 ? A. ac d 52 2 b . To multiply fractions, you just multiply straight across. You do not cross- multiply in a diagonal direction! And you do not use a common denominator! Q. Solve: 535 3a cdbc a ? A. 55 5 35 7 35 35 3 33 2 a bc cd a bc cd acd abc d ab a a . To divide fractions, you flip the second one, and then multiply. 1 Solve: 12 0 ? 2 Solve: 0 10 ? 3 Does 3 3 ab ac equal ab ac ? Why or why not? 4 Does 3 3 ab ac equal b c ? Why or why not? 5 Does 4 4 ab ac equal ab ac ? Why or why not? 34 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites 6 Does 4 4 ab ac equal b c ? Why or why not? Miscellaneous Algebra If I could have thought of a nice, mathematical term for the group of topics that follow, I would have used it. But I couldn’t. Hence, the oh-so-descriptive miscellaneous. Absolute value — absolutely easy Absolute value just turns a negative number into a positive and does nothing to a positive num- ber or zero. For example, 66 33 00,, and It’s a bit trickier when dealing with variables. If x is zero or positive, then the absolute value bars do nothing, and thus, xx But if x is negative, the absolute value of x is positive, and you write xx For example, if x 55 55, x can be a positive number. When x is a negative number, x (read as “negative x,” or “the opposite of x”) is a positive. Empowering your powers You are powerless in calculus if you don’t know the power rules: » x 0 1 This is the rule regardless of what x equals — a fraction, a negative, anything — except for zero (zero raised to the zero power is undefined). Let’s call it the kitchen sink rule (where the kitchen sink represents zero): everything but the kitchen sink 0 1 CHAPTER 4 Pre-Algebra, Algebra, and Geometry Review 35 » x x x x a a 3 3 11 and For example, 4 1 4 1 16 2 2 . This is huge! Don’t forget it! Note that the power is negative, but the answer of 1 16 is not negative. » xx xx xx ab b a ab23 2 233// and You can use this handy rule backwards to convert a root problem into an easier power problem. » xx xx xx ab ab23 5 and You add the powers here. (By the way, you can’t do anything to x 2 plus x 3. You can’t add x 2 to x 3 because they’re not like terms. You can only add or subtract terms when the variable part of each term is the same, for instance, 34 7 22 2xy zxyz xy z. This works for exactly the same reason — I’m not kidding — that 3 chairs plus 4 chairs is 7 chairs; and you can’t add unlike terms, just like you can’t add 5 chairs plus 2 cars.) » x x x x x x x x x a b ab 5 3 2 2 6 4 and and Here you subtract the powers. » xx xx a b ab2 3 6 and You multiply the powers here. » xyzx yz xyzx yz a aa a3 33 3 and Here you distribute the power to each variable. » x y x y x y x y a a a 4 4 4 and Here you also distribute the power to each variable. » xy xy 2 22. NOT! Do not distribute the power in this case. Instead, multiply it out the long way: xy xy xy xxyxyy xxyy 2 22 222 . Watch what happens if you erroneously use the preceding “law” with numbers: 35 2 equals 8 2, or 64, not 35 22, which equals 9 25, or 34. Rooting for roots Roots, especially square roots, come up all the time in calculus. So, knowing how they work and understanding the fundamental connection between roots and powers is essential. And, of course, that’s what I’m about to tell you. Roots rule — make that, root rules Any root can be converted into a power, for example, xx 3 13/ , xx 12/ , and xx 34 34/ . So, if you get a problem with roots in it, you can just convert each root into a power and use the power rules instead to solve the problem (this is a very useful technique). Because you have this 36 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites option, the following root rules are less important than the power rules, but you really should know them anyway: » 00 11 and But you knew that, right? No negatives under even roots. You can’t have a negative number under a square root or under any other even number root — at least not in basic calculus. » ab ab ab ab ab ab nn n ,, and 33 3 » a b a b a b a b a b a b n n n, 3 3 3 , and » aa aa nm mn43 12 and You multiply the root indexes. » aa aa aa 244 66 , ,, and so on. If you have an even number root, you need the absolute value bars on the answer, because whether a is positive or negative, the answer is positive. If it’s an odd number root, you don’t need the absolute value bars. Thus, » aa aa 33 55 ,, . and so on » ab ab 22 . NOT! Make this mistake and go directly to jail. Try solving it with numbers: 23 13 22 , which does not equal 2 3. Simplifying roots Here are two last things on roots. First, you need to know the two methods for simplifying roots like 300 or 504 . The quick method works for 300 because it’s easy to see a large perfect square, 100, that goes into 300. Because 300 equals 100 times 3, the 100 comes out as its square root, 10, leaving the 3 inside the square root. The answer is thus 10 3 . For 504 , it’s not as easy to find a large perfect square that goes into 504, so you’ve got to use the longer method: 1. Break 504 down into a product of all of its prime factors. 504 22 23 37 2. Circle each pair of numbers. 3. For each circled pair, take one number out. 2 32 7 CHAPTER 4 Pre-Algebra, Algebra, and Geometry Review 37 4. Simplify. 6 14 The last thing about roots is that, by convention, you don’t leave a root in the denominator of a fraction — it’s a silly, anachronistic convention, but it’s still being taught, so here it is. If your answer is, say, 2 3 , you multiply it by 3 3 : 2 3 3 3 23 3 Logarithms — this is not an event at a lumberjack competition A logarithm is just a different way of expressing an exponential relationship between numbers. For instance, 2 8 3 ,, so log 283 (read as “log base 2 of 8 equals 3”). These two equations say precisely the same thing. You could think of 2 8 3 as the way you write it in English and log 283 as the way you would write it in Latin. And because it’s easier to think and do math in English, make sure — when you see something like log 381 x — that you can instantly “translate” it into 381 x . The base of a logarithm can be any number greater than zero other than 1, and by convention, if the base is 10, you don’t write it. For example, log1000 3 means log101000 3. Also, log base e (e 272. ) is written ln instead of log e. You should know the following logarithm properties: » log c 10 » log c c 1 » log loglogcc cab ab » log loglogcc c a b ab » log logc b cab a » log log log a c c b b a With this property, you can compute something like log 3 20 on a calculator that only has log buttons for base 10 (the “log” button) and base e (the “ln” button) by entering log log 20 3 , using base 10 for c. On many newer-model calculators, you can compute log 3 20 directly. » log a bab » a b a blog 38 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites Factoring schmactoring — when am I ever going to need it? When are you ever going to need it? For calculus, that’s when. Factoring means “unmultiplying,” like rewriting 12 as 2 23. You won’t run across problems like that in calculus, however. For calculus, you need to be able to factor algebraic expressions, like factoring 510xy yz as 52yx z . Algebraic factoring always involves rewriting a sum (or difference) of terms as a product. What follows is a quick refresher course. Pulling out the greatest common factor The first step in factoring any type of expression is to pull out — in other words, factor out — the greatest thing that all of the terms have in common  — that’s the greatest common factor or GCF. For example, each of the three terms of 8 12 20 34 25 43xy xy xy z contains the factor 4 23xy , so it can be pulled out like this: 4 23 5 23 22xy xy yx z . Make sure you always look for a GCF to pull out before trying other factoring techniques. Looking for a pattern After pulling out the GCF if there is one, the next thing to do is to look for one of the following three patterns. The first pattern is huge; the next two are much less important. DIFFERENCE OF SQUARES Knowing how to factor the difference of squares is critical: a ba ba b 22 If you can rewrite something like 9 25 4x so that it looks like this that 22 , then you can use this factoring pattern. Here’s how: 9 25 35 42 2 2xx Now, because this that this that this that 22 , you can factor the problem: 35 3355 2 2 2 22xx x A difference of squares, a b 22, can be factored, but a sum of squares, a b 22, cannot be factored. In other words, a b 22, like the numbers 7 and 13, is prime — you can’t break it up. SUM AND DIFFERENCE OF CUBES You might also want to memorize the factor rules for the sum and difference of cubes: a ba ba ab b ab ab aabb 33 22 33 22 CHAPTER 4 Pre-Algebra, Algebra, and Geometry Review 39 Trying some trinomial factoring Remember regular old trinomial factoring from your algebra days? Several definitions: A trinomial is a polynomial with three terms. A polynomial is an expression like 4 65 2 53 2xx xx where, except for the constant (the 2 in this example), all the terms have a variable raised to a positive integral power. In other words, no fraction powers or nega- tive powers allowed (so, 1 x is not a polynomial because it equals x 1). And no radicals, no logs, no sines or cosines, or anything else — just terms with a coefficient, like the 4 in 4 5x , multiplied by a variable raised to a positive integral power. The degree of a polynomial is the polynomial’s highest power of x. The polynomial at the beginning of this paragraph, for instance, has a degree of 5. It wouldn’t be a bad idea to get back up to speed with problems like 6 13 52 53 1 2xx xx where you have to factor the trinomial on the left into the product of the two binomials on the right. A few standard techniques for factoring a trinomial like this are floating around the mathematical ether — you probably learned one or more of them in your algebra class. If you remember one of the techniques, great. You won’t have to do a lot of trinomial factoring in calculus, but it does come in handy now and then, so, if your skills are a bit rusty, check out Algebra II For Dummies, by Mary Jane Sterling (Wiley). Solving quadratic equations A quadratic equation is any second-degree polynomial equation  — that’s when the highest power of x, or whatever other variable is used, is 2. You can solve quadratic equations by one of three basic methods. Method 1: Factoring Solve 2 512 2xx . 1. Bring all terms to one side of the equation, leaving a zero on the other side. 2 5120 2xx 2. Factor. 23 40xx You can check that these factors are correct by multiplying them. Does FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) ring a bell? 40 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites 3. Set each factor equal to zero and solve (using the zero product property). 2 30 40 23 4 3 2 xx xx x or So, this equation has two solutions: x 3 2 and x 4. The discriminant tells you whether a quadratic is factorable. Method 1 works only if the qua- dratic is factorable. The quick test for that is a snap. A quadratic is factorable if the discrimi- nant, b ac 2 4 , is a perfect square number like 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and so on. (The discriminant is the stuff under the square root symbol in the quadratic formula — see Method 2 in the next section.) In the quadratic equation from Step 1, 2 5120 2xx , for example, a 2, b 5, and c 12; b ac 2 4 equals, therefore, 54 212 2 , which equals 121. Because 121 is a perfect square 11 2 , the quadratic is factorable. Because trinomial factoring is often so quick and easy, you may choose to just dive into the problem and try to factor it without bothering to check the value of the discriminant. But if you get stuck, it’s not a bad idea to check the discriminant so you don’t waste more time trying to factor an unfactorable quadratic trinomial. (But whether or not the quadratic is factorable, you can always solve it with the quadratic formula.) Method 2: The quadratic formula The solution or solutions of a quadratic equation, axbxc 2 0, are given by the quadratic formula: x bb ac a 2 4 2 Now solve the same equation from Method 1 with the quadratic formula: 1. Bring all terms to one side of the equation, leaving a zero on the other side. 2 5120 2xx 2. Plug the coefficients into the formula. In this example, a equals 2, b is 5, and c is 12, so x 55 42 12 22 52596 4 5 121 4 511 4 16 4 2 or or 6 4 4 3 2 x CHAPTER 4 Pre-Algebra, Algebra, and Geometry Review 41 This agrees with the solutions obtained previously — the solutions better be the same because you’re solving the same equation. Method 3: Completing the square The third method of solving quadratic equations is called completing the square because it involves creating a perfect square trinomial that you can solve by taking its square root. Solve 32427 2xx . 1. Put the x 2 and the x terms on one side and the constant on the other. 32427 2xx 2. Divide both sides by the coefficient of x 2 (unless, of course, it’s 1). xx 2 89 3. Take half of the coefficient of x, square it, then add that to both sides. Half of 8 is 4 and 4 2 is 16, so add 16 to both sides: xx 2 8169 16 4. Factor the left side into a binomial squared. Notice that the factor always contains the same number you found in Step 3 (–4 in this example). x 425 2 5. Take the square root of both sides, remembering to put a sign on the right side. x x 425 45 2 6. Solve. x x 45 91 or Q. Factor 9 46xy . A. 9 33 46 23 23xy xy xy . This is an example of the single most important factor pattern: a ba ba b 22 . Make sure you know it! In this problem, 3 2x is your a and y 3 is your b. That’s all there is to it. Q. Rewrite x 25 without a fraction power. A. x 25 or x 5 2 . Don’t forget how fraction powers work! 42 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites 7 Rewrite x 3 without a negative power. 8 Does abc 4 equal a bc 44 4?

Why or why not? 12 Rewrite log a bc as an exponential equation. 13 Rewrite log logccab with a single log. 14 Rewrite log log5 200 with a single log and then solve.

Geometry Refresher You can use calculus to solve many real-world problems that involve two- or three- dimensional shapes and various curves, surfaces, and volumes — such as calculating the rate at which the water level is falling in a cone-shaped tank or determining the dimensions that maximize the volume of a cylindrical soup can. So the geometry formulas for perimeter, area, volume, surface area, and so on will come in handy. You should also know things like the Pythagorean Theorem, proportional shapes, and basic coordinate geometry, like the mid- point and distance formulas. Finally, make sure you know your 454590 and 30 60 90 triangles. 44 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites Handy-dandy geometry formulas The following formulas might come in handy in your calculus studies.

CHAPTER 4 Pre-Algebra, Algebra, and Geometry Review 45 Two special right triangles Because so many garden-variety calculus problems involve 30-, 45-, and 60-degree angles, it’s a good idea to memorize the two right triangles in Figure 4-1. The 45° − 45° − 90° triangle Every 454590 triangle is the shape of a square cut in half along its diagonal. The 454590 triangle in Figure 4-1 is half of a 1-by-1 square. The Pythagorean Theorem gives you the length of its hypotenuse, 2 , or about 1.41. The 30° − 60° − 90° triangle Every 30 60 90 triangle is half of an equilateral triangle cut straight down the middle along its altitude. The 30 60 90 triangle in Figure 4-1 is half of a 2-by-2-by-2 equilateral triangle. It has legs of lengths 1 and 3 (about 1.73), and a 2-unit-long hypotenuse. Don’t make the common error of switching the 2 with the 3 in a 306090 triangle. Remember that 2 is more than 3 ( 4 equals 2, so 3 be must be less than 2) and that the hypotenuse is always the longest side of a right triangle. When you sketch a 306090 triangle, exaggerate the fact that it’s wider than it is tall (or taller than wide if you tip it up). This makes it obvious that the shortest side (length of 1) is opposite the smallest angle (30 ). Q. What’s the area of the triangle in the following figure?

Don’t mix this up with something like 0 8 , which equals zero. Here’s a great way to think about this problem and fractions in general. Consider the follow- ing simple division or fraction problem: 8 2 4. Note the multiplication problem implicit here: 2 times 4 is 8. This multiplication idea is a great way to think about how fractions work. So in the current problem, you can consider 12 0 ____, and use the multiplication idea: 0 times ____ equals 12. What works in the blank? Nothing, obviously, because 0 times anything is 0. The answer, therefore, is undefined. Note that if you think about these two fractions as examples of slope rise run , 12 0 has a rise of 12 and a run of 0, which gives you a vertical line that has sort of an infinite steepness or slope (that’s why it’s undefined). Or just remember that it’s impossible to drive up a vertical road, so it’s impossible to come up with a slope for a vertical line. The fraction 0 8 , on the other hand, has a rise of 0 and a run of 8, which gives you a horizontal line that has no steepness at all and thus has the perfectly ordinary slope of zero. Of course, it’s also perfectly ordinary to drive on a horizontal road. 2 0 10 0. (See the solution to Problem 1 for more information.) 3 No. You can’t cancel the 3’s. You can’t cancel in a fraction unless there’s an unbroken chain of multiplication running across the entire numerator and the entire denominator. 4 No, they’re not equal. You can’t cancel the 3a’s. (See the warning in Problem 3.) You can also just test this problem with numbers: Does 34 5 34 6 5 6 ? No, they’re not equal. 5 Yes, they’re equal. You can cancel the 4’s because the entire numerator and the entire denominator are connected with multiplication. 6 Yes, they’re equal. You can cancel the 4a’s. 7 1 3x . 8 Yes. Exponents do distribute over multiplication. 9 No! Exponents do not distribute over addition (or subtraction). Use numbers instead of variables! When you’re working a problem and can’t remember the algebra rule, try the problem with numbers instead of variables. Just replace the variables with simple, round numbers and work out the numerical problem. (Don’t use 0, 1, or 2 because they have special properties that can mess up your test.) Whatever works for the CHAPTER 4 Pre-Algebra, Algebra, and Geometry Review 53 numbers will work with variables, and whatever doesn’t work with numbers won’t work with variables. Watch what happens if you try this problem with numbers: 34 63 46 13 81 256 1296 28 561 1633 4 44 4 4 ? ? , 10 x 12 . 11 No! The explanation is basically the same as for Problem 9. Consider this: If you turn the root into a power, you get ab ab 22 22 12/ . But because you can’t distribute the power over addition, ab ab 22 12 2 12 2 12// / , or a b , and thus ab ab 22 . 12 a b c . 13 log c a b . 14 loglog loglog5 200 5 200 1000 3. When you see “log” without a base number, the base is 10. 15 x 8 5 1or . Start by rearranging 53 8 2xx into 53 80 2xx because when solving a quadratic equa- tion, you want just a zero on one side of the equation. The quadratic formula tells you that x bb ac a 2 4 2 . Plugging 5 into a, –3 into b, and –8 into c gives you x 33 45 8 25 39 160 10 313 10 16 10 2 or 10 10 , so x 8 5 or –1. 16 x xorx x 16 3 4 16 3 4,, . 1. Turn the inequality into an equation: 32 14x 2. Solve the absolute value equation. 32 14 312 4 x x x or 32 14 316 16 3 x x x 3. Place both solutions on a number line (see the following figure). (You use hollow dots for > and <; if the problem had involved or , you would use solid dots.) 54 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites 4. Test a number from each of the three regions on the line (left of the left dot, between the dots, and right of the right dot) in the original inequality. For this problem, you can use –10, 0, and 10. 3102 14 28 14 28 14 ? ? ? True, so you shade the left-most region. 30 214 214 ? ? False, so you don’t shade the middle region. 3102 14 32 14 32 14 ? ? ? True, so you shade the region on the right. The following figure shows the result. x can be any number where the line is shaded. That’s your final answer. 5. You may also want to express the answer symbolically. Because x can equal a number in the left region or a number in the right region, this is an or solution, which means union (∪). When you want to include everything from both regions on the number line, you want the union of the two regions. So, the symbolic answer is xx 16 3 4 (You can write this using the word “or” instead of the union symbol.) If only the middle region were shaded, you’d have an and or intersection problem (∩). Using the number line points in this example, you would write the middle-region solution like this: xx 16 3 4 (You can use the word “and” instead of the intersection symbol.) Note that in this solution (whether you use “and” or the intersection symbol), the two inequalities CHAPTER 4 Pre-Algebra, Algebra, and Geometry Review 55 overlap or intersect in the middle region. You can avoid the intersection issue by simply writing the solution as 16 3 4x You say “to-may-to,” I say “to-mah-to.” 17 The answer is –12. Funny-looking problem, eh? It’s just meant to help you review a few basics. Take a look at the six terms: Don’t forget, 39 2 . If you want to square a negative number, you have to put it in paren- theses: 39 2 . Next, anything to the zero power (including a variable) equals 1. That takes care of the second and fifth chunks of the problem. The square root of zero is just zero, of course, because zero squared equals zero. And you know that the absolute value of –1 is 1; you just have to be careful not to goof up with all those negative signs and subtraction signs. Finally, zero to any positive power equals zero. That does it: 30 11 0 91 01 10 12 20 01x 18 The answer is p q 25. Most people prefer working with power rules to working with root rules, so that’s the way I solve the problem here. First, rewrite the root as a power: pq pq 6153 615 13/ . Now, just distribute the power to the p 6 and the q 6, and then use the power-to-a-power rule: pq pq pq pq 615 13 6 13 15 13 61 3151 3 25 / // // 19 The answer is 81 16. I’ll give you the longer version of the solution and then show you a shortcut. First, use the definition of a negative exponent to rewrite the problem as 1 8 27 43/ . Next, change the power to a root: 1 8 27 3 4 (instead, you could first distribute the fraction power to the numerator and denominator). The rest shouldn’t be too bad: 1 8 27 1 8 27 1 2 3 1 16 81 81 16 3 4 3 3 44 . The shortcut is to use the fact that when you have a fraction raised to a negative power, you can flip the fraction and make the power positive, like this 8 27 27 8 43 43// . Then proceed as follows: 27 8 27 8 27 8 3 2 81 16 43 43 43 3 4 3 4 4 4 / / / . 56 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites 20 44 55xx . To factor x 10 16, you use the oh-so-important a b 22 rule. a b 22 factors into ab ab . Make sure you know this factoring rule (and the corresponding FOILing rule, which is the fac- toring rule in reverse). Whenever you see a binomial with a subtraction sign (in the current problem, you have to switch the two terms to see the subtraction sign), ask yourself whether you can rewrite the binomial as 22 , in other words, as something squared minus something else squared. If you can, then the first blank is your a, and the second blank is your b. The binomial in this problem can be rewritten as 4 2 5 2 x . Now just plug the 4 into the a and the x 5 into the b in ab ab , and you’re done. 21 a 5 and b 53 . This is a 30 60 90 triangle. 22 Another 30 60 90 triangle. a b 8 3 83 3 16 3 16 3 3 or or 23 a 6 and b 62 . Make sure you know your 454590 triangle. 24 a. The total area of the pentagon is 50 25 3 2 . The square is 10 2 by 10 2 (because half a square is a 454590 triangle), so the area is 10 2 10 2 100 2 50. The equilateral triangle has a base of 10 2 , or 52 , so its height is 56 2 (because half of an equilateral triangle is a 30 60 90 triangle). So, the area of the triangle is 1 2 52 56 2 25 12 4 50 3 4 25 3 2 . The total area is thus 50 25 3 2 . b. The perimeter is 25 2. The sides of the square are 10 2 , or 52 , as are the sides of the equilateral triangle. The pentagon has five sides, so the perimeter is 55 2 , or 252. 25 The answer is 20 2 . The height of the parallelogram is 4 2 , or 2 2, because its height is one of the legs of a 454590 triangle. The parallelogram’s base is 10. So, because the area of a parallelogram equals base times height, the area is 10 22 , or 202 . 26 db ca . Remember that slope rise run yy xx 21 21 . 27 ca db 22 .

CHAPTER 4 Pre-Algebra, Algebra, and Geometry Review 57 29 23 . There are a few ways to solve this problem, all of which use your knowledge of 30 60 90 triangles. Here’s a quick and easy way. Triangle ABC is a 30 60 90 triangle, and the short leg of a 30 60 90 triangle is half as long as its hypotenuse, so BC is 4. Triangle BCD is another 30 60 90 triangle, so its short leg is half as long as its hypotenuse. That gives DC a length of 2. Then, because BD is the long leg of 30 60 90 triangle BCD, it’s 3 times its short leg. That gives you the answer of 2 3 , for altitude BD. 30 6 +6 3. Triangle ABD is yet another 30 60 90 triangle, so its hypotenuse is twice as long as its short leg, BD. That gives you a length of 4 3 for AB. Next, AD is 8 2, or 6. The perimeter of triangle ABD is therefore 6 23 43 , or 6 63 . 31 27 +9 3 . Piece o’ cake. Begin with triangle QRS, which you can see is a 454590 triangle. The legs of a 454590 triangle are equal, so QR is 6, and the hypotenuse of a 454590 trian- gle is 2 times either leg, so QS is 6 2 . Now you see that the hypotenuse of triangle TQS is twice as long as its short leg, QT , which tells you that triangle TQS is a 30 60 90 triangle. That makes TQS 60 , and you also get the length of TS, which, because it’s the long leg of 30 60 90 triangle TQS, has to be 3 times as long as its short leg, QT . So TS is 36 . Next, because PQR is 150 , and angles TQS and SQR are 60 and 45 , respectively, you sub- tract to get 45 for PQT . That makes triangle PQT a 454590 triangle, and thus PT , like QT , is 32 . Now you have everything you need to figure the area of the quadrilateral. The area of a right triangle equals half the product of its legs, so here’s the final math: Area area area areaQuad PQRS PQTTQS QRS 1 2 32 32 1 2 36 3 22 1 2 66 9 1 2 91218 99 318 27 93 Make sure you know your 30 60 90 and 454590 triangles! 32 10 1 3 . To do this problem and the next one, you first have to establish that the two triangles are similar (the same shape). Because segments BD and AE are parallel, angles BDC and AED are corresponding angles and are therefore congruent. And the two triangles share angle C. Thus, by the AA (angle-angle) theorem, triangles BCD and ACE are similar. To get the length of BC , you could use similar triangle proportions, but it’s a little bit quicker to use the side-splitter theorem, which tells you that BC AB 4 8 . Because the ratio equals 4 8 , you can set BC equal to 4x and AB equal to 8x. They add up to 13, so you have 4 813xx , or x 13 12. Plugging that into 4x gives you 13 3 for the length of BC . 58 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites Now all you need to finish is the length of BD. Did you fall for the nasty trap in this problem? When you see the 4 and the 8 along the right side of triangle ACE, it’s easy to make the mis- take of thinking that BD and AE will be in the same 4-to-8 or 1-to-2 ratio and conclude that BD therefore equals 3. But BD and AE are not in a 1-to-2 ratio. To get BD, you have to use a similar triangle proportion like the following: right side of right side of base of base of BCD ACE BCD AACE CD CE BD AE BD4 12 6 Cross multiplication gives you a length of 2 for BD. Adding up the three sides (4, 13 3 , and 2) gives you the perimeter. 33 1 9 or 1: 9. If you know the appropriate theorem for this problem, it’s a snap. If you don’t know the theorem, the problem’s very hard. You could also get tripped up if you thought you needed the areas of the two triangles (you don’t), and you could be thrown off by the trap referred to in Problem 32. All you need is the theorem that tells you that the ratio of the areas of similar figures is equal to the square of the ratio of any of their corresponding sides. For this problem, the theorem tells you that Area Area CD CE BCD ACE 22 24 12 1 3 1 9 . (Note that you did not need to know the altitudes of the triangles or their areas in order to compute the ratio of their areas.) In plain English, the idea is simply that if you take any 2-D shape and blow it up to, say, 4 times its height, its area will grow 4 2, or 16 times. By the way, if you blow up a 3-D shape, say, 4 times its height, its volume will grow 4 3, or 64 times. 34 3 2 xy. When you see a 60 angle in a problem, one of the first things you should consider is the 30 60 90 triangle. Sure enough, that’s the key to this problem. All you need to do is to drop an altitude from Q straight down to base PS , making a right angle with PS . Call the point where the altitude meets the base point T. Triangle PQT contains a 60 angle and a 90 angle, so it has to be a 30 60 90 triangle. The short leg of a 30 60 90 triangle is half as long as its hypotenuse, so PT is half of PQ, or 1 2 y . Then, because the long leg of a 30 60 90 triangle is 3 times as long as its short leg, altitude QT is 3 1 2 3 2 yy . Now that you have the altitude and the base of the parallelogram, you just plug them into the parallelogram area formula to get your answer: Area base height xyparallelogram PQRS 3 2 .

The best way to solve an absolute value inequality is to solve the related equation and then test the regions on the number line created by the solutions to the equation. x 3 44 x x x 3 3 44 0 0 or x x x 3 3 44 8 2 The solutions of –2 and 0 create three regions on the number line: one to the left of –2, one between –2 and 0, and one to the right of 0. Take one number (any number) from each of the three regions and test them one at a time in the original inequality. Only the middle region produces a true result, so your answer is 20x . 10 1 x . First, flip the fraction and make the –2 power positive: xx xx x 16 512 12 13 14 2. Multiply out the numerator and denominator by adding the powers: xx xx x x x 2125 12 6124 12 312 2 712 13 12 2. Subtract the powers in the numerator and denominator: xx x x 612 2 12 2 1 1 11 x xx01 1or or . The first step is optional, but many people find it easier to work with powers than with roots, so you can rewrite the equations using powers: xx 13 15. Now, to get rid of those pesky fractions, raise both sides of the equation to the 15th power (because 15 is the least common multiple of 3 and 5): xx xx xx xx xx x 13 15 15 15 53 53 32 3 0 10 11 0, and sso on CHAPTER 4 Pre-Algebra, Algebra, and Geometry Review 63 12 1. First, rewrite without fractions or roots: lnlog loglog loge 2 82 1312 810 . The first and last of these terms should be automatic if you know the definition of a logarithm.

Keep your eyes peeled for such problems when you see a trino- mial like this. Whenever the first term (ignoring any coefficient) is the square of the middle term (ignoring any coefficient) — as here, where xx 12 14 2  — you’ve got a disguised qua- dratic. If you set u x 14, then u x 21 2. Now just rewrite the original equation in terms of u, factor, and solve for u: uu uu 2 56 0 23 0 Thus, u 2 or u 3. But don’t forget: you want x, not u, so you’ve got to switch back to x and then solve for x. x x 14 2 16 or x x 14 3 81 14 x x 15 2 15 2 or . Multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator, namely, x 3, then set the resulting quadratic equation equal to zero: x x xx x xx xx 3 23 3 2 2 11 1 1 10 You can’t factor this because the discriminant (b ac 2 4 ) equals 5, which is not a perfect square.

If you found two, not too bad. Congrats if you found all four. Let’s first find the highest and lowest points. The highest point C on the line will make B a right angle. A right angle means that you’ve got perpendicular lines, and perpendicular lines have opposite reciprocal slopes. Thus, the slope of CB will have to equal the opposite recipro- cal of the slope of AB, which equals 3 4 . The opposite reciprocal of that is 4 3 , so set the slope of CB equal to 4 3 and solve: y 8 812 4 3 ,. etc y 40 3 The solution for the lowest point C works the same way except that this time, the right angle will be A. When you do the math, you get y 10 3 . For the final two solutions (which I’m guessing were a bit harder to find), it’s C that will be the right angle. Thus, the slope of CA, y 2 84 , will have to equal the opposite reciprocal of the slope of CB, y 8 812 : y y yy yy yy yy 2 84 812 8 28 16 10 16 16 10 0 10 2 2 00 Your final two solutions for y are 0 and 10. 17 164 3 .

Next, set the volume of the sphere equal to that answer, and solve for r: 4 3 4 3 416 16 3 3 32 3 r r r Finally, use that value of r to determine the surface area of the sphere: SurfaceArearSphere 44 16 4164 4164 2 3 2 23 43 3 CHAPTER 4 Pre-Algebra, Algebra, and Geometry Review 65 18 6 53 6. . Note that XBA and XYZ are 30 60 90 triangles. XAB is thus a 60 angle, and, there- fore, BAC is 45 , and ABC is thus a 454590 triangle. It’s then easy to see that BCY is another 454590 triangle. Next, XB is the long leg of a 30 60 90 triangle, so it’s 3 times the length of the short leg, which is 2 3 . XB is therefore 32 3 , or 6. The next thing you need is BY so you can add that to XB to get base XY . Because AB is the hypotenuse of a 454590 triangle, you divide its length by 2 to get the length of BC . But then you have to divide that answer by 2 to get BY . Dividing by 2 twice is the same thing as dividing by 2, so that means that BY is half of AB. BY is thus 3 , and therefore XY is 6 3 . We’re almost done. Phew. So, XYZ (a 30 60 90 triangle) has a long leg of 6 3 . You divide that by 3 to get the length of the short leg, YZ . That short leg, which is the height of XYZ , is thus 63 3 , which simplifies to 2 31. Finally, you finish with the formula for the area of a triangle. The area of XYZ equals 1 2 base height, or 1 2 63 23 1 1 2 12 36 63 1 2 13 312 6 53 6. . Was that fun or what? CHAPTER 5 Funky Functions and Their Groovy Graphs 67 Funky Functions and Their Groovy Graphs I n Chapter 5, you continue your pre-calc warm-up that you began in Chapter 4. If algebra is the language calculus is written in, you might think of functions as the “sentences” of cal- culus. And they’re as important to calculus as sentences are to writing. Virtually everything you do in calculus concerns functions and their graphs in one way or another. Differential cal- culus involves finding the slope or steepness of various functions, and integral calculus involves computing the area underneath functions. And not only is the concept of a function critical for calculus, but it’s also one of the most fundamental ideas in all of mathematics. What Is a Function? Basically, a function is a relationship between two things in which the numerical value of one thing in some way depends on the value of the other. Examples are all around us: The average daily temperature for your city depends on, and is a function of, the time of year; the distance an object has fallen is a function of how much time has elapsed since you dropped it; the area of a circle is a function of its radius; and the pressure of an enclosed gas is a function of its temperature. Chapter 5 IN THIS CHAPTER » Figuring out functions and relations » Learning about lines » Getting particular about parabolas » Grappling with graphs » Transforming functions and investigating inverse functions 68 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites The defining characteristic of a function A function has only one output for each input. Consider Figure 5-1. The soda machine is a function because after plugging in the inputs (your choice and your money), you know exactly what the output is. With the slot machine, on the other hand, the output is a mystery, so it’s not a function. Look at Figure 5-2. The squaring function, f, is a function because it has exactly one output assigned to each input. It doesn’t matter that both 2 and −2 produce the same output of 4 because given an input, say −2, there’s no mystery about the output. When you input 3 into g, however, you don’t know whether the output is 1 or 2. (For now, don’t worry about how the g rule turns its inputs into its outputs.) Because no output mysteries are allowed in functions, g is not a function. Good functions, unlike good literature, have predictable endings. Definitions of domain and range: The set of all inputs of a function is called the domain of the function; the set of all outputs is the range of the function. FIGURE 5-1:  The soda machine is a function. The slot machine is not. FIGURE 5-2:  f is a function; g is not. CHAPTER 5 Funky Functions and Their Groovy Graphs 69 Some people like to think of a function as a machine. Consider again the squaring function, f, from Figure 5-2. Figure 5-3 shows two of the inputs and their respective outputs. You pop a 1 into the function machine, and out pops a 1; you put in a −2 and a 4 comes out. A function machine takes an input, operates on it in some way, and then spits out the output. Independent and dependent variables Definitions of dependent variable and independent variable: In a function, the thing that depends on the other thing is called the dependent variable; the other thing is the independent variable. Because you plug numbers into the independent variable, it’s also called the input variable. After plugging in a number, you then calculate the output or answer for the dependent variable, so the dependent variable is also called the output variable. When you graph a function, the inde- pendent variable goes on the x-axis, and the dependent variable goes on the y-axis. Sometimes the dependence between the two things is one of cause and effect — for example, raising the temperature of a gas causes an increase in the pressure. In this case, temperature is the independent variable and pressure the dependent variable because the pressure depends on the temperature. Often, however, the dependence is not one of cause and effect, but just some sort of associa- tion between the two things. Usually, though, the independent variable is the thing you already know or can easily ascertain, and the dependent variable is the thing you want to figure out. For instance, you wouldn’t say that time causes an object to fall (gravity is the cause), but if you know how much time has passed since you dropped an object, you can figure out how far it has fallen. So, time is the independent variable, and distance fallen is the dependent variable; and you would say that distance is a function of time. Whatever the type of correspondence between the two variables, the dependent variable (the y-variable) is the thing you’re usually more interested in. Generally, you want to know what happens to the dependent or y-variable as the independent or x-variable goes to the right: Is the y-variable (the height of the graph) rising or falling and, if so, how steeply, or is the graph level, neither going up nor down? Function notation A common way of writing the function y xx52 3 32 is to replace the “y” with “fx ” and write fx xx52 3 32 . It’s just a different notation for the same thing. These two equations are, in every respect, mathematically identical. Students are often puzzled by function nota- tion when they see it for the first time. They wonder what the “f” is and whether fx means f times x. It does not. If function notation bugs you, my advice is to think of fx as simply the way y is written in some foreign language. Don’t consider the f and the x separately; just think of fx as a single symbol for y. FIGURE 5-3:  A function machine: Meat goes in, sausage comes out. 70 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites You can also think of fx (read as “f of x”) as short for “a function of x.” You can write y fx x3 2, which is translated as “y is a function of x and that function is 3 2x .” However, sometimes other letters are used instead of f — such as gx or px   — often just to dif- ferentiate between functions. The function letter doesn’t necessarily stand for anything, but sometimes the initial letter of a word is used (in which case you use an uppercase letter). For instance, you know that the area of a square is determined by squaring the length of its side: Area side 2 or As 2. The area of a square depends on, and is a function of, the length of its side. With function notation, you can write As s 2. (Quick quiz: How does fx x 2 differ from the area of a square function, As s 2 ? Answer: For fx x 2, x can equal any number, but with As s 2, s must be positive, because the length of a side of a square cannot be negative or zero. The two functions thus have different domains.) Consider, again, the squaring function y x 2 or fx x 2. When you input 3 for x, the output is 9. Function notation is convenient because you can concisely express the input and the output by writing f 39 (read as “f of 3 equals 9”). Remember that f 39 means that when x is 3, f 3 is 9; or, equivalently, it tells you that when x is 3, y is 9. Composite functions A composite function is the combination of two functions. For example, the cost of the electrical energy needed to air-condition your place depends on how much electricity you use, and usage depends on the outdoor temperature. Because cost depends on usage and usage depends on temperature, cost depends on temperature. In function language, cost is a function of usage, usage is a function of temperature, and thus cost is a function of temperature. This last func- tion, a combination of the first two, is a composite function. Let fx x 2 and gx x58. Input 3 into gx g: 35 38, which equals 7. Now take that output, 7, and plug it into fx f: 77 49 2 . The machine metaphor shows what I did here. Look at Figure 5-4. The g machine turns the 3 into a 7, and then the f machine turns the 7 into a 49. You can express the net result of the two functions in one step with the following composite function: fg 349 You always calculate the inside function of a composite function first: g 37. Then you take the output, 7, and calculate f 7 , which equals 49. FIGURE 5-4:  Two function machines. CHAPTER 5 Funky Functions and Their Groovy Graphs 71 To determine the general composite function, fg x , plug gx , which equals 58x , into fx . In other words, you want to determine fx58 . The f function or f machine takes an input and squares it. Thus, fx x xx xx x xx 58 58 58 58 25 40 40 64 25 80 64 2 2 2 Thus, fg xx x25 80 64 2 . With composite functions, the order matters. As a general rule, fg xg fx . What Does a Function Look Like? I’m no math historian, but everyone seems to agree that René Descartes (1596–1650) came up with the x-y coordinate system shown in Figure 5-5. Isaac Newton (1642–1727) and Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716) are credited with inventing calculus, but it’s hard to imagine that they could have done it without Descartes’s contribu- tion several decades earlier. Think of the coordinate system (or the screen on your graphing calculator) as your window into the world of calculus. Virtually everything in your calculus textbook and in this book involves (directly or indirectly) the graphs of lines or curves  — usually functions — in the x-y coordinate system. Consider the four graphs in Figure 5-6. These four curves are functions because they satisfy the vertical line test. (Note: I’m using the term curve here to refer to any shape, whether it’s curved or straight.) The vertical line test: A curve is a function if a vertical line drawn through the curve  — regardless of where it’s drawn — touches the curve only once. This guarantees that each input within the function’s domain has exactly one output. FIGURE 5-5:  The Cartesian (for Descartes) or x-y coordinate system. 72 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites No matter where you draw a vertical line on any of the four graphs in Figure 5-6, the line will touch the curve at only one point. Try it. If, however, a vertical line can be drawn so that it touches a curve two or more times, then the curve is not a function. The two curves in Figure 5-7, for example, are not functions. FIGURE 5-6:  Four functions. FIGURE 5-7:  These two curves are not functions because they fail the vertical line test. They are, however, relations. CHAPTER 5 Funky Functions and Their Groovy Graphs 73 So, the four curves in Figure 5-6 are functions, and the two in Figure 5-7 are not, but all six of the curves are relations. Definition of relation: A relation is any collection of points on the x-y coordinate system. You spend a little time studying some non-function relations in calculus  — circles, for instance — but the vast majority of calculus problems involve functions. Q.

Lines in the plane in plain English A line is the simplest function you can graph on the coordinate plane. (Lines are important in calculus because you often study lines that are tangent to curves and because when you zoom in far enough on a curve, it looks and behaves like a line.) Figure 5-8 shows an example of a line: y x35. 3 For the function fx x 2, what’s fa bf ab ? FIGURE 5-8:  The graph of the line y x35. CHAPTER 5 Funky Functions and Their Groovy Graphs 75 Hitting the slopes The most important thing about the line in Figure 5-8 — at least for your study of calculus — is its slope or steepness. Notice that whenever x goes 1 to the right, y goes up by 3. A good way to visualize slope is to draw a stairway under the line (see Figure 5-9). The vertical part of the step is called the rise, the horizontal part is called the run, and the slope is defined as the ratio of the rise to the run: Slope rise run 3 1 3 You don’t have to make the run equal to 1. The ratio of rise to run, and thus the slope, always comes out the same, regardless of what size you make the steps. If you make the run equal to 1, however, the slope is the same as the rise because a number divided by 1 equals itself. This is a good way to think about slope — the slope is the amount that a line goes up (or down) as it goes 1 to the right. Definitions of positive, negative, zero, and undefined slopes: Lines that go up to the right have a positive slope; lines that go down to the right have a negative slope. Horizontal lines have a slope of zero, and vertical lines do not have a slope — you say that the slope of a vertical line is undefined. Here’s the formula for slope: Slope yy xx 21 21 FIGURE 5-9:  The line y x35 has a slope of 3. 76 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites Pick any two points on the line in Figure 5-9, say 18, and 314, , and plug them into the formula to calculate the slope: Slope 14 8 31 6 2 3 This computation involves, in a sense, a stairway step that goes over 2 and up 6. The answer of 3 agrees with the slope you can see in Figure 5-9. Any line parallel to this one has the same slope, and any line perpendicular to this one has a slope of 1 3 , which is the opposite reciprocal of 3. Parallel lines have the same slope. Perpendicular lines have opposite reciprocal slopes. Graphing lines If you have the equation of the line, y x35, but not its graph, you can graph the line the old-fashioned way or with your graphing calculator. The old-fashioned way is to create a table of values by plugging numbers into x and calculating y. If you plug 0 into x, y equals 5; plug 1 into x, and y equals 8; plug 2 into x, and y is 11, and so on. Table 5-1 shows the results. Table 5-1 Points on the Line y = 3x + 5 Plot the points, connect the dots, and put arrows on both ends — there’s your line. This is a snap with a graphing calculator. Just enter y x35 and your calculator graphs the line and produces a table like Table 5-1. Slope-intercept and point-slope forms You can see that the line in Figure 5-9 crosses the y-axis at 5 — this point is the y-intercept of the line. Because both the slope of 3 and the y-intercept of 5 appear in the equation y x35, this equation is said to be in slope-intercept form. Here’s the form written in the general way. Slope-intercept form: y mx b (Where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.) (If that doesn’t ring a bell — even a distant, faint bell — go directly to the registrar and drop calculus, but do not under any circumstances return this book.) Using the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line is another way to graph the line. For example, to graph the line discussed here, y x35, just start at 05, , the y-intercept, and then use the slope of 3 to go over 1 and up 3 from 05, to get to 1, 8 . Those two points give you your line. CHAPTER 5 Funky Functions and Their Groovy Graphs 77 All lines, except for vertical lines, can be written in slope-intercept form. Vertical lines are written like x 6, for example. The number tells you where the vertical line crosses the x-axis. The equation of a horizontal line also looks different, y 10 for example. But it technically fits the form y mx b — it’s just that because the slope of a horizontal line is zero, and because zero times x is zero, there is no x-term in the equation. (But, if you felt like it, you could write y 10 as y x010.) Definition of a constant function: A line is the simplest type of function, and a horizontal line (called a constant function) is the simplest type of line. It’s nonetheless fairly important in calculus, so make sure you know that a horizontal line has an equation like y 10 and that its slope is zero. If m 1 and b 0, you get the function y x. This line goes through the origin 0, 0 and makes a 45 angle with both coordinate axes. It’s called the identity function because its outputs are the same as its inputs. Point-slope form: In addition to the slope-intercept form for the equation of a line, you should also know the point-slope form: y ym xx11 To use this form, you need to know — you guessed it — a point on a line and the line’s slope. You can use any point on the line. Consider the line in Figure 5-9 again. Pick any point, say 211, , and then plug the x- and y-coordinates of the point into x1 and y1, and plug the slope, 3, into m: y x11 32 With a little algebra, you can convert this equation into the one you already know, y x35. Try it. Parabolic and absolute value functions — even-steven You should be familiar with the two functions shown in Figure 5-10: the parabola, fx x 2, and the absolute value function, gx x . FIGURE 5-10:  The graphs of fx x 2 and gx x . 78 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites Notice that both functions are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. In other words, the left and right sides of each graph are mirror images of each other. This makes them even functions. A polynomial function like y xx94 3 42 , where all powers of x are even, is one type of even function. (Such an even polynomial function can contain — but need not contain — a constant term like the 3 in the preceding function. This makes sense because 3 is the same as 3 0x and zero is an even number.) Another even function is y xcos (see Chapter 6). A couple of oddball functions Graph fx x 3 and gx x 3 on your graphing calculator. These two functions illustrate odd symmetry. Odd functions are symmetric with respect to the origin, which means that if you were to rotate them 180 about the origin, they would land on themselves. A polynomial func- tion like y xx x42 53 , where all powers of x are odd, is one type of odd function. (Unlike an even polynomial function, an odd polynomial function cannot contain a constant term.) Another odd function is y xsin (see Chapter 6). Many functions are neither even nor odd, for example y xx35 2 . My high school English teacher said a paragraph should never have just one sentence, so voilà, now it’s got two. Exponential functions An exponential function is one with a power that contains a variable, such as fx x2 or gx x10 . Figure 5-11 shows the graphs of both these functions on the same x-y coordinate system. Both functions go through the point 01,, as do all exponential functions of the form fx b x . When b is greater than 1, you have exponential growth. All such functions get higher and higher without limit as they go to the right toward positive infinity. As they go to the left toward nega- tive infinity, they crawl along the x-axis, always getting closer to the axis, but never touch- ing it. You use these and related functions for figuring things like investments, inflation, and growing population. FIGURE 5-11:  The graphs of fx x2 and gx x10 . CHAPTER 5 Funky Functions and Their Groovy Graphs 79 When b is between 0 and 1, you have an exponential decay function. The graphs of such func- tions are like exponential growth functions in reverse. Exponential decay functions also cross the y-axis at 01,, but they go up to the left forever, and crawl along the x-axis to the right. These functions model things that shrink over time, such as the radioactive decay of uranium. Logarithmic functions A logarithmic function is simply an exponential function with the x- and y-axes switched. In other words, the up-and-down direction on an exponential graph corresponds to the right- and-left direction on a logarithmic graph, and the right-and-left direction on an exponen- tial graph corresponds to the up-and-down direction on a logarithmic graph. (If you want a refresher on logs, see Chapter 4.) You can see this relationship in Figure 5-12, in which both fx x2 and gx xlog 2 are graphed on the same set of axes. Both exponential and logarithmic functions are monotonic. A monotonic function either goes up over its entire domain (called an increasing function) or goes down over its entire domain (a decreasing function). (I’m assuming here — as is almost always the case — that the motion along the function is from left to right.) Notice the symmetry of the two functions in Figure 5-12 about the line y x. This makes them inverses of each other, which brings me to the next topic. FIGURE 5-12:  The graphs of fx x2 and gx xlog 2 . 80 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites Q. For the line gx x54 , what’s the slope and what’s the y-intercept? A. The slope is –4 and the y-intercept is 5. All you need to answer this question is y mx b. 4 If the slope of line l is 3, a. What’s the slope of a line parallel to l? b. What’s the slope of a line perpendicular to l? 5 Sketch a graph of fx e x. 6 Sketch a graph of gx xln . CHAPTER 5 Funky Functions and Their Groovy Graphs 81 Inverse Functions The function fx xx 2 0(for ) and the function fx x 1 (read as “f inverse of x”) are inverse functions because each undoes what the other does. In other words, fx x 2 takes an input of, say, 3 and produces an output of 9 (because 39 2 ); fx x 1 takes the 9 and turns it back into the 3 (because 93). Notice that f 39 and f 1 93. You can write all of this in one step as ff 1 33. It works the same way if you start with fx 1 : f 1 16 4 (because 16 4), and f 416 (because 4 16 2 ). If you write this in one step, you get ff 1 16 16. (Note that while only fx 1 is read as f inverse of x, both functions are inverses of each other.) The inverse function rule: The fancy way of summing up all of this is to say that fx and fx 1 are inverse functions if and only if ff xx 1 and ff xx 1 . Don’t confuse the superscript 1 in f x 1 with the exponent 1. The exponent 1 gives you the reciprocal of something, for example x x 1 1 . But fx 1 is the inverse of fx . It does not equal 1 fx , which is the reciprocal of fx . So why is the exact same symbol used for two different things? Beats me. When you graph inverse functions, each is the mirror image of the other, reflected over the line y x. Look at Figure  5-13, which graphs the inverse functions fx xx 2 0(for ) and fx x 1 . If you rotate the graph in Figure 5-13 counterclockwise so that the line y x is vertical, you can easily see that fx and fx 1 are mirror images of each other. One consequence of this sym- metry is that if a point like 2, 4 is on one of the functions, the point 4, 2 will be on the other. Also, the domain of f is the range of f 1, and the range of f is the domain of f 1. FIGURE 5-13:  The graphs of fx x 2 ( ),x 0 and fx x 1 . 82 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites Q. If the inverse of f is g, and fp q, what do gp and gq equal? A. gq p; nothing can be said about gp . gq must equal p, because since f sends p to q, f’s inverse must send q to p. With regard to gp , the inverse relationship between f and g tells you nothing about the output of gp . 7 The following figure shows the graph of fx . Sketch the inverse of f, fx 1 . 8 What’s the inverse of fx x45? CHAPTER 5 Funky Functions and Their Groovy Graphs 83 Shifts, Reflections, Stretches, and Shrinks Any function can be transformed into a related function by shifting it horizontally or vertically, flipping it over horizontally or vertically, or stretching or shrinking it horizontally or vertically. I do the horizontal transformations first. Consider the exponential function y x2 , shown in Figure 5-14. Horizontal transformations Horizontal changes are made by adding a number to or subtracting a number from the input variable x or by multiplying x by some number. All horizontal transformations, except reflec- tion, work the opposite way you’d expect: Adding to x makes the function go left, subtracting from x makes the function go right, multiplying x by a number greater than 1 shrinks the func- tion, and multiplying x by a number less than 1 expands the function. For example, the graph of y x2 3 has the same shape and orientation as the graph in Figure 5-14; it’s just shifted three units to the left. Instead of passing through 01, and 1, 2 , the shifted function goes through 31, and 2, 2 . And the graph of y x2 3 is three units to the right of y x2 . The original function and both transformations are shown in Figure 5-15. FIGURE 5-14:  The graph of y x2. 84 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites If you multiply the x in y x2 by 2, the function shrinks horizontally by a factor of 2. So, every point on the new function is half of its original distance from the y-axis. The y-coordinate of every point stays the same; the x-coordinate is cut in half. For example, y x2 goes through 1, 2 , so y x22 goes through 1 2 , 2 ; y x2 goes through 4 1 16 , , so y x22 goes through 2 1 16 ,. Multiplying x by a number less than 1 has the opposite effect. When y x2 is trans- formed into y x2 14(/ ) , every point on y x2 is pulled away from the y-axis to a distance 4 times what it was. To visualize the graph of y x2 14(/ ) , imagine you’ve got the graph of y x2 on an elastic coordinate system. Grab the coordinate system on the left and right and stretch it by a factor of 4, pulling everything away from the y-axis, but keeping the y-axis in the center. Now you’ve got the graph of y x2 14(/ ) . Check these transformations out on your graphing calculator. The last horizontal transformation is a reflection over the y-axis. Multiplying the x in y x2 by 1 reflects it over or flips it over the y-axis. For instance, the point 1, 2 becomes 1, 2 and 2 1 4 , becomes 2 1 4 , . See Figure 5-16. FIGURE 5-16:  The graphs of y x2 and y x2. FIGURE 5-15:  The graphs of y x2 , y x2 3, and y x2 3. CHAPTER 5 Funky Functions and Their Groovy Graphs 85 Vertical transformations To transform a function vertically, you add a number to or subtract a number from the entire function or multiply the whole function by a number. To do something to an entire function, say y x10 , imagine that the entire right side of the equation is inside parentheses, like y x10 . Now, all vertical transformations are made by placing a number somewhere on the right side of the equation outside the parentheses. (Often, you don’t actually need the parentheses, but sometimes you do.) Unlike horizontal transformations, vertical transformations work the way you expect: Adding makes the function go up, subtracting makes it go down, multiplying by a number greater than 1 stretches the function, and multiplying by a number less than 1 shrinks the function. For example, consider the following transformations of the function y x10 : y x10 6 shifts the original function up 6 units. y x10 2 shifts the original function down 2 units. y x510  stretches the original function vertically by a factor of 5. y x1 3 10  shrinks the original function vertically by a factor of 3. Multiplying the function by 1 reflects it over the x-axis, or, in other words, flips it upside down. Look at these transformations on your graphing calculator. As you saw in the previous section, horizontal transformations change only the x-coordinates of points, leaving the y-coordinates unchanged. Conversely, vertical transformations change only the y-coordinates of points, leaving the x-coordinates unchanged. Q. Consider the simple parabola fx x 2. How does gx x54 10 3 2 compare to f? A. g makes two horizontal changes to f: It 1) slides it 10 to the left and 2) compresses it horizontally by a factor of 4. g also makes two vertical changes to f: It 1) stretches it vertically by a factor of 5, and 2) slides it up 3. Note a few things. First, I gave the horizontal changes before the vertical changes, but, when you transform a function, it doesn’t matter whether you tackle the horizontal or the vertical transformations first. However, if you have more than one horizontal change, you must do those in the right order. And ditto if you have more than one vertical change. For horizontal transformations, not only do they work in the opposite way you’d expect, but you must do the PEMDAS order backwards. For this problem, the horizontal changes are multiplying by 4 and adding 10. PEMDAS tells you to do the multiplication before the addition, so you need to reverse that. That’s why you first must slide f 10 to the left and second compress f by 4. Everything about vertical transformations works the way you’d expect, including PEMDAS. 86 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites 9 The figure shows the graph of px x2 . Sketch the following transformation of p: q x x25 3 . 10 Consider the parabola fx x 2 again. The transformation gx x3 2 compresses f horizontally by a factor of 3. What vertical transformation of f would achieve the same result as that horizontal transformation? CHAPTER 5 Funky Functions and Their Groovy Graphs 87 Practice Questions Answers and Explanations 1 (a) x 4. You can’t take the square root of a negative (not for basic calculus, anyway, which deals with real numbers), so 4 0 4 x x That’s all there is to it. Don’t forget, there’s nothing wrong with the square root of zero, which equals zero. So, 4 is in the domain of g. (b) gx 0. Range questions are usually a bit harder than domain questions. With domain questions, you just have to figure out what x cannot be, and the domain is everything else. With range questions, there’s no method quite that straightforward. To tackle a range question, you can experiment with different input values and see what happens with the output. And, of course, you can graph the function to actually see the range, though that won’t always give you the precise answer. Sometimes, like with the function in Problem 2, you can’t get the precise answer without doing some calculus. You can solve the current problem easily by just looking at the graph of the function. But it’ll also come in handy to familiarize yourself with the following approach. Consider what the graph of y x looks like. If you don’t remember the graph, you should graph it now on your calculator. You see the top half of a sideways parabola that begins at 0, 0 and goes up and to the right forever. Because it begins at a height of zero and goes up forever, the range is y 0. The current function, gx x4 , is a transformation of the parent function, y x . There are two transformations: the 4 and the minus sign, which is the same as multiplying x by –1. Because both transformations occur “inside” the function and change the input of the function, they are both horizontal transformations. (To transform the parent function, y x , into gx x4 , you first slide it 4 to the left and then flip it over the y-axis.) Horizontal transformations change the domain but have no impact on the range, so the range of gx x4 is the same as the range of y x , namely, y 0. 88 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites 2 5, 00,0 or 5xx(). Just ask yourself what x is not allowed to be. x can’t equal zero because that would make the denominator zero. And x can’t equal –5 because that would give you the square root of zero, which is zero, so, again, the denominator would equal zero. That takes care of the zero denominator issue. Then there’s the issue of no negatives under the square root. So, x can’t be less than –5. That does it. The domain is everything else — everything except what I just excluded. 3 4ab. fa b tells you to plug a + b into the f function, x 2. Thus, fa ba ba ba ba ab b 2 222 (If you thought ab 2 was a b 22, go directly to jail and do not collect $200!) And fa ba ba ba ba ab b 2 222 . Finally, fa bf ab aabb aabb aabb aabb 22 22 22 22 22 22 44ab 4 (a) The slope of a line parallel to l is 3. (b) The slope of a line perpendicular to l is 1 3 , the opposite reciprocal of 3. 5 See the following figure. CHAPTER 5 Funky Functions and Their Groovy Graphs 89 6 See the following figure. 7 You obtain fx 1 by reflecting fx over the line y x. See the following figure. 8 f x x x 1 2 5 4 0(). First, replace fx with y and then switch the x and y: y x xy 45 45 Now just solve for y: xy xy xy x y 45 45 54 5 4 2 2 2 That’s it for the math, but one issue remains. The domain of a function equals the range of its inverse, and the range of a function equals the domain of its inverse. The range of f is 0, , so that must become the domain of its inverse. So, you have to restrict the domain of f 1 to [, )0 . That does it. 90 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites 9 You obtain q x from px by taking px and sliding it 3 to the left and 5 up. See the follow- ing figure. Note that q x contains “x plus 3,” but the horizontal transformation is 3 to the left — the opposite of what you’d expect. The “+5” in q x tells you to go up 5. Horizontal transformations always work opposite the way you’d expect; and PEMDAS works backwards. Vertical transformations, on the other hand, go the normal way — up for plus and down for minus; and PEMDAS works the normal way. 10 A vertical stretch by a factor of 9. gx xx39 2 2. The multiplication by 9 you see here occurs “outside” the x 2 , and is thus a vertical transformation. It’s a vertical stretch by a factor of 9. (By the way, it is only with some simple functions like f that you can achieve the same transformed function by either a horizontal or a vertical transformation.)

(b) Give an example of two lines that are perpendicular to each other but where the product of their slopes is different from your answer to Part (a). (You should give the equations of your two example lines.) 7 Use the following functions for this and the next problem. Given fx x , what is fx 1 ? 8 Where do fx and fx 1 intersect? 92 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites Answers to Chapter 5 Quiz 1 x x 32. The domain is , ; the range is , . You can avoid a bit of messiness by first determining fx . Then your answer will just be the opposite of that: fx xx xx 32 32 The answer is the opposite of that, namely, xx 32. (Note that you cannot distribute the sub- traction sign in the first line of this equation.) The domain of fx xx 32 is ,  — or all real numbers — because there are no restrictions on what you can plug into x. The range is also , because this continuous polynomial function goes down to negative infinity and up to infinity. 2 f xx xx xx 11 3 1 2 . Now you can do the squaring and cubing of those binomials by using the squaring and cubing patterns: ab aabb ab aa babb 2 22 3 32 23 2 33 Thus, xx xx xx xx xx 1 2 22 1 3 31 3 2 33 Putting it all together gives you fx xx xx xx x xx xx xx 13 13 22 31 32 2 33 2 33 2 xx xx xx 32 12 332 3 How about the nice symmetry in that final answer? 3 (a) Neither even nor odd. For polynomial functions, all you need to check is whether the powers are even or odd (and since a constant, say 6, is the same as 6 0x , and since zero is an even number, con- stants count as even terms). The coefficients are irrelevant. If all the powers are even, you have an even function; if all the powers are odd, you’ve got an odd function; if there’s a mix, the function is neither even nor odd. fx has a power two term and a power one term (or, to speak more mathematically, it has a quadratic term and a linear term), so this function is neither even nor odd. CHAPTER 5 Funky Functions and Their Groovy Graphs 93 (b) Neither even nor odd. The powers in this function are 3, 1, and 0, so this function is neither even nor odd. (c) Even. The powers here are 4 and 0, so this function is even. (d) Odd. The powers here are 3 and 1, so this function is odd. It wouldn’t be a bad idea for you to graph these four functions to confirm the answers visually. Even functions are symmetric with respect to the y-axis (a left-right symmetry). Odd functions are symmetric with respect to the origin (that’s a rotational type of symmetry — if you took the function and rotated it 180 about the origin, it would land on itself). 4 (a) Odd. If you graph the sine function, you see that it’s an odd function. (b) Even. As you can see from its graph, the cosine function is even. (c) Even. The ordinary sine function is odd, but this function is even. The formal way of showing that a function is even is to show that fx fx . Let’s check this for gx : gx xsin 2 , which equals sin x 2 , and that equals gx so, yes, it checks. (d) Odd. The ordinary cosine function is even, but this function is odd. The formal way of showing that a function is odd is to show that fx fx . Let’s check this for gx : gx xxcos , which equals xxcos from the basic trig identity, cos cosxx . xxcos equals gx so, yes, it checks. 5 y x20 5. . First, note that the slope of the given line is –0.5 or 1 2. Perpendicular lines have opposite reciprocal slopes, and the opposite reciprocal of 1 2 is 2, so that’s the slope of the line you’re looking for. Finish with the point-slope form for the equation of a line: y ym xx11 : y x yx yx 05 20 5 05 21 20 5 .. . . 6 (a) –1. Is that a softball question or what? The slopes are 1 2 and 2, so their product is –1. The product of opposite reciprocals is always –1. 94 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites (b) Two examples are y 15 and x 6. While it’s true that the product of opposite reciprocals is always –1, if one of the lines is horizontal (slope of zero), and the other is vertical (undefined slope), the product of their slopes is undefined. Your answer should be any horizontal line like y 15 and any verti- cal line like x 6. 7 f xx x 12 0, . You’ve got the function y x . Switch the x and y then solve for y: xy y x 2 Thus, fx x 12 — well, almost. Don’t forget: You’ve got to check your answer’s domain and range. The range of a function’s inverse must be the same as the domain of the original function, and the domain of a function’s inverse must be the same as the range of the origi- nal function. The range of fx x 12 matches the domain of fx x , but the domain of fx x 12, namely, all real numbers, is larger than the range of fx x , which is all non- negative numbers. So, you’ve got to restrict the domain of the inverse. Your final answer is fx xx 12 0, . 8 The functions intersect at 00, and 11, . Set the two functions equal to each other and solve: xx xx xx xx xx 2 2 2 2 4 4 3 0 10 Let’s pause here for a minute to observe two things. First, note that you should not cancel an x in line three — which would give you 1 3x . That’s generally not a good idea. That cancel- ling will often — as it does here — cause you to miss the solution of zero. Second, if you stopped here, and sort of relied on common sense to conclude that x equals 0 or 1, you’d be correct. But if you want to make your math teacher or professor happy, you’ll finish like so. xx xx xx 3 2 10 11 0 (using the difference of cubes factor pattern) The zero product property gives you the obvious answers of 0 and 1, and then you’d also have xx 2 10. But since the discriminant of that quadratic is negative, its zeros are both imag- inary. The function and its inverse thus intersect at x 0 and x 1. Plug those x-values into either function to get the y-values. The functions intersect at 00, and 1, 1 . That’s a wrap. CHAPTER 6 The Trig Tango 95 The Trig Tango B elieve it or not, trigonometry is a very practical, real-world branch of mathemat- ics, because it involves the measurement of lengths and angles. Surveyors use it when surveying property, making topographical maps, and so on. The Ancient Greeks and Alexandrians, among others, knew not only simple SohCahToa stuff, but a lot of sophisticated trig as well. They used it for building, navigation, and astronomy. Trigonometry comes up a lot in the study of calculus, so if you snoozed through high school trig, WAKE UP! and review the following trig basics. Starting off with SohCahToa The study of trig begins with the right triangle. The three main trig functions (sine, cosine, and tangent) and their reciprocals (cosecant, secant, and cotangent) all tell you something about the lengths of the sides of a right triangle that contains a given acute angle — like angle x in Figure  6-1. The longest side of this right triangle (or any right triangle), the diagonal side, is called the hypotenuse. The side that’s 3 units long in this right triangle is referred to as the opposite side because it’s on the opposite side of the triangle from angle x, and the side of length 4 is called the adjacent side because it’s adjacent to, or touching, angle x. SohCahToa is a meaningless mnemonic device that helps you remember the definitions of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions. SohCahToa uses the initial letters of sine, cosine, and tangent, and the initial letters of hypotenuse, opposite, and adjacent to help you remember the following definitions. (To remember how to spell SohCahToa, note its pronunciation and the fact that it contains three groups of three letters each.)

But I’m showing them to you again so you can see how SohCahToa works with them. When you apply the SohCahToa trig functions and their reciprocals to the 45 angle in the 454590-- triangle, you get the following trig values: sin .45 1 2 2 2 071 O H csc .45 2 1 21 41 H O cos .45 1 2 2 2 071 A H sec .45 2 1 21 41 H A tan45 1 1 1 O A cot 45 1 1 1 A O FIGURE 6-1:  You’re studying calculus, so maybe you thought right triangles were behind you. Guess again. CHAPTER 6 The Trig Tango 97 And here’s how SahCahToa works with the 30 angle in the 30 60 90-- triangle: sin30 1 2 O H csc30 2 1 2 H O cos .30 3 2 087 A H sec .30 2 3 23 3 115 H A tan .30 1 3 3 3 058 O A cot .30 3 1 31 73 A O The 30 60 90-- triangle kills two birds with one stone because it also gives you the trig values for a 60 angle. Look at Figure 6-2 again. For the 60 angle, the 3 side of the triangle is now the opposite side for purposes of SohCahToa because it’s on the opposite side of the triangle from the 60 angle. The 1-unit side becomes the adjacent side for the 60 angle, and the 2-unit side is still, of course, the hypotenuse. Now use SohCahToa again to find the trig values for the 60 angle: sin .60 3 2 087 O H csc .60 2 3 23 3 115 H O cos60 1 2 A H sec60 2 1 2 H A tan .60 3 1 31 73 O A cot .60 1 3 3 3 058 A O The mnemonic device SohCahToa, along with the two oh-so-easy-to-remember right triangles in Figure 6-2, gives you the answers to 18 trig problems! Circling the Enemy with the Unit Circle SohCahToa only works with right triangles, and so it can only handle acute angles — angles less than 90 . (The angles in a triangle must add up to 180 ; because a right triangle has a 90 angle, the other two angles must each be less than 90 .) With the unit circle, however, you can find trig values for any size angle. The unit circle has a radius of one unit and is set in an x-y coordinate system with its center at the origin. See Figure 6-3. Figure 6-3 has quite a lot of information, but don’t panic; it will all make perfect sense in a minute. FIGURE 6-2:  The ubiquitous 454590-- and 30 60 90-- triangles. 98 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites Angles in the unit circle Measuring angles: To measure an angle in the unit circle, start at the positive x-axis and go counterclockwise to the terminal side of the angle. For example, the 150 angle in Figure 6-3 begins at the positive x-axis and ends at the segment that hits the unit circle at 3 2 1 2 , . If you go clockwise instead, you get an angle with a nega- tive measure (like the 70 angle in the figure). Measuring angles with radians You know all about degrees. You know what 45 and 90 angles look like; you know that about face means a turn of 180 and that turning all the way around till you’re back to where you started is a 360 turn. But degrees aren’t the only way to measure angles. You can also use radians. Degrees and radi- ans are just two different ways to measure angles, like inches and centimeters are two ways to measure length. Definition of radian: The radian measure of an angle is the length of the arc along the circum- ference of the unit circle cut off by the angle. Look at the 30 angle in quadrant I of Figure 6-3. Do you see the bolded section of the circle’s circumference that is cut off by that angle? Because a whole circle is 360 , that 30 angle is one- twelfth of the circle. So, the length of the bold arc is one-twelfth of the circle’s circumference. Circumference is given by the formula C r2 . This circle has a radius of 1, so its circumfer- ence equals 2 . Because the bold arc is one-twelfth of that, its length is 6 , which is the radian measure of the 30 angle. FIGURE 6-3:  The so-called unit circle. CHAPTER 6 The Trig Tango 99 360 equals 2 radians. The unit circle’s circumference of 2 makes it easy to remember that 360 equals 2 radians. Half the circumference has a length of , so 180 equals radians. If you focus on the fact that 180 equals radians, other angles are easy: » 90 is half of 180 , so 90 equals half of , or 2 radians. » 60 is a third of 180 , so 60 equals a third of , or 3 radians. » 45 is a fourth of 180 , so 45 equals a fourth of , or 4 radians. » 30 is a sixth of 180 , so 30 equals a sixth of , or 6 radians. Formulas for converting from degrees to radians and vice versa: » To convert from degrees to radians, multiply the angle’s measure by 180 . » To convert from radians to degrees, multiply the angle’s measure by 180 . By the way, the word radian comes from radius. Look at Figure 6-3 again. An angle measuring 1 radian (about 57 ) cuts off an arc along the circumference of this circle that’s the same length as the circle’s radius. This is true not only of unit circles, but of circles of any size. In other words, take the radius of any circle, lay it along the circle’s circumference, and that arc creates an angle of 1 radian. Radians are preferred over degrees. In this or any other calculus book, some problems use degrees and others use radians, but radians are the preferred unit. If a problem doesn’t specify the unit, do the problem in radians. Honey, I shrunk the hypotenuse Look at the unit circle in Figure 6-3 again. See the 30 60 90-- triangle in quadrant I? It’s the same shape but half the size of the one in Figure 6-2. Each of its sides is half as long. Because its hypotenuse now has a length of 1, and because when H is 1, O H equals O, the sine of the 30 angle, which equals O H , ends up equaling the length of the opposite side. The opposite side is 1 2, so that’s the sine of 30 . Note that the length of the opposite side is the same as the y-coordinate of the point 3 2 1 2 , . If you figure the cosine of 30° in this triangle, it ends up equaling the length of the adjacent side, which is the same as the x-coordinate of 3 2 1 2 , . Notice that these values for sin30 and cos30 are the same as the ones given by the 30 60 90-- triangle in Figure  6-2. This shows you, by the way, that shrinking a right triangle down (or blowing it up) has no effect on the trigonometric values for the angles in the triangle. Now look at the 30 60 90-- triangle in quadrant II in Figure 6-3. Because it’s the same size as the 30 60 90-- triangle in quadrant I, which hits the circle at 3 2 1 2 , , the triangle in quad- rant II hits the circle at a point that’s straight across from and symmetric to 3 2 1 2 , . The 100 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites coordinates of the point in quadrant II are 3 2 1 2 , . But remember that angles on the unit circle are all measured from the positive x-axis, so the hypotenuse of this triangle indicates a 150 angle; and that’s the angle, not 30 , associated with the point 3 2 1 2 , . The cosine of 150 is given by the x-coordinate of this point, 3 2 , and the sine of 150 equals the y-coordinate, 1 2. Coordinates on the unit circle tell you an angle’s cosine and sine. The terminal side of an angle in the unit circle hits the circle at a point whose x-coordinate is the angle’s cosine and whose y-coordinate is the angle’s sine. Here’s a mnemonic: x and y are in alphabetical order as are cosine and sine. Putting it all together Look at Figure 6-4. Now that you know all about the 454590-- triangle, you can easily work out — or take my word for it — that a 454590-- triangle in quadrant I hits the unit circle at 2 2 2 2 , . And if you take the 30 60 90-- triangle in quadrant I that hits the unit circle at 3 2 1 2 , and flip it on its side, you get another 30 60 90-- triangle with a 60 angle that hits the circle at 1 2 3 2 , . As you can see, this point has the same coordinates as those for the 30 angle, but reversed. How to draw a right triangle in the unit circle: Whenever you draw a right triangle in the unit circle, put the acute angle you care about at the origin — that’s 0, 0  — and then put the right angle on the x-axis — never on the y-axis. FIGURE 6-4:  Quadrant I of the unit circle with three angles and their coordinates. CHAPTER 6 The Trig Tango 101 3 2 is greater than 1 2 . To keep from mixing up the numbers 1 2 and 3 2 when dealing with a 30 or a 60 angle, note that because 3 is more than 1, 3 2 must be greater than 1 2 1 2 05 3 2 087.; . . Thus, because a 30 angle hits the circle further out to the right than up, the x-coordinate must be greater than the y-coordinate. So, the point must be 3 2 1 2 , , not the other way around. It’s vice versa for a 60 angle. Now for the whole enchilada. Because of the symmetry in the four quadrants, the three points in quadrant I in Figure  6-4 have counterparts in the other three quadrants, giving you 12 known points. Add to these the four points on the axes, 1, 0 , 01, , 1, 0 , and 01, , and you have 16 total points, each with an associated angle, as shown in Figure 6-5. These 16 pairs of coordinates automatically give you the cosine and sine of the 16 angles. And because tan sin cos , you can obtain the tangent of these 16 angles by dividing an angle’s y-coordinate by its x-coordinate. (Note that when the cosine of an angle equals zero, the tan- gent is undefined because you can’t divide by zero.) Finally, you can find the cosecant, secant, and cotangent of the 16 angles because these trig functions are just the reciprocals of sine, cosine, and tangent. (Same caution: whenever sine, cosine, or tangent equals zero, the recip- rocal function is undefined.) You’ve now got, at your fingertips — okay, maybe that’s a bit of a stretch — the answers to 96 trig questions. Learn the unit circle. Knowing the trig values from the unit circle is quite useful in calculus. So quiz yourself. Start by memorizing the 454590-- and the 30 60 90-- triangles. Then picture how these triangles fit into the four quadrants of the unit circle. Use the symmetry of the quad- rants as an aid. With some practice, you can get pretty quick at figuring out the values for the six trig functions of all 16 angles. (Try to do this without looking at something like Figure 6-5.) FIGURE 6-5:  The unit circle with 16 angles and their coordinates. 102 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites And quiz yourself with radians as well as with degrees. That would bring your total to 192 trig facts! Quick — what’s the secant of 210 , and what’s the cosine of 2 3 ? Here are the answers (no peeking): 23 3 1 2 and . All Students Take Calculus. Here’s a final tip to help you with the unit circle and the values of all the trig functions. Take any old unit circle (like the one in Figure 6-5) and write the initial letters of All Students Take Calculus in the four quadrants: Put an A in quadrant I, an S in quadrant II, a T in quadrant III, and a C in quadrant IV. These letters now tell you whether the various trig functions have positive or negative values in the different quadrants. The A in quadrant I tells you that All six trig functions have positive values in quadrant I. The S in quadrant II tells you that Sine (and its reciprocal, cosecant) are positive in quadrant II and that all other trig functions are negative there. The T in quadrant III tells you that Tangent (and its reciprocal, cotangent) are positive in quadrant III and that the other functions are negative there. Finally, the C in quadrant IV tells you that Cosine (and its reciprocal, secant) are positive there and that the other functions are negative. That’s a wrap. Q. Use the unit circle in Figure 6-5 to determine the following: tan ______? cot ______? sec ______? csc ____ 210 3 4 300 2 3 ___? A. tan ,cot ,sec ,csc210 3 3 3 4 1 300 2 2 3 23 3 . For tan210 , go to 210 degrees on the unit circle, where you see the coordinates 3 2 1 2 , . The tangent of a unit circle angle equals the y-coordinate divided by the x-coordinate (and for tangent (or cotangent) problems like this, you can ignore the denominators). So that gives you 1 3 3 3 (note that the negatives cancel). For cot 3 4 , note the coordinates at 3 4 radians or 135 degrees, namely, 2 2 2 2 , . The cotangent of a unit circle angle equals the x-coordinate divided by the y-coordinate. That gives you –1. For the third problem, note that the coordinates at 300 degrees are 1 2 3 2 , , and that secant equals the reciprocal of cosine — which is given by the x-coordinate. The reciprocal of 1 2 is, of course, 2. Finally, at 2 3 radians or –120 degrees, the coordinates are 1 2 3 2 , . Cosecant is the reciprocal of sine, which is given by the y-coordinate. The reciprocal of 3 2 is 23 3 . CHAPTER 6 The Trig Tango 103 1 Use the right triangle to complete the table.

Try to get the answers to the three pieces in your head — then finish the multipli- cation on paper. 11 Express sec x xtan2 in terms of sines and cosines. 12 Solve cos sinxx20 in the interval 02, . 106 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites Graphing Sine, Cosine, and Tangent Figure 6-6 shows the graphs of sine, cosine, and tangent, which you can, of course, produce on a graphing calculator. Definitions of periodic and period: Sine, cosine, and tangent — and their reciprocals, cosecant, secant, and cotangent — are periodic functions, which means that their graphs contain a basic shape that repeats over and over indefinitely to the left and the right. The period of such a func- tion is the horizontal span of one of its cycles. If you know the unit circle, you can easily reproduce these three graphs by hand. First, note that the sine and cosine graphs are the same shape — cosine is the same as sine, just slid 90 to the left. Also, notice that their simple wave shape goes as high as 1 and as low as 1 and goes on forever to the left and right, with the same shape repeating every 360 . That’s the period of both functions, 360 . (It’s no coincidence, by the way, that 360 is also once around the unit circle.) The unit circle tells you that sin00, sin90 1, sin180 0, sin270 1, and sin360 0. If you start with these five points, you can sketch one cycle. The cycle then repeats to the left and right. You can use the unit circle in the same manner to sketch the cosine function (you do this in practice problem 13). Notice in Figure 6-6 that the period of the tangent function is 180 . If you remember that and the basic pattern of repeating backward S-shapes, then sketching it isn’t difficult. Because tan y x , you can use the unit circle to determine that tan ,45 1 tan00, and tan45 1. That gives you the points 45 1, , 0, 0 , and 45 1, . Since tan 90 and tan90 are both undefined (because y x at these points gives you a zero in the denominator), you draw vertical asymptotes at 90 and 90 . FIGURE 6-6:  The graphs of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions. CHAPTER 6 The Trig Tango 107 Definition of vertical asymptote: A vertical asymptote is an imaginary line that a curve gets closer and closer to (but never touches) as the curve goes up toward infinity or down toward negative infinity. (In Chapters 7 and 8, you see more vertical asymptotes and also some hori- zontal asymptotes.) The two asymptotes at 90 and 90 and the three points at 45 1, , 0, 0 , and 45 1, show you where to sketch one backward S. The S-shapes then repeat every 180° to the left and the right. Inverse Trig Functions An inverse trig function, like any inverse function, reverses what the original function does. For example, sin30 1 2 , so the inverse sine function — written as sin 1 — reverses the input and output. Thus, sin 1 1 2 30 . It works the same for the other trig functions. The negative 1 superscript in the sine inverse function is not a negative 1 power, despite the fact that it looks just like it. Raising something to the negative 1 power gives you its reciprocal, so you might think that sin 1 x is the reciprocal of sin ,x but the reciprocal of sine is cosecant, not sine inverse. Pretty weird that the same symbol is used to mean two different things. Go figure. The only trick with inverse trig functions is memorizing their ranges — that’s the interval of their outputs. Consider sine inverse, for example. Because both sin30 1 2 and sin150 1 2 , you wouldn’t know whether sin 1 1 2 equals 30 or 150 unless you know how the interval of sine inverse outputs is defined. And remember, in order for something to be a function, there can’t be any mystery about the output for a given input. If you reflect the sine function over the line y x to create its inverse, you get a vertical wave that isn’t a function because it doesn’t pass the vertical line test. (See the definition of the vertical line test in Chapter  5.) To make sine inverse a function, you have to take a small piece of the vertical wave that does pass the vertical line test. The same thing goes for the other inverse trig functions. Here are their ranges: The range of sin 1 x is 22 , , or 90 90, . The range of cos 1 x is 0, , or 0 180, . The range of tan 1 x is 22 , , or 90 90, . The range of cot 1 x is 0, , or 0 180, . Note the pattern: The range of sin 1 x is basically the same as tan 1 x, and the range of cos 1 x is basically the same as cot 1 x. Believe it or not, calculus authors don’t agree on the ranges for the secant inverse and cosecant inverse functions. You’d think they could agree on this like they do with just about everything else in mathematics. Humph. Use the ranges given in your particular textbook. If you don’t have a textbook, use the sin 1 x range for its cousin csc 1 x , and use the cos 1 x range for sec 1 x . (By the way, I don’t refer to csc 1 x as the reciprocal of sin 1 x because it’s not its reciprocal — even though csc x is the reciprocal of sin x. Ditto for cos 1 x and sec 1 x .) 108 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites Identifying with Trig Identities Remember trig identities like sin cos 22 1xx and sin sincos22xx x ?

It shows the relationship between y xsin and y xsin 1 . (The dashed sine curve is just like the sine graph in Figure 6-6 except that the angles on the x-axis are in radians instead of degrees.) The inverse sine graph is created by flipping the solid portion of the sine wave over the line y = x. The endpoints of y xsin 1 are at 1 2 , and 1 2 , . 13 Using the unit circle in Figure 6-5, but not peaking at Figure 6-6, sketch y xcos . 14 Using your answers from Problem 4 and your knowledge of the ranges of the inverse trig functions, complete the following table.

Of course, you can just look at the unit circle to get your answer. Secant is the reciprocal of cosine. The unit circle tells you that cos 11 6 (or 330 ) is 3 2 . Flip that upside down for your answer: 2 3 , or 23 3 . But if you’re ambitious and want to try this one in your head, you first notice that 330 doesn’t end in a 5, so you have a 30 60 90-- triangle, not a 454590-- triangle. Then you just picture where 330 is — it’s in quadrant IV close to 360 (the x-axis). So, your 30 60 90-- tri- angle has to be wide and short, which has a big x-coordinate, 3 2 , and a small y-coordinate, 1 2. Because secant is the reciprocal of cosine, you care about the x-coordinate, 3 2 . Flip it upside down for your answer. 8 23 3 . The unit circle gives you your answer. Cosecant is the reciprocal of sine. The unit circle tells you that sin 4 3 (or 240 ) is 3 2 . Flip that upside down for your answer: 2 3 , or 23 3 . To do this one in your head, you first notice that 240 doesn’t end in a 5, so you have a 30 60 90-- triangle, not a 454590-- triangle. Then you just picture where 240 is — it’s in quadrant III close to 270 (the y-axis). So your 30 60 90-- triangle has to be narrow and tall, which has a small x-coordinate, 1 2, and a big y-coordinate, 3 2 (note that in this context, when I talk about a big or small coordinate, I’m ignoring the positive/negative issue). Because cosecant is the reciprocal of sine, you care about the y-coordinate, 3 2 . Flip it upside down for your answer. 9 Undefined. This problem is a bit tricky because there’s a catch (actually two catches). But other than that, it’s actually short and simple. An angle of 3 radians is the same as radians, so you just use the coordinates from the unit circle at radians or 180 degrees — namely, 1, 0 . Tangent equals sin cos , or y x , so tan 3 0 1 0. Cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent, so cot 3 1 0 , which is undefined. (Don’t forget, you can’t divide by zero!) Thus, your answer for tan cot33 is zero times undefined, which is undefined. CHAPTER 6 The Trig Tango 111 Here are the two catches: First, you might think that zero times undefined is zero because zero times anything is zero. But it doesn’t work that way. If any piece of a problem is unde- fined, the answer is undefined. The second catch is that you could mistakenly conclude that since tangent and cotangent are reciprocals, their product would be 1. That is generally true of reciprocals, but not here because, again, one of them is undefined. The two values you get here, zero and undefined, are sort of, but not technically, reciprocals. So, you can’t multiply them to get 1. No matter how you look at it, the answer is undefined. 10 6 4 . You should be able to picture in your head that the coordinates on the unit circle at 30 , 45 , and 60 are 3 2 1 2 , , 2 2 2 2 , , and 1 2 3 2 , , respectively. So, sin30 1 2 and cos45 2 2 . For the tangent piece of the problem, here’s a tip. Tangent equals y x , but when doing tangent problems on the unit circle, you don’t have to bother dividing the y-fraction by the x-fraction. The denominators of these fractions always cancel, so you only have to put the y-numerator over the x-numerator, thus: tan60 3 1 . Multiply these three parts for your final answer: sin costan30 45 60 1 2 2 2 3 1 6 4 11 cos sin x x 2 . sec cos sin cos cos cos sin cos cossin x x x x x x x x x xxtan22 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 . Now, just cancel one of the cosines, and you’re done. 12 26 26 73 11 ,, , and . It’s generally difficult to deal with a trig equation with two different arguments (the x and the 2x), so you should try to do something to get rid of the 2x. The trig identity, sin 22xx xsincos , is the ticket. Make the substitution: cossin cos sincos xx xx x 20 20 Now factor by pulling out the GCF; then use the zero product property: cos sinxx12 0 cos x 0 or 12 0 21 1 2 sin sin sin x x x If you know the unit circle well (you should!), you know that cosine equals zero at 2 and 3 2 and that sine equals 1 2 at 7 6 and 11 6 . That’s a wrap. 112 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites 13 The x-coordinates of points on the unit circle tell you that cos01, cos90 0, cos180 1, cos270 0, and cos360 1. Starting with these five points, you can sketch one cycle of the sinusoidal shape of the cosine function. The cycle then repeats to the left and right. You should end up with a graph similar to the one in Figure 6-6. 14 sintan sinsin 11 11 1 2 30 3 3 1 2 30 1 2 radians radiians radianscos cos tan cos 11 11 1 2 120 10 145 00 2 radians CHAPTER 6 The Trig Tango 113 Whaddya Know?

The radius of the unit circle to the 300 point makes a 60 angle with the x-axis, so you’ve got a tall, narrow 30 60 90-- triangle in quad- rant IV. That can help you remember the coordinates at that point, because you know that the y-coordinate is “greater” than the x-coordinate (except that it’s negative). The coordinates at the 300 point are 1 2 3 2 , . Those coordinates give you the six answers you need. 2 cos sin tan 7 6 3 2 7 6 1 2 7 6 3 3 (the -numerator over y tthe -numerator, then rationalize) (the reci x sec 7 6 23 3 pprocal of cosine) (the reciprocal of sincsc 7 6 2 ee) (flip the tangent answer then rationalicot 7 6 3 zze) At the 7 6 point, you’ve got a wide, short 30 60 90-- triangle in quadrant III that makes a 30 angle with the x-axis.

The three answers to Part (a) are the three forms of the trig identity for cos 2 . CHAPTER 6 The Trig Tango 115 (a) 75 . Okay. So here’s a problem with the inverse function on the outside where the angle is not in the range of the inverse cosine function. What to do? First, consider where 435 is. You should be able to see that a 435 angle is in the proper location for the inverse cosine function (because it’s in quadrant I). It’s coterminal with a 75 angle, because 75 360 435 . Because 75 is in the range of the inverse cosine function, that’s your answer. (b) 170 . And here’s the third type of problem with the inverse function on the outside. This time, the angle, 190 , is not in the proper location for the inverse cosine function because it’s in quadrant III. For this situation, you need to find an angle that is in the proper span for inverse cosine and that has the same cosine answer as the cosine of 190 . Consider the unit circle. The cosine of an angle in the unit circle is the x-coordinate of the point on the unit circle where the angle meets the circle. Imagine where the 190 point is on the unit circle. It’s just below the x-axis in quadrant III. All you need to do is to reflect that point over the x-axis. That brings you to 170 , and that’s your answer. Another way to do this is to simply take the negative of the angle, 190 , which is in the proper location, because it’s in quadrant II. Then just add 360 to 190 (170 ) to produce a coterminal angle that’s in the correct span. 6 4 (a) 2 3 . When you have one of these problems with a trig function and the inverse of the same trig function — with the inverse function in the inside — the answer is right there. It’s automatic. (b) 2 3 . When the inverse function is on the outside like here, you’ve got to be careful. The answer to this particular problem, like with Part (a), is automatic. But this problem is automatic only because the given angle, namely 2 3 , is in the range of the inverse cosine function, 0, . When that’s not the case, you’ve got a little work to do. 5 (a) 3 . From the unit circle, you can see that angles of 30 and 210 have a sine equal to 1 2. The range of inverse sine is 90 90, , so sin 1 1 2 30 . Then the unit circle coordinates at 30 , namely 3 2 1 2 , , give you the cotangent answer of 3. (b) 90 . From the unit circle, tan225 1, and also from the unit circle, sin 1190 . That’s it. 116 UNIT 2 Warming Up with Calculus Prerequisites 7 f xx32sin has an amplitude 3 times the amplitude of the ordinary sine function and a period that’s half of the ordinary period. (That gives f xx32sin an amplitude of 3 and a period of .) From your knowledge of the transformation of functions, you should know that the 3 is a vertical stretch and that the 2 is a horizontal shrink. 8 3 26 5 6 ,, . This is a quadratic equation in sin . So, like with most quadratic equations, you should set this equal to zero: 2 10 2sinsin . Now factor: 21 10sinsin . The zero product property then gives you the two answers of sin 1 2 or sin 1. You can then find your final answers on the unit circle: you might notice that sine equals –1 at 2 , but that’s not in the given span, so you’ve got to be sure to give your answer as 3 2 . Sine equals 1 2 at 6 , so that’s another answer. And don’t forget about the third answer of 5 6 . 3 Limits In This Unit . . . CHAPTER 7: Limits and Continuity Take It to the Limit — NOT Linking Limits and Continuity The 33333 Limit Mnemonic Practice Questions Answers and Explanations Whaddya Know? Chapter 7 Quiz Answers to Chapter 7 Quiz CHAPTER 8: Evaluating Limits Easy Does It — Easy Limits The “Real Deal” Limit Problems Evaluating Limits at ±Infinity Practice Questions Answers and Explanations Whaddya Know? Chapter 8 Quiz Answers to Chapter 8 Quiz CHAPTER 7 Limits and Continuity 119 Limits and Continuity A s discussed in Chapter 3, you can use ordinary algebra and geometry when the things in a math or science problem aren’t changing (sort of) and when the graph of the function in question is a straight line. But you need calculus when things are changing — these changing things show up on graphs as curves. Calculus can handle such things by zooming in on the curves till they become straight (zooming in infinitely far, sort of). At that point, ordinary algebra and geometry can be used. Limits are the seemingly magical trick or tool that does this zooming-in process. It’s the mathematics of limits that makes calculus work. Limits are fundamental for both differential and integral calculus. The formal definition of a derivative involves a limit, as does the definition of a definite integral. (If you’re a real go-getter and can’t wait to read the actual definitions, check out Chapters 9 and 14.) Now, it turns out that after you learn the shortcuts for calculating derivatives and integrals, you won’t need to use the longer limit methods anymore. But understanding the mathematics of limits is nonetheless important because it forms the foundation upon which the vast architecture of calculus is built (okay, so I got a bit carried away there). In this chapter, I lay the groundwork for differentiation and integration by exploring limits and the closely related topic, continuity. Take It to the Limit — NOT Limits can be tricky. Don’t worry if you don’t grasp the concept right away. Informal definition of limit (the formal definition is in a few pages): The limit of a function (if it exists) for some x-value c is the height the function gets closer and closer to as x gets closer and closer to c from the left and the right. (Note: This definition does not apply to limits where x approaches infinity or negative infinity. More about those limits later in this chapter and in Chapter 8.) Chapter 7 IN THIS CHAPTER » Taking a look at limits » Evaluating functions with holes — break out the mothballs » Exploring continuity and discontinuity 120 UNIT 3 Limits Got it? You’re kidding! Let me say it another way. A function has a limit for a given x-value c if the function zeros in on some height as x gets closer and closer to the given value c from the left and the right. Did that help? I didn’t think so. It’s much easier to understand limits through examples than through this sort of mumbo jumbo, so let’s take a look at some. Using three functions to illustrate the same limit Consider the function fx x31, shown on the left in Figure 7-1. When we say that the limit of fx as x approaches 2 is 7, written as lim x fx 2 7, we mean that as x gets closer and closer to 2 from the left and the right, fx gets closer and closer to a height of 7. By the way, as far as I know, the number 2 in this example doesn’t have a formal name, but I call it the arrow-number. The arrow-number gives you a horizontal location in the x direction. Don’t confuse it with the answer to the limit problem, called the limit, which refers to a y-value or height of the function (7 in this example). Now, look at Table 7-1. Table  7-1 shows that y is approaching 7 as x approaches 2 from both the left and the right, and thus the limit is 7. If you’re wondering what all the fuss is about — why not just plug the number 2 into x in fx x31 and obtain the answer of 7 — I’m sure you’ve got a lot of com- pany. In fact, if all functions were continuous (without gaps) like f, you could just plug in the arrow-number to get the answer, and this type of limit problem would basically be pointless. You need to use limits in calculus because of discontinuous functions like g and h that have holes. FIGURE 7-1:  The graphs of the functions of f, g, and h. Table 7-1 Input and Output Values of f xx31 as x Approaches 2 CHAPTER 7 Limits and Continuity 121 Function g in the middle of Figure 7-1 is identical to f except for the hole at 2, 7 and the point at 2, 5 . Actually, this function, gx , would never come up in an ordinary calculus problem — I only use it to illustrate how limits work. (Keep reading. I have a bit more groundwork to lay before you see why I include it.) The important functions for calculus are the functions like h on the right in Figure 7-1, which come up frequently in the study of derivatives. This third function is identical to fx except that the point 2, 7 has been plucked out, leaving a hole at 2, 7 and no other point where x equals 2. Imagine what the table of input and output values would look like for gx and h x . Can you see that the values would be identical to the values in Table 7-1 for fx ? For both g and h, as x gets closer and closer to 2 from the left and the right, y gets closer and closer to a height of 7. For all three functions, the limit as x approaches 2 is 7. This brings me to a critical point: When determining the limit of a function as x approaches, say, 2, the value of f 2  — or even whether f 2 exists at all — is totally irrelevant. Take a look at all three functions again where xf22: equals 7, g 2 is 5, and h 2 doesn’t exist (or, as mathematicians say, it’s undefined). But, again, those three different results don’t affect the answers to the three limit problems — which all have the same answer. You never get to the arrow-number. In a limit problem, x gets closer and closer to the arrow- number c, but technically never gets there, and what happens to the function when x equals the arrow-number c has no effect on the answer to the limit problem (though for continuous func- tions like fx , the function value is the same as the limit answer). Sidling up to one-sided limits One-sided limits work like regular, two-sided limits except that x approaches the arrow- number c from just the left or just the right. The most important purpose for such limits is that they’re used in the formal definition of a regular limit (see the next section on the formal def- inition of a limit). To indicate a one-sided limit, you put a little superscript subtraction sign on the arrow- number when x approaches the arrow-number from the left, or a superscript addition sign when x approaches the arrow-number from the right. It looks like this: lim x fx 5 or lim x gx 0 Look at Figure 7-2. As x approaches 3 from the left, px zeros in on a height of 6, and when x approaches 3 from the right, px zeros in on a height of 2. As with regular limits, the value of p 3 has no effect on the answer to either of these one-sided limit problems. Thus, lim x px 3 6 and lim x px 3 2 The answer to the regular, two-sided limit problem, lim x px 3 , is that the limit does not exist because px is zeroing in on different heights as x approaches 3 from the left and from the right. 122 UNIT 3 Limits A function like px in Figure 7-2 is called a piecewise function because it’s got separate pieces. Each part of a piecewise function has its own equation  — like, for example, the following three-piece function: y xx xx xx 2 1 32 110 510 for for for Sometimes a chunk of a piecewise function connects with its neighboring chunk, in which case the function is continuous there. And sometimes, like with px , a piece does not connect with the adjacent piece; this results in a discontinuity. The formal definition of a limit — just what you’ve been waiting for Now that you know about one-sided limits, I can give you the formal mathematical definition of a limit. Here goes: Formal definition of limit: Let f be a function and let c be a real number. lim x c fx exists if and only if 1. lim x c fx exists, 2. lim x c fx exists, and 3. lim lim . x cx c fx fx Calculus books always present this as a three-part test for the existence of a limit, but condi- tion 3 is the only one you need to worry about because 1 and 2 are built into 3. You just have to remember that you can’t satisfy condition 3 if the left and right sides of the equation are both undefined or nonexistent; in other words, it is not true that undefined = undefined or that nonexistent = nonexistent. (I think this is why calc texts use the three-part definition.) As long as you’ve got that straight, condition 3 is all you need to check. When we say a limit exists, it means that the limit equals a finite number. Some limits equal infinity or negative infinity, but you nevertheless say that they do not exist. That may seem strange, but take my word for it. (More about infinite limits in the next section.) FIGURE 7-2:  p x : An illustration of two one-sided limits. CHAPTER 7 Limits and Continuity 123 Limits and vertical asymptotes A rational function like fx xx xx 25 31 has vertical asymptotes at x 3 and x 1. Remember asymptotes? They’re imaginary lines that the graph of a function gets closer and closer to as it goes up, down, left, or right toward infinity or negative infinity. The function fx is shown in Figure 7-3. Consider the limit of the function in Figure 7-3 as x approaches 3. As x approaches 3 from the left, fx goes up to infinity, and as x approaches 3 from the right, fx goes down to negative infinity. Sometimes it’s informative to indicate this by writing the following: lim x fx 3 and lim x fx 3 But it’s also correct to say that both of these limits do not exist because infinity is not a real number. If you’re asked to determine the regular, two-sided limit, lim x fx 3 , you have no choice but to say that it does not exist because the limits from the left and from the right are not equal. Limits and horizontal asymptotes Up till now, I’ve been looking at limits where x approaches a regular, finite number. But x can also approach infinity or negative infinity. Limits at infinity exist when a function has a hori- zontal asymptote. For example, the function in Figure 7-3 has a horizontal asymptote at y 1, which the function gets closer and closer to as it goes toward infinity to the right and negative infinity to the left. (Going left, the function crosses and goes above the horizontal asymptote at x 7 (not shown in Figure 7-3) and then gradually comes down toward the asymptote. Going right, the function stays below the asymptote and gradually rises up toward it.) The limits equal the height of the horizontal asymptote and are written as lim x fx 1 and lim x fx 1 You see more limits at infinity in Chapter 8. FIGURE 7-3:  A typical rational function. 124 UNIT 3 Limits Use Figure 7-4 for the example problems and for Problems 1 through 6. Q. lim x fx 0 ? A. lim x fx 0 2. Because f 02 and because f is continuous there, the limit must equal the function value. Whenever a function passes through a point and there’s no disconti- nuity at that point, the limit equals the function value. Q. lim x fx 13 ? A. lim x fx 13 2. There’s a hole at 13 2, , and the limit at a hole is the height of the hole. 1 lim x fx 7 ? 3 lim x fx 5 ? 4 lim x fx 18 ? 2 (a) f 5 ? (b) f 18 ? FIGURE 7-4:  Not exactly your everyday graph.

Sketch by hand the function fx x x ; then refer to your sketch for Problems 8, 9, and 10. 8 lim x 0 fx ? 126 UNIT 3 Limits Calculating instantaneous speed with limits If you’ve been dozing up to now, WAKE UP! The following problem, which eventually turns out to be a limit problem, brings you to the threshold of real calculus. Say you and your calculus- loving cat are hanging out one day and you decide to drop a ball out of your second-story window. Here’s the formula that tells you how far the ball has dropped after a given number of seconds (ignoring air resistance): h tt16 2 (where h is the height the ball has fallen, in feet, and t is the amount of time since the ball was dropped, in seconds) If you plug 1 into t, h is 16; so, the ball falls 16 feet during the first second. During the first 2 seconds, it falls a total of 16 22, or 64 feet, and so on. Now, what if you wanted to determine the ball’s speed exactly 1 second after you dropped it? You can start by whipping out this trusty ol’ formula: Dis ce rate timetan so Rate disce time tan . Using the rate (or speed) formula, you can easily figure out the ball’s average speed during the 2nd second of its fall. Because it dropped 16 feet after 1 second and a total of 64 feet after 2 seconds, it fell 6416, or 48 feet from t 1 second to t 2 seconds. The following formula gives you the average speed: Averagespeed totaldistance totaltime 64 16 21 48 feet per seecond 9 lim x fx 0 ? 10 lim x fx 0 ? CHAPTER 7 Limits and Continuity 127 But this isn’t the answer you want because the ball falls faster and faster as it drops, and you want to know its speed exactly 1 second after you drop it. The ball speeds up between 1 and 2 seconds, so this average speed of 48 feet per second during the 2nd second is certain to be faster than the ball’s instantaneous speed at the end of the 1st second. For a better approximation, calculate the average speed between t 1 second and t 15. seconds. After 1.5 seconds, the ball has fallen 16 152., or 36 feet, so from t 1 to t 15., it falls 36 16, or 20 feet. Its average speed is thus Averagespeed 36 16 15 1 40 . feet per second If you continue this process for elapsed times of a quarter of a second, a tenth of a second, then a hundredth, a thousandth, and a ten-thousandth of a second, you arrive at the list of average speeds shown in Table 7-2. As t gets closer and closer to 1 second, the average speeds appear to get closer and closer to 32 feet per second. Here’s the formula I used to generate the numbers in Table 7-2. It gives you the average speed between 1 second and t seconds: Averagespeed t t t ttt t t 16 16 1 1 16 1 1 16 11 1 16 22 2 16 1(where t ) (In the last line of the solution, recall that t cannot equal 1 because that would result in a zero in the denominator of the original equation. This restriction remains in effect even after you cancel the t 1.) Figure 7-5 shows the graph of this function. This graph is identical to the graph of the line y t16 16 except for the hole at 1, 32 . There’s a hole there because if you plug 1 into t in the average speed function, you get Averagespeed 16 11 11 0 0 2 Table 7-2 Average Speeds from 1 Second to t Seconds 128 UNIT 3 Limits which is undefined. And why do you get 0 0? Because you’re trying to determine an average speed — which equals total distance divided by elapsed time — from t 1 to t 1. But from t 1 to t 1 is, of course, no time, and “during” this point in time, the ball doesn’t travel any distance, so you get zero feet zero seconds as the average speed from t 1 to t 1. Obviously, there’s a problem here. Hold on to your hat, you’ve arrived at one of the big “Ah ha!” moments in the development of differential calculus. Definition of instantaneous speed: Instantaneous speed is defined as the limit of the average speed as the elapsed time approaches zero. For the falling-ball problem, you’d have Instantaneousspeed t t t t t t at second1 1 2 1 16 1 1 16 lim lim 111 1 16 16 32 1 t t t t lim feet per second The fact that the elapsed time never gets to zero doesn’t affect the precision of the answer to this limit problem  — the answer is exactly 32 feet per second, the height of the hole in Figure  7-4. What’s remarkable about limits is that they enable you to calculate the precise, instantaneous speed at a single point in time by taking the limit of a function that’s based on an elapsed time, a period between two points of time. FIGURE 7-5:  The function ft gives you the average speed between 1 second and t seconds. CHAPTER 7 Limits and Continuity 129 Linking Limits and Continuity Before I expand on the material on limits from the earlier sections of this chapter, I want to introduce a related idea — continuity. This is such a simple concept. A continuous function is simply a function with no gaps — a function that you can draw without taking your pencil off the paper. Consider the four functions shown in Figure 7-6. Whether or not a function is continuous is almost always obvious. The first two functions in Figure 7-6, fx and gx , have no gaps, so they’re continuous. The next two, px and q x , have gaps at x 3, so they’re not continuous. That’s all there is to it. Well, not quite. The two functions with gaps are not continuous everywhere, but because you can draw sections of them without taking your pencil off the paper, you can say that parts of those functions are continuous. And sometimes a function is continuous everywhere it’s defined. Such a function is described as being continuous over its entire domain, which means that its gap or gaps occur at x-values where the function is undefined. The function px is continuous over its entire domain; q x , on the other hand, is not continuous over its entire domain because it’s not continuous at x 3, which is in the function’s domain. Often, the important issue is whether a function is continuous at a particular x-value. It is unless there’s a gap there. Continuity of polynomial functions: All polynomial functions are continuous everywhere. Continuity of rational functions: All rational functions (a rational function is the quotient of two polynomial functions) are continuous over their entire domains. They are discontinuous at x-values not in their domains — that is, x-values where the denominator is zero. FIGURE 7-6:  The graphs of the functions f, g, p, and q. 130 UNIT 3 Limits Continuity and limits usually go hand in hand Look at the four functions in Figure 7-6 where x 3. Consider whether each function is con- tinuous there and whether a limit exists at that x-value. The first two, f and g, have no gaps at x 3, so they’re continuous there. Both functions also have limits at x 3, and in both cases, the limit equals the height of the function at x 3, because as x gets closer and closer to 3 from the left and the right, y gets closer and closer to f 3 and g 3 , respectively. Functions p and q, on the other hand, are not continuous at x 3 (or you can say that they’re discontinuous there), and neither has a regular, two-sided limit at x 3. For both functions, the gaps at x 3 not only break the continuity, but they also cause no limits to be there because, as you move toward x 3 from the left and the right, you do not zero in on some single y-value. So there you have it. If a function is continuous at an x-value, there must be a regular, two- sided limit for that x-value. And if there’s a discontinuity at an x-value, there’s no two-sided limit there . . . well, almost. Keep reading for the exception. The hole exception tells the whole story The hole exception is the only exception to the rule that continuity and limits go hand in hand, but it’s a huge exception. And, I have to admit, it’s a bit odd for me to say that continuity and limits usually go hand in hand and to talk about this exception because the exception is the whole point. When you come right down to it, the exception is more important than the rule. Consider the two functions shown in Figure 7-7. These functions have gaps at x 2 and are obviously not continuous there, but they do have limits as x approaches 2. In each case, the limit equals the height of the hole. The hole exception: The only way a function can have a regular, two-sided limit where it is not continuous is where the discontinuity is an infinitesimal hole in the function. So, both functions in Figure 7-7 have the same limit as x approaches 2; the limit is 4, and the facts that r 21 and that s 2 is undefined are irrelevant. For both functions, as x zeros in on 2 from either side, the height of the function zeros in on the height of the hole — that’s the limit. This bears repeating: The limit at a hole: The limit at a hole is the height of the hole. FIGURE 7-7:  The graphs of the functions r and s. CHAPTER 7 Limits and Continuity 131 “That’s great,” you may be thinking. “But why should I care?” Well, stick with me for just a minute. In the falling ball example in the section, “Calculating instantaneous speed with lim- its,” earlier in this chapter, I tried to calculate the average speed during zero elapsed time. This gave me zero distance zero time . Because 0 0 is undefined, the result was a hole in the function. Function holes often come about from the impossibility of dividing zero by zero. It’s these functions where the limit process is critical, and such functions are at the heart of the meaning of a derivative, and derivatives are at the heart of differential calculus. The derivative-hole connection: A derivative always involves the undefined fraction 0 0 and always involves the limit of a function with a hole. (If you’re curious, all the limits in Chapter 9 — where the derivative is formally defined — are limits of functions with holes.) Sorting out the mathematical mumbo jumbo of continuity All you need to know to fully understand the idea of continuity is that a function is continuous at some particular x-value if there is no gap there. However, because you might be tested on the following formal definition, I suppose you’ll want to know it. Definition of continuity: A function fx is continuous at a point xa if the following three conditions are satisfied: 1. fa is defined, 2. lim x a fx exists, and 3. fa fx xa lim . Just like with the formal definition of a limit, the definition of continuity is always presented as a three-part test, but condition 3 is the only one you really need to worry about because con- ditions 1 and 2 are built into 3. You must remember, however, that condition 3 is not satisfied when the left and right sides of the equation are both undefined or nonexistent. The 33333 Limit Mnemonic Here’s a great memory device that pulls a lot of information together in one fell swoop. It may seem contrived or silly, but with mnemonic devices, contrived and silly work. The 33333 limit mnemonic helps you remember five groups of three things: two groups involving limits, two involving continuity, and one about derivatives. (I realize I haven’t gotten to derivatives yet, but this is the best place to present this mnemonic. Take my word for it — nothing’s perfect.) First, note that the word limit has five letters and that there are five 3’s in this mnemonic. Next, write limit with a lowercase “l” and uncross the “t” so it becomes another “l” — like this: l i m i l 132 UNIT 3 Limits Now, the two “l”s are for limits, the two “i”s are for continuity (notice that the letter “i” has a gap in it, thus it’s not continuous), and the “m” is for slope (remember y mx b ?), which is what derivatives are all about (you’ll see that in Chapter 9 in just a few pages). Each of the five letters helps you remember three things — like this: li mi l 33 33 3 » 3 parts to the definition of a limit: Look back to the definition of a limit in the section, “The formal definition of a limit — just what you’ve been waiting for.” Remembering that it has three parts helps you remember the parts — trust me. » 3 cases where a limit fails to exist: • At a vertical asymptote — called an infinite discontinuity — like at x 3 on function p in Figure 7-6. • At a jump discontinuity, like where x 3 on function q in Figure 7-6. • With a limit at infinity of an oscillating function like sin x, which goes up and down forever, never zeroing in on a single height. » 3 parts to the definition of continuity: Just as with the definition of a limit, remembering that the definition of continuity has 3 parts helps you remember the 3 parts (see the section, “Sorting out the mathematical mumbo jumbo of continuity”). » 3 types of discontinuity: • A removable discontinuity — that’s a fancy term for a hole — like the holes in functions r and s in Figure 7-7. • An infinite discontinuity like at x 3 on function p in Figure 7-6. • A jump discontinuity like at x 3 on function q in Figure 7-6. Note that the three types of discontinuity (hole, infinite, and jump) begin with three consec- utive letters of the alphabet. Since they’re consecutive, there are no gaps between h, i, and j, so they’re “continuous” letters. Hey, was this book worth the price or what? » 3 cases where a derivative fails to exist (I explain this in Chapter 9): • At any type of discontinuity. • At a sharp point on a function, namely, at a cusp or a corner. • At a vertical tangent (because the slope is undefined there). Well, there you have it. Did you notice that another way this mnemonic works is that it gives you 3 cases where a limit fails to exist, 3 cases where continuity fails to exist, and 3 cases where a derivative fails to exist? Holy triple trio of nonexistence, Batman, that’s yet another 3 — the 3 topics of the mnemonic: limits, continuity, and derivatives! CHAPTER 7 Limits and Continuity 133 Use Figure 7-8 for the example problem and for Problems 11 through 15. Q. List the x-coordinates of all discontinuities of the function, state whether the disconti- nuities are removable or nonremovable, and give the type of discontinuity — hole, jump, or infinite. A. At x 2 and x 5, the vertical asymptotes are nonremovable, infinite discontinuities. At x 2, x 6, and x 11, there are nonremovable, jump discontinuities. At x 8 and x 10, there are holes; holes are removable discontinuities. Though infinitely small, these are nevertheless discontinuities. They’re “removable” discontinuities because you can “fix” the function by plugging the holes. FIGURE 7-8:  Graphus interruptus: A function with many discontinuities. 11 At which of the following x-values are all three requirements for the existence of a limit satisfied, and what is the limit at those x-values? x 202 45 68 10 11,,, ,,, ,, and . 12 For the x-values at which all three limit requirements are not met, state which of the three requirements are not satisfied.

See the following graph. CHAPTER 7 Limits and Continuity 135 (a) f 54, the height of the solid dot at x 5. (b) f 18 is undefined because f has no y-value corresponding to the x-value of 18. After reviewing the following solutions to Problems 3 through 6, reflect on how the answers to those problems compare to the answers to Problem 2. 3 lim x fx 5 does not exist. The limit does not exist because the limit from the left does not equal the limit from the right. Or, you could say that the limit DNE because there’s a jump discontinuity at x 5. 4 lim x fx 18 5. Like the second example problem, the limit at a hole is the height of the hole. The fact that f 18 is undefined is irrelevant to this limit question. 5 lim x fx 5 4. The limit is 4 because f 54 and f is continuous from the left at 54, . 6 lim x fx 5 6. This question is just like Problem 5, except that there’s a hollow dot — instead of a solid one — when you arrive at the gap. But the hollow dot at 56, is irrelevant to the limit question — just as in Problem 4, where the hole was irrelevant. 7 lim x x 1 0. As you go out farther and farther to the right, the function gets closer and closer to zero, so that’s the limit. 8 lim x fx 0 1. Of course, you can graph f with your graphing calculator, but it’s a good idea to graph func- tions by hand now and then. It helps you understand why the function looks the way it does. All you need to do to sketch this one by hand is to plug a few negative and positive numbers into x. You’ll soon see that whenever the input is negative, the output is –1, and whenever the input is positive, the output is 1. And you need the hollow dots on the y-axis at –1 and 1 because f 0 is undefined. Your sketch should look something like the following figure. Practice Questions Answers and Explanations 1 lim x fx 7 does not exist (DNE) because there’s a vertical asymptote at –7. Or, because fx approaches negative infinity both from the left and from the right, you could say the limit equals negative infinity. 2 136 UNIT 3 Limits For the one-sided limit, lim x fx 0 , nothing to the right of zero is relevant. And, as with all limit problems, what actually happens to the function (namely, whether it exists and, if it exists, what it equals) when x gets to the limit number doesn’t affect the limit answer. All that matters is what’s happening to the function as x gets closer and closer to the limit number. As x gets closer and closer to zero from the left, y is staying precisely at –1, so that’s the limit. 9 lim x fx 0 1. See the solution to Problem 8. The limit in this problem works exactly the same way. 10 lim x fx 0 does not exist. As you see in the solutions to Problems 8 and 9, lim lim x x fx fx 00 , and, therefore, the ordinary, two-sided limit does not exist. 11 At 0, the limit is 2; at 4, the limit is 5; at 8, the limit is 3; at 10, the limit is 5. A limit exists at a particular x-value of a curve when the curve is heading toward some particular y-value and keeps heading toward that y-value as you continue to zoom in on the curve at the x-value. The curve must head toward that y-value (that height) as you move along the curve both from the right and from the left (unless the limit is one where x approaches infinity). I emphasize heading toward because what happens precisely at the given x-value isn’t relevant to this limit inquiry. That’s why there is a limit at a hole like the ones at x 8 and x 10. 12 At –2 and 5, all three conditions fail. At 2, 6, and 11, only the third requirement is not satisfied. At 2, the limit from the left equals 5 and the limit from the right equals 3. At 6, the limit from the left is 2 and the limit from the right is 3. Finally, at 11, the limit from the left equals 3 and the limit from the right equals 5. 13 The function in Figure 7-8 is continuous at 0 and 4. The common-sense way of thinking about continuity is that a curve is continuous wherever you can draw the curve without taking your pen off the paper. It should be obvious that that’s true at 0 and 4, but not at any of the other listed x-values. 14 All listed x-values other than 0 and 4 are points of discontinuity. A discontinuity is just a highfalutin calculus way of saying a gap. If you have to take your pen off the paper at some point when drawing a curve, then the curve has a discontinuity there. At 5 and 11, all three conditions fail. At –2, 2, and 6, continuity requirements 2 and 3 are not satisfied. At 10, requirements 1 and 3 are not satisfied. At 8, requirement 3 is not satisfied. 15 lim sin x x does not exist. There’s no limit as x approaches infinity because the curve oscillates — it never settles down to one precise y-value. (The three-part definition of a limit does not apply to limits at infinity.) If you’re ready to test your skills a bit more, take the following chapter quiz that incorporates all the chapter topics.

At 0, all three conditions fail. At 1, conditions 2 and 3 fail. At 3, all three conditions fail. CHAPTER 8 Evaluating Limits 141 Evaluating Limits C hapter 7 introduces the concept of a limit and goes over the theoretical limit stuff. This chapter gets down to the nitty-gritty techniques for calculating the answers to limit problems. Here you practice two main methods for solving limit problems: using your calculator and using algebra. The calculator techniques are useful for a few reasons: 1) You can solve some limit problems on your calculator that are either impossible or just very difficult to do with algebra, 2) You can check your algebraic answers with your calculator, and 3) Limit problems can be solved with a calculator when you’re not required to show your work — like maybe on a multiple-choice test. (Of course, depending on your teacher and depending on the situation, you may not be allowed to use your calculator.) Learning the algebraic techniques is valuable for a couple reasons: The first, incredibly impor- tant reason is that the mathematics involved in the algebraic methods is beautiful, pure, and rigorous; and, second — something so trivial that perhaps I shouldn’t mention it — you’ll be tested on it. Do I have my priorities straight or what? Easy Does It — Easy Limits Before getting to the algebraic and calculator techniques, let’s dispense with some really easy limit problems. A few limit problems are very easy. They’re so easy that I don’t have to waste your time with unnecessary introductory remarks and unneeded words that take up space and do nothing to Chapter 8 IN THIS CHAPTER » Algebra, schmalgebra » Calculators — taking the easy way out » Making limit sandwiches » Infinity — “Are we there yet?” » Conjugate multiplication — sounds R rated, but it’s strictly PG 142 UNIT 3 Limits further your knowledge of the subject — instead, I can just cut to the chase and give you only the critical facts and get to the point and get down to business and . . . Okay, so are you ready? Limits to memorize You should memorize the following limits. If you fail to memorize the limits in the last four bullets, you could waste a lot of time trying to figure them out. » lim x a cc (y c is a horizontal line, so the limit — which is the function height — must equal c regardless of the arrow-number.) » lim x x0 1 » lim x x0 1 » lim x x 1 0 » lim x x 1 0 » lim sin lim sinx x x x x x00 1 » lim cos x x x0 1 0 » lim. x x x e1 1 2 718 » lim. x x xe 1 11 0 368 Plugging and chugging Plug-and-chug problems make up the second category of easy limits. Just plug the arrow- number into the limit function, and if the computation results in a number, that’s your answer (but see the following warning). For example, lim x x 3 2 10 1 (Don’t forget that for this method to work, the result you get after plugging in must be an ordi- nary number, not infinity or negative infinity or something that’s undefined.) If you’re dealing with a function that’s continuous everywhere (like the one in this example) or a function that’s continuous over its entire domain, this method will always work. These are well-duh limit problems, and, to be perfectly frank, there’s really no point to them. The limit is simply the function value. If you’re dealing with any other type of function, this method will only work sometimes — read on. CHAPTER 8 Evaluating Limits 143 Beware of discontinuities. The plug-and-chug method works for any type of function, includ- ing piecewise functions, unless there’s a discontinuity at the arrow-number you plug in. In that case, if you get a number after plugging in, that number is not the limit; the limit might equal some other number or it might not exist. (See Chapter 7 for a description of piecewise functions.) What happens when plugging in gives you a non-zero number over zero? If you plug the arrow-number into a limit like lim x x5 105 and you get any number (other than zero) divided by zero — like 10 0  — then you know that the limit does not exist; in other words, the limit does not equal a finite number. (The answer might be infinity or negative infinity or just a plain old “does not exist.”) The “Real Deal” Limit Problems When you tackle any limit problem, you should always begin by plugging the arrow-number into the limit expression. Sometimes (not often), your answer will be an ordinary number or a non-zero number over zero, and you’ll be done  — as explained in the preceding section (though make sure you heed the warning). But if you plug in the arrow-number and the result is undefined (excluding the case covered in the previous tip), you’ve got a “for real” limit problem  — and a bit of work to do. This is the main focus of this chapter. These are the interesting limit problems, the ones that likely have infinitesimal holes, and the ones that are important for differential calculus — you see more of them in Chapter 9. With these real-deal limit problems (where plugging in often gives you 0 0), you can try four things: your calculator, general algebraic techniques, making a limit sandwich (a special alge- braic technique), and L’Hôpital’s rule (which is covered in Chapter 18). Figuring a limit with your calculator Your calculator is a great tool for understanding limits. It can often give you a better feel for how a limit works than the algebraic techniques can. A limit problem asks you to determine what the y-value of a function is zeroing in on as the x-value approaches a particular number. With your calculator, you can actually witness the process and the result. Say you want to eval- uate the following limit: lim x x x5 2 25 5 . The plug-and-chug method doesn’t work because plug- ging 5 into x produces the undefined result of 0 0. Let’s solve this limit problem with a calculator. I’ll go over two basic methods. A note about calculators and other technology: With every passing year, there are more and more powerful calculators and more and more resources on the Internet that can do calculus for you. One thing that allows these technologies to do calculus is that they can handle algebra (using CAS, a Computer Algebra System). Say you input xx32 5 . These technologies can FOIL that expression and give you the algebraic answer of 2 15 2xx . A calculator like the TI-Nspire, or any other calculator with CAS, or websites like Wolfram Alpha (www.wolfram alpha.com), can actually do the above limit problem, and all sorts of more difficult calculus problems, and give you the exact numerical or algebraic answer. 144 UNIT 3 Limits Older calculator models can’t do algebra or calculus in the real, precise, algebraic way. They can, however, give you approximate answers to calc problems — which will often suffice. Different calculus teachers have different policies on what technology they allow in their classes. Many do not allow the use of CAS calculators and comparable technologies because they basically do all the calculus work for you. So, the following discussion (and the rest of this book) assumes you’re using a more basic calculator (like the TI-84) without CAS capability. Method one The first calculator method is to test the limit function with two numbers: one slightly less than the arrow-number and one slightly more than it. So, here’s what you do for the earlier prob- lem, lim x x x5 2 25 5 . If you have a calculator like a Texas Instruments TI-84, enter the first num- ber, say 4.9999, on the home screen, and press the Sto (store) button, then the x button, and then the Enter button (this stores the number into x). Then enter the function, x x 2 25 5 , and hit Enter. The result, 9.9999, is extremely close to a round number, 10, so 10 is likely your answer. Now take a number a little higher than the arrow-number, like 5.0001, and repeat the process. Since the result, 10.0001, is also very close to 10, that clinches it. The answer is 10 (almost cer- tainly). (By the way, if you’re using a different calculator model, you can likely achieve the same result with the same technique or something very close to it.) This method can be effec- tive, but it often doesn’t give you a good feel for how the y-values zero in on the result. To get a better picture of this process, you can store three or four numbers into x (one after another), each a bit closer to the arrow-number, and look at the sequence of results. Method two The second calculator method is to set y equal to the limit expression and enter it in your calcu- lator’s graphing mode. You can then investigate the limit problem on your calculator by 1) look- ing at the table of values and 2) viewing the graph of the function. Let’s do it. Enter y x x 2 25 5 in graphing mode on your calculator. Then go to Table Setup and enter the arrow-number, 5, as the TblStart number; then, enter a small number, say 0.001, for Tbl — that’s the size of the x-increments in the table. Hit the Table button to produce the table. Now scroll up until you can see a couple of numbers less than 5, and you should see a table of values similar to the one in Table 8-1. Table 8-1 TI-84 Table for y x x 2 25 5 after Scrolling Up to 4.998 x y 4.998 9.998 4.999 9.999 5 error 5.001 10.001 5.002 10.002 5.003 10.003 CHAPTER 8 Evaluating Limits 145 Because y gets very close to 10 as x zeros in on 5 from above and below, 10 is the limit (almost certainly . . . you can’t be absolutely positive with these calculator methods, but they almost always work). Next, take a look at the graph of this function. Go into the window and tweak the Xmin, Xmax, Ymin, and Ymax settings, if necessary, so that the part of the function corresponding to the arrow- number is within the viewing window. Now, use the trace feature to trace along the function until you get close to the arrow-number. You can’t trace exactly onto the arrow-number because there’s a little hole in the function there, the height of which, by the way, is your answer. When you trace close to the arrow-number, the y-value will get close to the limit answer. Use the ZoomBox fea- ture to draw a little box around the part of the graph containing the arrow-number, and zoom in until you see that the y-values are getting very close to a round number — that’s your answer. These calculator techniques are useful for a number of reasons. Your calculator can give you the answers to limit problems that are impossible to do algebraically. And it can solve limit prob- lems that you could do with paper and pencil except that you’re stumped. Also, for problems that you do solve on paper, you can use your calculator to check your answers. And even when you choose to solve a limit algebraically — or are required to do so — it’s a good idea to cre- ate a table like Table 8-1 not just to confirm your answer, but to see how the function behaves near the arrow-number. This gives you a numerical grasp on the problem, which enhances your algebraic understanding of it. If you then look at the graph of the function on your calculator, you have a third, graphical or visual way of thinking about the problem. Many calculus problems can be done algebraically, graphically, and numerically. When possible, use two or three of the approaches. Each approach gives you a different perspective on a prob- lem and enhances your grasp of the relevant concepts. Use the calculator methods to supplement algebraic methods, but don’t rely too much on them. First of all, the non-CAS-calculator techniques won’t allow you to deduce an exact answer unless the numbers your calculator gives you are getting close to a number you recognize. If your calculator gives you 9.999, for example, you can be pretty sure the exact answer is 10, and you can be quite confident that the exact answer is 1 3 if your calculator says 0.333332. And per- haps you recognize that 1.414211 is very close to 2 . But if the exact answer to a limit problem is something like 1 23 , you probably won’t recognize it. The number 1 23 is approximately equal to 0.288675. When you see numbers on your calculator close to that decimal, you won’t rec- ognize 1 23 as the limit — unless you’re an Archimedes, a Gauss, or a Ramanujan (members of the mathematics hall of fame). However, even when you don’t recognize the exact answer in such cases, you can still learn an approximate answer, in decimal form, to the limit question, and that can be helpful. Gnarly functions may stump your calculator. Another calculator limitation is that it won’t work at all with some peculiar functions. Consider, for example, lim sin x x x5 25 5 1 5 . This limit equals zero, but you can’t get that result with your calculator. By the way, even when the non-CAS-calculator methods work, these calculators can do some quirky things from time to time. For example, if you’re solving a limit problem where x approaches 3, and you put numbers in your calculator that are too close to 3 (like 3.0000000001), you can get too close to the calculator’s maximum decimal length. This can result in answers that get further from the limit answer, even as you input numbers closer and closer to the arrow-number. 146 UNIT 3 Limits The moral of the story is that you should think of your calculator as one of several tools at your disposal for solving limits — not as a foolproof substitute for algebraic techniques. Q. Evaluate lim x xx x6 2 56 6sin . A. The answer is 7. Method One: 1. Use the Sto button to store 5.99 into x. 2. Enter xx x 2 56 6sin on the home screen and hit Enter. (Note: You must be in radian mode.) This gives you a result of ~ .,699 suggesting that the answer is 7. 3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 with 5.999 stored into x. This gives you a result of ~ .6 999 (even closer to 7). 4. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 with 6.01 stored into x. This gives you a result of ~ .701 (close to 7 again). 5. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 with 6.001. This gives you a result of ~ .7 001 (even closer). Because the results are obviously homing in on the round number of 7, that’s your answer. Method Two: 1. Enter xx x 2 56 6sin in graphing or “y =” mode. 2. Go to Table Setup and set TblStart to the arrow-number, 6, and ΔTbl to 0.01. 3. Go to the Table, and you’ll see the y-values getting closer and closer to 7 as you scroll toward x 6 from above and below 6. So 7 is your answer. 4. Graph the function. For expressions containing trig functions, ZoomStd, ZoomFit, and ZoomTrig are good windows to try for your first viewing. For this funny function, none of these three window options works very well, but ZoomStd is the best. 5. Trace close to x 6 and you’ll see that y is near 7. Use ZoomBox to draw a little box around the point 67, ; then hit Enter. 6. Trace near x 6 on this zoomed-in graph until you get very near to x 6. 7. Repeat the Zoombox process maybe two more times and you should be able to trace extremely close to x 6. (When I did this, I could trace to x 6 0000022. , y 7 0000023. .) The answer is 7. CHAPTER 8 Evaluating Limits 147 1 Use your calculator to evaluate lim x xx x3 2 524 3 . Try both methods. 2 Use your calculator to determine lim tanx x x0 1 sin . Use both methods. Solving limit problems with algebra Don’t forget to plug in! You can solve limit problems with several algebraic techniques (dis- cussed next). But before you try any algebra, your first step should always be to plug the arrow- number into the limit expression. If the function is continuous at the arrow-number and if plugging in results in an ordinary number, then that’s the answer. You’re done. For example, to evaluate lim x x x5 2 10, just plug in the arrow-number. You get 510 5 3 2 . That’s all there is to it. You’re also done if plugging in the arrow-number gives you a number or infinity or negative infinity over zero, like 3 0 , or 0 ; in these cases the limit does not exist (DNE). When plugging in fails because it gives you 0 0, you’ve got a nontrivial limit problem and a bit of work to do. You have to convert the fraction into some expression where plugging in does work (it works because the algebra you do plugs an infinitesimal hole in the function where x equals the arrow-number). Here are some algebraic methods you can try: » FOILing » Factoring » Finding the least common denominator » Canceling » Simplification » Conjugate multiplication 148 UNIT 3 Limits A couple of these methods are illustrated in the following examples. You’ll practice all the methods in the practice problems. Here’s a factoring example. Q. Evaluate lim x x x5 2 25 5 , the same problem you did with a calculator in the preceding section. A. The limit is 10. 1. Try plugging 5 into x — you should always try substitution first. You get 0 0 — no good, on to plan B. 2. x 2 25 can be factored, so do it. lim lim x x x x xx x5 2 5 25 5 55 5 3. Cancel the x 5 from the numerator and denominator. lim x x 5 5 4. Now substitution will work. 55 10 So, lim x x x5 2 25 5 10, confirming the calculator answer. By the way, the function you got after canceling the x 5 , namely y x 5 , is identical to the original function, y x x 2 25 5 , except that the hole in the original function at 510, has been plugged. And note that the limit as x approaches 5 is 10, which is the height of the hole at 510, . Try conjugate multiplication for fraction functions that contain square roots. Conjugate multi- plication rationalizes the numerator or denominator of a fraction, which means getting rid of square roots. Q. Evaluate lim x x x4 2 4 . A. The limit is 1 4 . 1. Try substitution. Plug in 4: That gives you 0 0 — time for plan B. CHAPTER 8 Evaluating Limits 149 2. Multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of x 2, which is x 2. Definition of conjugate: The conjugate of a two-term expression is just the same expression with subtraction switched to addition or vice versa. The product of con- jugates always equals the first term squared minus the second term squared. Now do the rationalizing. lim lim lim x x x x x x x x x x xx 4 4 4 2 2 2 4 2 4 2 2 2 4 22 4 424 lim x x xx 3. Cancel the x 4 from the numerator and denominator. lim x x4 1 2 4. Now substitution works. 1 42 1 4 So, lim x x x4 2 4 1 4. As with the factoring example, this rationalizing process plugged the hole in the original function. In this example, 4 is the arrow-number, 1 4 is the limit answer, and the function x x 2 4 has a hole at 4 1 4 , . When factoring and conjugate multiplication don’t work, try some other basic algebra, like adding or subtracting fractions, multiplying or dividing fractions, canceling, or some other form of simplification. Here’s an example: Q. Evaluate lim x x x0 1 4 1 4 . A. The limit is 1 16 . 1. Try substitution. Plug in 0: That gives you 0 0 — no good. 150 UNIT 3 Limits 2. Simplify the complex fraction (that’s a big fraction that contains little fractions) by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the least common denominator of the little fractions, namely 4 x 4 . Note: You can also simplify a complex fraction by adding or subtracting the little fractions in the numerator and/or denominator, but the method described here is a bit quicker. lim lim lim x x x x x x x x x 0 0 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 44 44 0 0 0 44 44 44 1 44 x xx x xx x x x lim lim 3.

The basic idea is to find one function that’s always less than or equal to the limit function (at least near the arrow-number) and another function that’s always greater than or equal to the limit function. Both of your new functions must have the same limit as x approaches the arrow-number. Then, because the limit function is “sand- wiched” between the other two, like salami between slices of bread, it must have that same limit as well. Consider Figure 8-1. Function f is sandwiched between B (for bottom) and T (for top). Because near the arrow-number of 2, f is always higher than or the same height as B and always lower than or the same height as T, and because lim lim x x Bx Tx 22 , fx must have the same limit as x approaches 2 because f is squeezed between B and T. The limit of both B and T as x approaches 2 is 3. So, 3 has to be the limit of f as well. It’s got nowhere else to go. Q. Evaluate limsin x x x0 1 . A. The limit is zero. 1. Try substitution. Plug 0 into x. That gives you 0 1 0 sin  — no good; this is undefined. On to plan B. 2. Try the ordinary algebraic methods from the last section. Knock yourself out. You can’t do it. Plan C. 3. Try your calculator. It’s always a good idea to see what your calculator tells you even if this is a “show your work” problem. To graph this function, set your graphing calculator’s mode to radian and the window to Xmin Xmax Ymin Ymax 04 04 03 03 . . . . FIGURE 8-1:  A limit sandwich — functions B and T are the bread and f is the salami. 154 UNIT 3 Limits Figure 8-2 shows what the graph looks like. It definitely looks like the limit of f is zero as x approaches zero from the left and the right. Now, check the table of values on your calculator (set TblStart to zero and Tbl to 0.001). Table 8-2 gives some of the values from the calculator table. These numbers sort of look like they’re getting closer and closer to zero as x gets close to zero, but they’re not convincing. This type of table doesn’t work so great for oscillating functions like sine or cosine. (Some function values on the table, for example 0 000969. for x 0 006. , are closer to zero than other values higher on the table where x is smaller. That’s the opposite of what you want to see. And you’ll run into the same problem if you look at small negative values of x.) Table 8-2 Table of Values for f xx x sin 1 x fx 0 Error 0.001 0.0008269 0.002 −0.000936 0.003 0.0009565 0.004 −0.003882 0.005 −0.004366 0.006 −0.000969 0.007 −0.006975 0.008 −0.004928 0.009 −0.008234 FIGURE 8-2:  The graph of fx x x sin 1 . CHAPTER 8 Evaluating Limits 155 A better way of seeing that the limit of f is zero as x approaches zero is to use the first calculator method I discuss in the section “Figuring a limit with your calculator.” Enter the function on the home screen and successively plug in the x-values listed in Table 8-3 to obtain the corresponding function values. (Note: Don’t be confused. Table 8-3 is called a “table,” but the values in that table were not generated by a calculator’s table function. Get it?) Now you can definitely see that f is headed toward zero. (You should also look at the values of fx as x approaches zero from the negative side. These values will confirm that g is headed to zero.) 4. Now you should prove the limit mathematically even though you’ve already solved it on your calculator. One way to do this is to make a limit sandwich. For some sandwich method problems, it can be a challenge to come up with the “bread” functions B and T. For such challenging sandwich problems, you’ve got to think about and/or look at the shape of the salami function f, and then use your knowledge of functions and your imagination to come up with some good pros- pects for the bread functions. However, the above sandwich problem is a snap. It’s an example of a common type of sandwich problem of the form fx x n sin or fx x n cos  — basically, x to a positive integer power times the sine or cosine of just about anything. For this class of functions, there are two cases: If n is even, you can use B xx n and T xx n for the bread functions; if n is odd, you can use B xx n and T xx n for the bread functions. Piece o’ cake. Following this rule for the current problem, you can use x for the bottom function and x for the top function. You should graph B xx and T xx along with fx x x sin 1 to confirm that B and T make adequate bread functions for f. Figure 8-3 shows that they do. We’ve shown — though perhaps not to a mathematician’s satisfaction, egad! — that B xf xT x . And because lim lim x x Bx Tx 00 0, it follows that fx must have the same limit: voilà — lim x fx 0 0.

I hope you won’t be too upset with me when I only now show you the easy way to solve this limit problem. (I needed to show you the important ideas in Steps 3 and 4 because you really should learn the theory of the sandwich theorem and also how to squeeze a function between two others. And on top of that, I’ve heard that some teachers and professors may not like the following approach. I’m not sure why because it’s perfectly valid.) All you need to do to solve the current limit problem is to observe 1) that sin 1 x never gets below –1 or above 1 (in other words, it’s bounded by –1 and 1), and 2) that lim x x 0 0. Thus, basically, for limsin x x x0 1 , you’ve got zero times bounded, which equals zero. That’s all there is to it. 19 Evaluate lim x x x0 2 1 sin . 20 Evaluate limcos x x x0 2 1 . FIGURE 8-3:  A graph of B xx , T xx , and fx x x sin 1 . It’s a bow tie! CHAPTER 8 Evaluating Limits 157 Evaluating Limits at ±Infinity In the previous sections, I look at limits as x approaches a finite number, but you can also have limits where x approaches infinity or negative infinity. Consider the function fx x 1 and check out its graph in Figure 8-4. THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD Consider the function fx x x sin, 1 shown in Figures 8-2 and 8-3 and discussed in the sec- tion about making a limit sandwich. It’s defined everywhere except at zero. If you now alter it slightly — by renaming it gx and then defining g 0 to be 0 — you create a new function with bizarre properties. The function is now continuous everywhere; in other words, it has no gaps. But at 0, , 0 it seems to contradict the basic idea of continuity that says you can trace the function without taking your pencil off the paper. Imagine starting anywhere on gx  — which looks exactly like fx in Figures 8-2 and 8-3 — to the left of the y-axis and driving along the winding road toward the origin, 0, 0 . Get this: You can start your drive as close to the origin as you like — how about the width of a proton away from 0, 0  — and the length of road between you and 0, 0 is infinitely long! That’s right. It winds up and down with such increasing frequency as you get closer and closer to 0, 0 that the length of your drive is actually infinite, despite the fact that each “straightaway” is getting shorter and shorter. On this long and winding road, you’ll never get to their door. This altered function is clearly continuous at every point — with the possible exception of 0, 0  — because it’s a smooth, connected, winding road. And because limsin x x x0 1 0 (see the limit sandwich section for proof), and because g 0 is defined to be 0, the three-part test for continuity at 0 is satisfied. The function is thus continuous everywhere. But tell me, how can the curve ever reach 0, 0 or connect to 0, 0 from the left (or the right)? Assuming you can traverse an infinite distance by driving infinitely fast, when you finally drive through the origin, are you on one of the up legs of the road or one of the down legs? Neither seems possible because no matter how close you are to the origin, you have an infinite number of legs and an infinite number of turns ahead of you. There is no last turn before you reach 0, 0 . So, it seems that the function can’t connect to the origin and that, therefore, it can’t be continuous there — despite the fact that the math tells you that it is. Here’s another way of looking at it. Imagine a vertical line drawn on top of the function at x 02. . Now, keeping the line vertical, slowly slide the line to the right over the function until you pass over 0, 0 . There are no gaps in the function, so at every instance, the vertical line crosses the function somewhere. Think about the point where the line intersects with the function. As you drag the line to the right, that point travels along the function, winding up and down along the road, and, as you drag the line over the origin, the point reaches and then passes 0, 0 . Now tell me this: When the point hits 0, 0 , is it on its way up or down? How can you reconcile all this? I wish I knew. Stuff like this really messes with your mind. 158 UNIT 3 Limits You can see on the graph (in the first quadrant) that as x gets bigger and bigger — in other words, as x approaches infinity — the height of the function gets lower and lower but never gets to zero. This is confirmed by considering what happens when you plug bigger and bigger numbers into 1 x : The outputs get smaller and smaller and approach zero. This graph thus has a horizontal asymptote of y 0 (the x-axis), and you say that lim x x 1 0. The fact that x never actually reaches infinity and that f never gets to zero has no relevance. When we say that lim x x 1 0, we mean that as x gets bigger and bigger without end, f is closing in on a height of zero (or f is ultimately getting infinitely close to a height of zero). If you look at the third quadrant, you can see that the function f also approaches zero as x approaches negative infinity, which is written as lim x x 1 0. Like with limits where x approaches a finite number, to solve limit problems where x approaches infinity or negative infinity, you can use your calculator or algebra. But before I go through those techniques, let’s first take care of a special class of limits at infinity where no calculus is needed: rational function limits. Limits of rational functions at ±infinity This section deals with the horizontal asymptotes of rational functions. A rational function is a fraction function with polynomials in the numerator and denominator. (You probably stud- ied rational functions and their asymptotes, both vertical and horizontal, in an algebra and/or a precalculus class.) Determining the limit of a function as x approaches infinity or negative infinity is the same as finding the height of its horizontal asymptote. Say you’ve got a rational function like fx xx xx48 5101 2 3 . First, note the degree of the numer- ator, namely, the highest power of x in the numerator (2 in this function) and the degree of the denominator (3 in this function). There are three cases: » If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, for example, fx xx x 67 28 32 2 , then there’s no horizontal asymptote, and the limit of the function as x approaches infinity (or negative infinity) does not exist (the limit will be positive or negative infinity). FIGURE 8-4:  The graph of fx x 1 . CHAPTER 8 Evaluating Limits 159 » If the degree of the denominator is greater than the degree of the numerator, for exam- ple, gx x x 49 12 2 4 , then the x-axis (that’s the line y 0) is the horizontal asymptote, and limlim x x gx gx 0. » If the degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal, take the coefficient of the high- est power of x in the numerator and divide it by the coefficient of the highest power of x in the denominator. That quotient gives you the answer to the limit problem and the height of the asymptote — for example, if h x xx xx x 4101 52 3 32 , lim lim x x hx hx 4 5 , and h has a horizontal asymptote at y 4 5. Talk like a professor. To impress your friends, point your index finger upward, raise one eye- brow, and say in a professorial tone, “In a rational function where the numerator and denomi- nator are of equal degrees, the limit of the function as x approaches infinity or negative infinity equals the quotient of the coefficients of the leading terms. A horizontal asymptote occurs at this same value.” does not equal 1. Substitution doesn’t work for the problems in this section. If you try plug- ging infinity into x in any of the rational functions in this section, you get but that does not necessarily equal 1 ( sometimes equals 1, but it often does not). A result of tells you noth- ing about the answer to a limit problem. Examples? EXAMPLES?! We don’t need no stinking examples. (My apologies to the late, great director John Huston). See the bullet points earlier in this section and then try the following practice problems. 21 What’s lim x xx xx 510 23 32 4 ? Explain your answer. 22 What’s lim x xx x 3 100 4 81 43 4 ? Explain your answer. 160 UNIT 3 Limits Solving limits at infinity with a calculator In many situations in calculus (and math in general), your calculator can be a great tool. Some- times you can use it to solve problems you can’t solve the pure, algebraic way. It can also give you ideas that you can use to solve a problem the “right” way. And you can use it to check your answers. Your calculator is a good thing to try with some limits at plus or minus infinity. Here’s a limit problem that can’t be done by the method in the previous section because it doesn’t involve a rational function: lim x xx x 2 . But it’s a snap with a calculator. Enter the function in graphing mode, then go to Table Setup and set TblStart to 100,000 and Tbl to 100,000. Table 8-4 shows the results. You can see that y is getting extremely close to 0.5 as x gets larger and larger. So, 0.5 is the limit of the function as x approaches infinity. (The function is not a rational function, but it has a horizontal asymptote at y 05. . All functions, rational or not, that have a finite limit answer as x approaches infinity or negative infinity have a horizontal asymptote at the limit answer height.) If you have any doubts that the limit equals 0.5, go back to Table Setup and put in a humongous TblStart and Tbl, say 1,000,000,000, and check the table results again. All you see is a column of 0.5’s. That’s the limit. By the way, unlike with the rational functions in the previous section, the limit of this function as x approaches negative infinity doesn’t equal the limit as x approaches posi- tive infinity. For this function, here’s what happens when x approaches negative infinity: lim lim . x x xx xx xx 2 1 Now plug in: 1 . One more thing: Just as with regular limits, using a non-CAS (Computer Algebra System) calculator for infinite limits won’t allow you to deduce the exact answer unless the numbers in the table are getting close to a number you recognize, like 0.5. If the exact limit answer is something like 3 5 , on the other hand, you won’t recognize that exact answer from its decimal approximation. Table 8-4 Table of Values for xx x 2 x y 100,000 0.4999988 200,000 0.4999994 300,000 0.4999996 400,000 0.4999997 500,000 0.4999998 600,000 0.4999998 700,000 0.4999998 800,000 0.4999998 900,000 0.4999999 CHAPTER 8 Evaluating Limits 161 does not equal zero. Substitution does not work for the problem, lim x xx x 2 . If you plug into x, you get , which does not necessarily equal zero ( sometimes equals zero, but it often does not). A result of tells you nothing about the answer to a limit problem. You’ll get some practice using your calculator in some of the Your Turn problems in the next section. Solving limits at ±infinity with algebra In general, to find a limit at infinity ( lim x or lim x ) with algebra, you can use the same techniques from the bulleted list in the section, “Solving limit problems with algebra,” earlier in this chapter. And, if you’re dealing with a fraction function that’s not a rational function, a good algebraic technique is to divide the numerator and denominator of the fraction by the highest power of x that appears anywhere in the fraction. Also, for some limits at positive infinity, the following tip may come in handy. Evaluating infinity/infinity. Consider the following four types of expressions: x 10, 5 x, x !, and x x. If a limit at positive infinity involves a fraction with one of them over another, you can apply this handy little tip. These four expressions are listed from “smallest” to “largest.” The limit will equal zero if you have a “smaller” expression over a “larger” one, and the limit will equal infinity if you have a “larger” expression over a “smaller” one. (This isn’t a true ordering; it’s only for problems of this type.) And note the following things: 1. Coefficients don’t change the order — for example, 1000 12 5 300 10xx x,, !, and 0 065. x x. 2. For the first expression (x 10), the power can be any number, while for the second expression (5 x), the number must be greater than one. 3. Replacing x with a multiple of x (like 5 10x or 6 10x ) doesn’t change the order — with one important exception: with the factorial expression, replacing the x with kx (if k 1 like with 4x ! or 18.!x ) makes the expression the largest of the four; if 0 1k , the order doesn’t change. Q. Find lim x x x 3 101. . A. The limit is zero. This is an example of a “smaller” expression over a “larger” one, so the answer is 0. Perhaps this result surprises you. You may think that this fraction will keep getting bigger and bigger because it seems that no matter what power 1.01 is raised to, it will never grow very large. And, in fact, if you plug 1000 into x, the quotient is big — over 47,000. But if you enter x x 3 101. in graphing mode and then set both TblStart and ΔTbl to 1000, the table values show quite convincingly that the limit is 0. By the time x 3000, the answer is about 0.00293, and when x 10 000, , the answer is roughly 6 10 32. 162 UNIT 3 Limits Q. Find lim x x xx 100 5 2 32cos . A. The limit is zero. 1. Divide the numerator and denominator by the highest power of x appearing in the fraction — that’s x 3. lim lim xx x x x x x x x x x 100 5 100 5 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 coscos 2. Now you can plug in. 100 5 0 50 0 cos Here’s the justification for cos 0: Values of the cosine function are always between –1 and 1 inclusive. You say that the cosine function is bounded by –1 and 1, or, symbolically, that 11cos x for all x. For problems like this one, you can use the rule that bounded 0. For other limit problems, a related rule may come in handy: zero bounded = zero. Note: While the rational function rule discussed earlier in this chapter will give you the correct answer for this problem, you should not use the rule here because this function is not a rational function. Q. Find lim x xx x 2 with algebra. You got the answer earlier in this chapter with a calculator, but all things being equal, it’s better to solve the problem algebraically because then you have a mathematically airtight answer. The calculator answer for this limit is very convincing, but it’s not mathematically rigorous, so if you stop there, the math police might get you. A. The limit is 1 2 . 1. Try substitution — always a good idea. No good. You get , which tells you nothing — see the Warning in the previous section. On to plan B. Because xx x 2 contains a square root, the conjugate multiplication method would be a natural choice, except that that method is used for fraction functions. Well, just put xx x 2 over the number 1 and, voilà, you’ve got a fraction: xx x 2 1 . Now do the conjugate multiplication. CHAPTER 8 Evaluating Limits 163 2. Multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of xx x 2 and simplify. lim lim lim x x x xx x xx xx xx xx x x 2 22 2 2 1 1 xxx xx x x 2 2 2(First, cancel the s in the numerator.

(If you’ve got a calculator like a Texas Instruments TI-84, a good way to do this is to use the Sto button to store –3.0001 into x, then enter xx x 2 524 3 into the home screen and hit Enter.) The calculator’s answer is –11.0001. Because this is near the round number –11, your answer is –11. By the way, you can do this problem easily with algebra as well. 2 lim sin tanx x x0 1 1 Enter the function in graphing mode like this: sin x xtan 1 . Then go to Table Setup and enter a small increment into ΔTbl (try 0.01 for this problem), and enter the arrow-number, 0, into tblStart. When you scroll through the table near x 0, you’ll see the y-values getting closer and closer to the round number 1. That’s your answer. This problem, unlike Problem 1, is not easy to do with algebra — until, that is, you learn L’Hôpital’s rule in Chapter 18. 3 lim x x x3 2 9 3 6 Factor, cancel, and plug in. lim lim x x xx x x 3 3 33 3 36 4 lim x x xx1 2 1 2 1 3 Factor, cancel, and plug in. lim lim x x x xx x 1 1 1 12 1 2 1 3 5 lim x x x2 3 2 8 1 12 Factor, cancel, and plug in. lim lim x x x xx x xx 2 2 2 2 2 2 22 4 1 24 1 22 24 1 12 6 lim x x xx2 2 2 4 45 6 0 166 UNIT 3 Limits Did you waste your time factoring the numerator and denominator?

If not, try the following hint before you read the solution: This fraction sort of resembles the one in Problem 12. Still stuck? Okay, here you go: 1. Multiply the numerator and denominator by 3.

Think of it this way. The 8 represents the function y 8, which is a horizontal line at a height of 8. The limit problem asks you to determine what y is getting closer and closer to along the function as x gets closer and closer to 5. But, since the function is a horizontal line, y is always equal to 8 regardless of the value of x. Thus, lim lim lim lim lim x xx xx53 2023 88 88 88. 17 lim x kk 0 (k is a constant) Don’t forget that for all calculus problems, constants behave like ordinary numbers. In Problem 16, the 8 represented the horizontal line y 8, so in this problem, the k represents the horizontal line y k. So, y is always at a height of k regardless of the value of x. Thus, the limit equals k. 18 lim x x x4 3 4 4 0 Plug in the arrow-number: You get 0 0, so keep going and try some basic algebra. lim lim lim / / x x x x x x x x 4 3 4 1 13 4 23 4 4 4 4 4 Now you can plug in: 44 00 23 23/ / 19 lim sin x x x0 2 1 0 There are three ways to do this. The easiest method is to note that lim x x 0 0 and that sin 1 2x never gets greater than 1 or less than –1 (it’s bounded by –1 and 1). Then, because zero bounded zero, the limit is zero. Warning: There’s a chance that your calc teacher may not like this logic. Second, you can use your calculator: Store something small like 0.1 into x and then input x x sin 1 2 into your home screen and hit Enter. You should get a result of ~ .005. Now store 0.01 into x and use the Entry button to get back to x x sin 1 2 and hit Enter again. The result is 170 UNIT 3 Limits ~ .0 003. Now try 0.001, then 0.0001 (giving you ~ .0 00035 and ~ .0 00009), and so on. It’s pretty clear — though probably not to the satisfaction of your professor — that the limit is 0. The third way will definitely satisfy a persnickety professor. You’ve got to sandwich (or squeeze) your salami function, x x sin 1 2 , between two bread functions that have identical limits as x approaches the same arrow-number that it approaches in the salami function, namely the arrow-number of zero. Use the rule explained in the example problem. The current func- tion, x x sin 1 2 , is the same thing as x x 1 2 1 sin . Because the power on the first x is 1, an odd number, you’ve got the second case where you can use x for the bottom function and x for the top function. Graph B xx , fx x x sin 1 2 , and T xx at the same time on your graphing calculator, and you can see that x x sin 1 2 is always greater than or equal to x and always less than or equal to x . Because lim x x 0 0 and lim x x 0 0, and because x x sin 1 2 is sandwiched between them, lim x x x0 2 1 sin must also be zero. 20 lim cos x x x0 2 1 0 For lim x x x0 2 1 cos , the power on x is an even number (namely 2), so you’ve got the first case explained in the text where you can use B xx 2 and T xx 2 for the bread functions. The cosine of anything is always between –1 and 1, so x x 2 1 cos is sandwiched between those two bread functions. (You should confirm this by looking at their graphs. Use the following window on your graphing calculator: radian mode, Xmin = –0.15625, Xmax = 0.15625, Xscl = 0.05, Ymin = –0.0125, Ymax = 0.0125, Yscl = 0.005.) Because lim x x 0 2 0 and lim x x 0 2 0, limcos x x x0 2 1 must also be zero. 21 lim x xx xx 510 23 0 32 4 Because the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, this is a Case I problem. So, the limit as x approaches infinity is zero. 22 lim x xx x 3 100 4 81 3 8 43 4 lim x xx x 3 100 4 81 43 4 is a Case II example because the degrees of the numerator and denomi- nator are both 4. The limit is thus the quotient of the coefficients of the leading terms in the numerator and denominator, namely, 3 8 . 23 lim !x xx x According to the “larger” over “smaller” tip, this answer must be infinity. Or you can get this result with your calculator. If you set the table (don’t forget: fork on the left, spoon on the right) with something like TblStart = 100 and ΔTbl = 100, and then look at the table, you may see “undef” for some or all of the y-values, depending on your calculator model. You have to be careful when trying to interpret what “undef” (for “undefined”) means on your calculator. It often means infinity, but not always, so don’t just jump to that conclusion. Instead, make TblStart and ΔTbl smaller, say, 10. Sure enough, the y-values grow huge very fast, and you can safely conclude that the limit is infinity. CHAPTER 8 Evaluating Limits 171 24 lim x x x 52 41 5 22 1. Divide the numerator and denominator by the highest power of x appearing in the fraction — that’s x or x 1. (The x 2 isn’t a higher power of x because the x 2 gets square rooted. Square rooting something is the same as raising it to the 1 2 power, so, you’ve basi- cally got xx 2 12 1.) lim x x x x x 52 41 2 2. Put the x into the square root (it becomes x 2). lim x x x x x 52 41 2 2 3. Distribute the division in the numerator and denominator. lim x x x 5 2 4 1 2 4. Plug in and simplify. 5 2 4 1 50 40 5 2 2 Here’s a calculator solution. Plug 100 then 1000 then 10,000 then 100,000 into x. The results are 2.51, 2.501, 2.5001, and 2.50001. Since these numbers are getting closer and closer to the round number 2.5, that’s the limit. It’s great when you can do a problem two completely dif- ferent ways and obtain the same result. That should give you a great deal of confidence that your answer is correct. 25 lim x xx x4163 3 8 2 1. Put the entire expression over 1 so you can use the conjugate trick. lim x xx xx xx xx x 4163 1 4163 4163 22 2 2. FOIL the numerator. lim x xx x xx x 16 16 3 4163 22 2 172 UNIT 3 Limits 3. Simplify the numerator and factor out 16 2x inside the radicand. lim x x xx x 3 4161 3 16 2 4. Pull the 16 2x out of the square root; it becomes –4x. You have to pull a positive out of the radicand (as always), so you pull out negative 4x because when x is negative (which it is as it approaches negative infinity), –4x is positive. Got it? lim lim x x x xx x x x x 3 44 1 3 16 3 41 1 3 16 5. Cancel, then plug in. lim x x 3 41 1 3 16 3 41 1 3 16 3 41 10 Piece o’ c . 3 8 ake Here’s a calculator solution: plug –100 then –1000 then –10,000 then –100,000 into x in the limit expression. Here’s what you get: 0.374824, 0.374982, 0.374998, 0.375. Bingo. Do you recognize 0.375? 26 lim x x x x x 3 1 3 1 6 22 1. Subtract the fractions using the LCD of xx x––11 1 2 . lim x xx xx x 31 31 1 22 2 2. Simplify. lim lim x x xx xx x x x 33 33 1 6 1 32 32 2 2 2 3. Your answer is the quotient of the coefficients of x 2 in the numerator and the denominator. See Case 3 in the section, “Limits of rational functions at infinity.” 6 CHAPTER 8 Evaluating Limits 173 Note that had you plugged infinity into the original problem, you would have 3 1 3 1 0 22 ? It may seem strange, but infinity minus infinity does not equal zero. Here’s a calculator confirmation of your algebraic solution. Plug 100 then 1000 then 10,000 into x in the limit expression. That gives you 6.0006, 6.000006, 6.00000006. That’s clearly homing in on 6. 27 lim cos x x 2 does not exist (DNE) The best approach to this limit problem is to simply sketch or picture the graph of the cosine function (or graph it on your graphing calculator). As x moves left toward negative infinity, the cosine curve oscillates between heights of –1 and 1. The curve never approaches a single height; the oscillation goes on forever. This tells you that lim x xcos does not exist (and, by the same reasoning, lim x xcos DNE). The function in this problem, lim x xcos 2 , has a differ- ent shape than cos x, but it oscillates forever in the same way between heights of –1 and 1 (it oscillates faster and faster the further out you go toward infinity or negative infinity). Thus, cos x 2 does not exist (DNE). 28 lim sin x x x 0 Like lim x xcos , lim x xsin DNE because the sine function oscillates forever between heights of –1 and 1 as x gets larger and larger. But it doesn’t follow that the answer to the current prob- lem is also DNE. The function, sin x x , does oscillate forever as x gets larger and larger, but the amplitude of the oscillation gets damped more and more as x gets larger. Near x 100, for example, the amplitude of the oscillation gets divided by about 100, so sin x x oscillates between heights of about –0.01 and 0.01. Near x 1000, sin x x oscillates between about –0.001 and 0.001, and so on. The crests and troughs of the oscillating wave get smaller and smaller and closer and closer to a height of zero. That’s the limit: zero. 29 lim . x x x e1 1 2 718 No work required here. This is one of the handful of limits you should just memorize. Since the number e came up here, I can’t resist mentioning what some say is the most ele- gant equation in mathematics — one short, simple equation that contains the five most important numbers in mathematics: 0, 1, , e, and i (the square root of –1). Here it is: ei 10. 174 UNIT 3 Limits 30 lim x x x e1 1 3 3 For this problem, keep in mind the solution to Problem 29: lim x x x e1 1 . The idea for the current problem is to manipulate the limit with the 3x in it until you get something that resembles the solution from Problem 29. Here’s what you do: First, set the limit in question equal to y; then cube both sides: lim lim x x x x x y x y 1 1 3 1 1 3 3 3 On the left, you can pull the lim symbol to the outside of the parentheses (just take my word for it): lim x x x y1 1 3 3 3 Now, use the power-to-a-power rule: lim x x x y1 1 3 3 3 See how this limit resembles the limit from Problem 29? You’re almost there. The next step is to set u equal to 3x so you can replace each 3x with a u. And, because u x3 , as x approaches infinity, so does u; thus, you can replace the x below the lim symbol with a u: lim u u u y1 1 3 Finally, this limit is mathematically identical to the one from Problem 29, which equals e. Therefore, e y 3 But you need y, not y 3, because you set the limit you want equal to y. So, solve for y, and you’re done: y e 3 , thus lim x x x e1 1 3 3 If you’re ready to test your skills a bit more, take the following chapter quiz that incorporates all the chapter topics.

Multiply the top and bottom by the conjugate of the denominator (always a good thing to try): lim lim l x x x xx xx xx xx x xx 0 2 0 2 22 32 32 32 32 32 iim x xx x x0 2 32 Now, cancel and then plug in: lim x xx x 0 32 0 That’s it. And don’t forget: while 0 0 will sometimes equal zero (like here), it very often does not. 2 lim x x x1 3 6 1 1 1 2 The first thing you see (and read) when you see this fraction is x cubed. That might make you think of factoring the numerator and denominator using the difference of cubes pattern. Your first step would look like this: lim x xx x xx x1 2 24 2 11 11 You could keep going from there, and you’d get the correct answer. However, you can save some effort if you notice that you can factor the denominator using the difference of squares pattern instead (nothing needs to be done to the numerator): lim lim x x x xx x 1 3 33 1 3 1 11 1 1 1 2 3 lim x x x1 6 4 1 1 3 2 CHAPTER 8 Evaluating Limits 177 You can factor the top with the difference of squares pattern or the difference of cubes pat- tern. The difference of squares is the only option for the denominator, so you might think that’d be the way to go for the entire fraction. You can get the correct answer that way, but, here, the quickest solution is to use the difference of cubes pattern on the top and the differ- ence of squares pattern on the bottom, because then you can immediately cancel: lim lim x x xx x xx xx x 1 24 2 22 1 42 2 11 11 1 1 Plug in and you’re done: 3 2 . (I hope it goes without saying that no cancelling can be done in the original fraction until you factor! Ditto for the original fraction in Problem 2.) 4 lim x x x1 3 1 1 3 Here’s a quickie. It’s another difference of cubes problem: lim lim x x xx x x xx 1 2 1 2 2 11 1 1 11 13 5 lim x x x1 3 6 1 1 1 Did you begin by using the difference of cubes pattern on the top and either the difference of cubes or difference of squares pattern on the bottom? Tricked you! All you do is plug in for your answer: 11 11 1. Don’t forget: Always plug in first! 6 lim x 1 This question concerns a limit of the function fx or y . But that function is a hori- zontal line with a constant height of 3 14159. .... The arrow-number is irrelevant. For any arrow-number, the answer is . 7 lim x xx xx0 21 1 2 1 Absolute value bars can make it difficult to do ordinary algebra, so you should always con- sider whether there’s some way to get rid of them. Here’s how you do that in this problem. For the first absolute value expression 21x , when x is near zero (whether x is approaching zero from the left or the right), 2 1x will be close to 1, and, therefore, the absolute value bars are doing nothing and can be removed. For x and 2x , since x is approaching zero from the right, x and 2x will always be positive, and, again, the bars are doing nothing and can be removed. So now you’ve got the following: lim x xx xx0 21 1 2 178 UNIT 3 Limits Simplify and you’re done: lim lim x x x x0 0 11 8 lim x xx xx0 21 1 2 3 The first absolute expression works the same, of course, as in Problem 7, so just get rid of the bars. But in this problem, since x is approaching zero from the left, x and 2x will always be negative, so you can’t just eliminate the bars. Absolute value bars turn a negative into a posi- tive, and you can achieve that by multiplying by –1. Thus, you can get rid of the absolute value bars around the x and the 2x by multiplying by –1 instead. Like so. lim x xx xx0 21 11 12 1 Simplify and you’re done: lim lim lim x x x xx xx x x 0 0 0 21 1 2 3 33 9 lim x xx xx0 21 1 2 undefined The limit from the left does not equal the limit from the right, so this two-sided limit is undefined. 10 lim cos sin x x x 2 2 2 For trig limit problems, always be ready to use your trusty trig identities. Just use the identity for sin 2x , then cancel and plug in. Piece o’ cake: lim cos sincos lim sin x x x xx x 2 2 2 2 1 11 lim seccos sinx xx x 1 1 2 2 2 If you noticed that cos sin cot 2 2 2x x x, and that, therefore, you could rewrite the original problem like lim seccot x xx1 2 , that’s a good thing to notice. Unfortunately, however, that doesn’t help much in this particular problem. You could finish the problem from there, but, actually, the original version is a bit better, because you want to be dealing with a fraction. The key is to multiply the top and bottom by the conjugate of sec x 1, namely, sec x 1. Like so. CHAPTER 8 Evaluating Limits 179 lim secsec cos secsin lim sec x x xx x xx x 11 1 1 2 2 2 cos secsin 2 21 x xx Next, you use the Pythagorean Identity for tangent and secant, tan sec 22 1xx : lim tancos secsinx xx xx 22 21 And then use the fact that tan sin cos 2 2 2x x x : lim sin cos cos secsinx x x x xx 2 2 2 21 Cancel everything, plug in, and you’re done: lim secx x 1 1 1 11 1 2 12 lim sin cosx x x 821 1 1642 2 Multiply the top and bottom by the conjugate of cos x 1: lim sincos coscos lim sin x x xx xx x 821 1 11 821 2 2 cos cos x x 1 1 2 Now you can use the Pythagorean Identity to replace cos2 1x with sin2 x: lim sincos sinx xx x 821 1 2 2 Finally, cancel and plug in for your answer: lim cos cos x x821 1 821 1 821 11 1642 Bonus trivia: What’s the significance of the answer in the history of mathematics? Isaac Newton was born in 1642. He and Gottfried Leibniz were the co-inventors of calculus (or at least, that’s the one-sentence story). For a fuller account, check out the Wikipedia article, “History of calculus.” 180 UNIT 3 Limits 13 lim x kx x xx 32 32 1 1 3 2 2 Don’t forget: Constants behave exactly like ordinary numbers. So, you could ask yourself how the problem would work if the k were, say, a 5 instead of a k. Then you’d have lim x xx xx 15 2 32 1 2 2 . This is a straightforward horizontal asymptote problem. It’s the third case discussed in the text where the polynomial in the numerator is of the same degree as the polynomial in the denominator. The horizontal asymptote in that case is given by the quotient of the coeffi- cients of the highest-power terms in the numerator and denominator. The answer is thus 1 3 or 1 3 . 14 lim coscos x xx 11 2 Just plug in infinity. Both 1 and 1 “equal” zero. (This is not a precise mathematical equal- ity, but don’t sweat it.) That leaves you with cos cos00, or 2. 15 lim sinsin x kk This is a tricky little problem. First, don’t forget, again, that constants behave exactly like ordinary numbers. So, you might ask yourself how the problem would work if the k were, say, a 10. Then you’d have limsin x 10. Since sin10 is just a number, limsin x 10 would be asking for the height of the horizontal line y sin10 as you go out toward infinity. But that height is the same everywhere, so the answer would be sin10. Since constants behave exactly like num- bers, limsin sin x kk. The other tricky thing is that even if you got this far, you might be tempted to say that the limit is undefined because you don’t know what k is. But imagine that I asked you to determine the product kk12 . That product is k k 2 32, and that would be your answer. You wouldn’t say that the product was undefined. It works the same in the current problem. 16 lim x xx 3 Don’t forget: You cannot plug in infinity, which would give you , and conclude that the answer is zero. Infinity minus infinity does not equal zero. First, turn the limit expression into a fraction (a good strategy to keep in mind for limit problems). So, you’ve got lim x xx 3 1 . Now, divide the numerator and denominator by the highest power of x appearing in the fraction, namely x 1. That gives you limlim x x x x x x x x x 3 23 1 1 1 1 . Now you can plug in infinity: 1 1 1 10 0 1 0 . 17 lim !x x x 1492 0 You can solve this with the tip earlier in this chapter (under the section “Solving limits at infinity with algebra”) involving the four types of expressions: x 10, 5 x, x !, and x x (these are ordered from small to big). The current problem has a smaller expression type over a larger one, so the answer is a zero. The large number 1492 has no impact on the result.4 Differentiation In This Unit . . .

Chapter 13 Quiz Answers to Chapter 13 Quiz CHAPTER 9 Differentiation Orientation 183 Differentiation Orientation D ifferential calculus is the mathematics of change and the mathematics of infinitesimals. You might say that it’s the mathematics of infinitesimal changes — changes that occur every gazillionth of a second. Without differential calculus  — if you’ve got only algebra, geometry, and trigonometry  — you’re limited to the mathematics of things that either don’t change or that change or move at an unchanging rate. Remember those problems from algebra? “One train leaves the station at 3 p.m. going west at 80 mph. Two hours later, another train leaves going east at 50 mph . . .” You can handle such a problem with algebra because the speeds or rates are unchanging. Our world, however, isn’t one of unchanging rates — rates are in constant flux. Think about putting an astronaut on the moon. Apollo 11 took off from a moving launch pad (the earth is both rotating on its axis and revolving around the sun). As the rocket flew higher and higher, the friction caused by the atmosphere and the effect of the earth’s gravity were chang- ing not just every second, not just every millionth of a second, but every infinitesimal fraction of a second. The spacecraft’s weight was also constantly changing as it burned fuel. All of these things influenced the rocket’s changing speed. On top of all that, the rocket had to hit a moving target, the moon. All of these things were changing, and their rates of change were changing. Say the rocket was going 1000 mph one second and 1020 mph a second later — during that Chapter 9 IN THIS CHAPTER » Discovering the simple algebra behind calculus » Getting a grip on weird calculus symbols » Differentiating with Laurel and Hardy » Finding the derivatives of lines and curves » Tackling the tangent line problem and the difference quotient 184 UNIT 4 Differentiation one second, the rocket’s speed literally passed through the infinite number of different speeds between 1000 and 1020 mph. How can you do the math for these ephemeral things that change every infinitesimal part of a second? You can’t do it without differential calculus. Differential calculus is used for all sorts of terrestrial things as well. Much of modern economic theory, for example, relies on differentiation. In economics, everything is in constant flux. Prices go up and down, supply and demand fluctuate, and inflation is constantly changing. Because these things are constantly changing, the ways they affect each other are constantly changing. You need calculus for this. Differential calculus is one of the most practical and powerful inventions in the history of mathematics. So let’s get started already. Differentiating: It’s Just Finding the Slope Differentiation is the first of the two major ideas in calculus (the other is integration, which I cover in Unit  5). Differentiation is the process of finding the derivative of a function like y x 2. The derivative is just a fancy calculus term for a simple idea you know from algebra: slope. Slope, as you know, is the fancy algebra term for steepness. And steepness is the fancy word for . . . No! Steepness is the ordinary word you’ve known since you were a kid, as in, “Hey, this road sure is steep.” Everything you study in differential calculus all relates back to the simple idea of steepness. In differential calculus, you study differentiation, which is the process of deriving — that’s finding — derivatives. These are big words for a simple idea: finding the steepness or slope of a line or curve. Throw some of these terms around to impress your friends. By the way, the root of the words differential and differentiation is difference — I explain the connection at the end of this chapter in the section on the difference quotient. Consider Figure 9-1. A steepness of 1 2 means that as the stick man walks one foot to the right, he goes up 1 2 foot; where the steepness is 3, he goes up 3 feet as he walks 1 foot to the right. Where the steepness is zero, he’s at the top, going neither up nor down; and where the steep- ness is negative, he’s going down. A steepness of 2, for example, means he goes down 2 feet for every foot he goes to the right. This is shown more precisely in Figure 9-2. Negative slope: To remember that going down to the right (or up to the left) is a negative slope, picture an uppercase N, as shown in Figure 9-3. Don’t be among the legions of students who mix up the slopes of vertical and horizontal lines. How steep is a flat, horizontal road? Not steep at all, of course. Zero steepness. So, a horizontal line has a slope of zero. (Like where the stick man is at the top of the hill in Figure 9-1.) What’s it like to drive up a vertical road? You can’t do it. And you can’t get the slope of a vertical line — it doesn’t exist, or, as mathematicians say, it’s undefined. CHAPTER 9 Differentiation Orientation 185 FIGURE 9-1:  Differentiating just means finding the steepness or slope. FIGURE 9-2:  The derivative = slope = steepness. FIGURE 9-3:  This N line has a Negative slope. 186 UNIT 4 Differentiation The slope of a line Keep going with the slope idea — by now, you should know that slope is what differentiation is all about. Take a look at the graph of the line, y x23, in Figure 9-4. VARIETY IS THE SPICE OF LIFE Everyone knows that 39 2 . Now, wouldn’t it be weird if the next time you read this math fact, it was written as 239 or 239? How does 39 2 grab you? Or 39 2 ? Variety is not the spice of math- ematics. When mathematicians decide on a way of expressing an idea, they stick to it — except, that is, with calculus. Are you ready? Hold on to your hat. All of the following are different symbols for the derivative — they all mean exactly the same thing: dy dx or df dx or df x dx or Dyx or d dx fx or fx or y or f or y or Dfx or Df or Df xx . There are more. Now, you’ve got two alternatives: 1) Beat your head against the wall trying to figure out things like why some author uses one sym- bol one time and a different symbol another time, and what exactly does the d or f mean anyway, and so on and so on, or 2) Don’t try to figure it out; just treat these different symbols like words in different languages for the same idea — in other words, don’t sweat it. I strongly recommend the second option. FIGURE 9-4:  The graph of y x23. CHAPTER 9 Differentiation Orientation 187 You remember from algebra — I’m totally confident of this — that you can find points on this line by plugging numbers into x and calculating y: plug 1 into x and y equals 5, which gives you the point located at 15, ; plug 4 into x and y equals 11, giving you the point 411, , and so on. I’m sure you also remember how to calculate the slope of this line. I realize that no calculation is necessary here — you go up 2 as you go over 1, so the slope is automatically 2. You can also simply note that y x23 is in slope-intercept form ( )ymxb and that, since m 2, the slope is 2. (See Chapter 5 if you want to review y mx b.) But bear with me because you need to know what follows. First, recall that Slope rise run yy xx 21 21 The rise is the distance you go up (the vertical part of a stair step), and the run is the distance you go across (the horizontal part of a stair step). Now, take any two points on the line, say, 15, and 615, , and figure the rise and the run. You rise up 10 from 15, to 615, because 5 plus 10 is 15 (or you could say that 15 minus 5 is 10). And you run across 5 from 15, to 615, because 1 plus 5 is 6 (or in other words, 6 minus 1 is 5). Next, you divide to get the slope: Slope rise run 10 5 2 Here’s how you do the same problem using the slope formula: Slope yy xx 21 21 Plug in the points 15, and 615, : Slope 15 5 61 10 5 2 Okay, let’s summarize what you know about this line. Table 9-1 shows six points on the line and the unchanging slope of 2. Table 9-1 Points on the Line y = 2x + 3 and the Slope at Those Points 188 UNIT 4 Differentiation The derivative of a line The preceding section showed you the algebra of slope. Now, here’s the calculus. The derivative (the slope) of the line in Figure 9-4 is always 2, so you write dy dx deey deex equals22(.)Read Another common way of writing the same thing is y yprime equals22(.)Read And you say, The derivative of the function, y x23, is 2. (Read The derivative of the function, y x23, is 2. That was a joke.) The Derivative: It’s Just a Rate Here’s another way to understand the idea of a derivative that’s even more fundamental than the concept of slope: A derivative is a rate. So why did I start the chapter with slope? Because slope is in some respects the easier of the two concepts, and slope is the idea you return to again and again in this book and any other calculus textbook as you look at the graphs of dozens and dozens of functions. But before you’ve got a slope, you’ve got a rate. A slope is, in a sense, a picture of a rate; the rate comes first, the picture of it comes second. Just like you can have a function before you see its graph, you can have a rate before you see it as a slope. Calculus on the playground Imagine Laurel and Hardy on a teeter-totter  — check out Figure  9-5. (You don’t remember Laurel and Hardy? Shocking! They were the internationally famous comedy duo from the late 1920s till the mid-1950s. Many movies were made about them; most recently was the 2018 film, Stan & Ollie. Check it out.) FIGURE 9-5:  Laurel and Hardy — blithely unaware of the calculus implications. CHAPTER 9 Differentiation Orientation 189 Assuming Hardy weighs twice as much as Laurel, Hardy has to sit twice as close to the center as Laurel for them to balance. And for every inch that Hardy goes down, Laurel goes up two inches. So Laurel moves twice as much as Hardy. Voilà, you’ve got a derivative! A derivative is a rate. A derivative is simply a measure of how much one thing changes com- pared to another — and that’s a rate. Laurel moves twice as much as Hardy, so with calculus symbols, you write dLdH2 Loosely speaking, dL can be thought of as the change in Laurel’s position and dH as the change in Hardy’s position. You can see that if Hardy goes down 10 inches, then dH is 10, and because dL equals 2 times dH, dL is 20 — so Laurel goes up 20 inches. Dividing both sides of this equa- tion by dH gives you dL dH 2 And that’s the derivative of Laurel with respect to Hardy. (It’s read as, “dee L, dee H,” or as, “the derivative of L with respect to H.”) The fact that dL dH 2 simply means that Laurel is moving 2 times as much as Hardy. Laurel’s rate of movement is 2 inches per inch of Hardy’s movement. Now let’s look at it from Hardy’s point of view. Hardy moves half as much as Laurel, so you can also write dHdL 1 2 Dividing by dL gives you dH dL 1 2 This is the derivative of Hardy with respect to Laurel, and it means that Hardy moves 1 2 inch for every inch that Laurel moves. Thus, Hardy’s rate is 1 2 inch per inch of Laurel’s movement. By the way, you can also get this derivative by taking dL dH 2, which is the same as dL dH 2 1 , and flipping it upside down to get dH dL 1 2 . These rates of 2 inches per inch and 1 2 inch per inch may seem a bit odd because we often think of rates as referring to something per unit of time, like miles per hour. But a rate can be anything per anything. So, whenever you’ve got a this per that, you’ve got a rate; and if you’ve got a rate, you’ve got a derivative. 190 UNIT 4 Differentiation Speed — the most familiar rate Speaking of miles per hour, say you’re driving at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. That’s your car’s rate, and 60 miles per hour is the derivative of your car’s position, p, with respect to time, t. With calculus symbols, you write dp dt 60 miles hour This tells you that your car’s position changes 60 miles for each hour that the time changes. Or you can say that your car’s position (in miles) changes 60 times as much as the time changes (in hours). Again, a derivative just tells you how much one thing changes compared to another. And just like the Laurel and Hardy example, this derivative, like all derivatives, can be flipped upside down: dt dp 1 60 hours mile This hours-per-mile rate is certainly much less familiar than the ordinary miles-per-hour rate, but it’s nevertheless a perfectly legitimate rate. It tells you that for each mile you go, the time changes 1 60 of an hour. And it tells you that the time (in hours) changes 1 60 as much as the car’s position (in miles). There’s no end to the different rates you might see. You just saw miles per hour and hours per mile. Then there’s miles per gallon (for gas mileage), gallons per minute (for water draining out of a pool), output per employee (for a factory’s productivity), and so on. Rates can be constant or changing. In either case, every rate is a derivative, and every derivative is a rate. The rate-slope connection Rates and slopes have a simple connection. All of the previous rate examples can be graphed on an x-y coordinate system, where each rate appears as a slope. Consider the Laurel and Hardy example again. Laurel moves twice as much as Hardy. This can be represented by the following equation: LH2 Figure 9-6 shows the graph of this function. The inches on the H-axis indicate how far Hardy has moved up or down from the teeter-totter’s starting position; the inches on the L-axis show how far Laurel has moved up or down. The line goes up 2 inches for each inch it goes to the right, and its slope is thus 2 1, or 2. This is the visual depiction of dL dH 2, showing that Laurel’s position changes 2 times as much as Hardy’s. CHAPTER 9 Differentiation Orientation 191 One last comment. You know that slope rise run . Well, you can think of dL as the rise and dH as the run. That ties everything together quite nicely. slope rate rise run dL dH A derivative is just a slope, and a derivative is also just a rate. The Derivative of a Curve The sections so far in this chapter have involved linear functions — straight lines with unchang- ing slopes. But if all functions and graphs were lines with unchanging slopes, there’d be no need for calculus. The derivative of the Laurel and Hardy function graphed previously is 2, but you don’t need calculus to determine the slope of a line. Calculus is the mathematics of change, so now is a good time to move on to parabolas: curves with changing slopes. Figure 9-7 is the graph of the parabola, y x 1 4 2. Notice how the parabola gets steeper and steeper as you go to the right. You can see from the graph that at the point 21, , the slope is 1; at 4, 4 , the slope is 2; at 6, 9 , the slope is 3, and so on. Unlike the unchanging slope of a line, the slope of a parabola depends on where you are; it depends on the x-coordinate of wherever you are on the parabola. So, the derivative (or slope) of the function y x 1 4 2 is itself a function of x — namely, 1 2 x (I’ll show you how I got that in a minute). To find the slope of the curve at any point, you just plug the x-coordinate of the point into the derivative, 1 2 x, and you’ve got the slope. For instance, if you want the slope at the point 3, 2.25 , plug 3 into the x, and the slope is 1 2 times 3, or 1.5. Table 9-2 shows some points on the parabola and the steepness at those points. FIGURE 9-6:  The graph of LH2. 192 UNIT 4 Differentiation Here’s the calculus. You write dy dx xy x 1 2 1 2 or And you say, The derivative of the function y x 1 4 2 is 1 2 x. Or you can say, The derivative  of 1 4 2x is 1 2 x. I promised to tell you how to derive this derivative of y x 1 4 2, so here you go: Table 9-2 Points on the Parabola y x 1 4 2 and the Slopes at Those Points FIGURE 9-7:  The graph of y x 1 4 2. CHAPTER 9 Differentiation Orientation 193 1. Beginning with the original function, 1 4 2x , take the power and put it in front of the coefficient. 2. Multiply. 2 times 1 4 is 1 2, so that gives you 1 2 2x . 3. Reduce the power by 1. In this example, the 2 becomes a 1. So, the derivative is 1 2 1x or just 1 2 x. This and many other differentiation techniques are discussed in Chapter 10. The following problems emphasize the fact that a derivative is basically just a rate or a slope. So to solve these problems, all you have to do is answer the questions as if they had asked you to determine a rate or a slope instead of a derivative. Q. What’s the derivative of y x54 ? A. The answer is –4. y x54 is the same as y x45. And you know, of course, that the slope of y x45 is –4, right? No? Egad! Any line of the form y mx b has a slope equal to m. The derivative of a line or curve is the same thing as its slope, so the derivative of this line is –4. Remember: You can think of the derivative dy dx as basically rise run . 1 If you leave your home at time 0, and speed away in your car at 60 miles hour , what’s dp dt , the derivative of your position with respect to time? 2 Using the information from Problem 1, write a function that gives your posi- tion as a function of time. 194 UNIT 4 Differentiation 3 What’s the slope of the parabola y xx 1 3 23 3 85 3 2 at the point 79, ? See the follow- ing figure. 4 What’s the derivative of the parabola y x 2 5 at the point 05, ? Hint: Graph the parabola. 5 With your graphing calculator, graph both the line y x49 and the parabola y x5 2. You’ll see that they’re tangent at the point 21, . (a) What is the derivative of y x5 2 when x 2? (b) On the parabola, how fast is y changing compared to x when x 2? CHAPTER 9 Differentiation Orientation 195 The Difference Quotient Sound the trumpets! You come now to what is perhaps the cornerstone of differential calculus: the difference quotient, the bridge between limits and the derivative. (But you’re going to have to be patient here, because it’s going to take me a few pages to explain the logic behind the dif- ference quotient before I can show you what it is.) Okay, so here goes. I keep repeating — have you noticed? — the important fact that a derivative is just a slope. You learned how to find the slope of a line in algebra. In Figure 9-7, I gave you the slope of the parabola at several points, and then I showed you the short-cut method for finding the derivative  — but I left out the important math in the middle. That math involves limits, and it takes you to the threshold of calculus. Hold on to your hat. Slope is defined as rise run , and slope yy xx 21 21 . To compute a slope, you need two points to plug into this formula. For a line, this is easy. You just pick any two points on the line and plug them in. But it’s not so simple if you want, say, the slope of the parabola fx x 2 at the point 2, 4 . Check out Figure 9-8. You can see the line drawn tangent to the curve at 2, 4 . Because the slope of the tangent line is the same as the slope of the parabola at 2, 4 , all you need is the slope of the tangent line to give you the slope of the parabola. But you don’t know the equation of the tangent line, so you can’t get the second point — in addition to 2, 4  — that you need for the slope formula. Here’s how the inventors of calculus got around this roadblock. Figure 9-9 shows the tangent line again and a secant line intersecting the parabola at 2, 4 and at 10 100, . Definition of secant line: A secant line is a line that intersects a curve at two points. This is a bit oversimplified, but it’ll do. FIGURE 9-8:  The graph of fx x 2 or y x 2 with a tangent line at 2, 4 . 196 UNIT 4 Differentiation The slope of this secant line is given by the slope formula: Slope rise run yy xx 21 21 100 4 10 2 96 8 12 You can see that this secant line is steeper than the tangent line, and thus the slope of the secant, 12, is higher than the slope you’re looking for. Now add one more point at 6, 36 and draw another secant using that point and 2, 4 again. See Figure 9-10. Calculate the slope of this second secant: Slope 36 4 62 32 4 8 FIGURE 9-9:  The graph of fx x 2 with a tangent line and a secant line. FIGURE 9-10:  The graph of fx x 2 with a tangent line and two secant lines. CHAPTER 9 Differentiation Orientation 197 You can see that this secant line is a better approximation of the tangent line than the first secant. Now, imagine what would happen if you grabbed the point at 6, 36 and slid it down the parabola toward 2, 4 , dragging the secant line along with it. Can you see that as the point gets closer and closer to 2, 4 , the secant line gets closer and closer to the tangent line, and that the slope of this secant thus gets closer and closer to the slope of the tangent? So, you can get the slope of the tangent if you take the limit of the slopes of this moving secant. Let’s give the moving point the coordinates xy22, . As this point xy22, slides closer and closer to xy11, , namely 2, 4 , the run, which equals xx21, gets closer and closer to zero. So, here’s the limit you need: Slope sof tangent as point slides toward lim( (, ) 24 llope rise run yy xx of moving secant run xx ) lim lim li 0 21 2121 mm x y x2 2 2 2 4 2 Watch what happens to this limit when you plug in four more points on the parabola that are closer and closer to 2, 4 : When the point xy22, slides to 3, 9 , the slope is 94 32 , or 5. When the point slides to 21 441., . , the slope is 4414 21 2 .. , or 4.1. When the point slides to 2014 0401., . , the slope is 4.01. When the point slides to 2 001 4 004001., . , the slope is 4.001. Sure looks like the slope is headed toward 4. (By the way, the fact that the slope at 2, 4  — which you’ll see in a minute does turn out to be 4 — is the same as the y-coordinate of the point is a meaningless coincidence, as is the pattern you may have noticed in these numbers between the y-coordinates and the slopes.) As with all limit problems, the variable in this problem, x 2, approaches but never actually gets to the arrow-number (2 in this case). If it got to 2 — which would happen if you slid the point you grabbed along the parabola until it was actually on top of 2, 4  — you’d get 44 22 0 0, which is undefined. But, of course, the slope at 2, 4 is precisely the slope you want: the slope of the line when the point does land on top of 2, 4 . Herein lies the beauty of the limit process. With this limit, you get the exact slope of the tangent line at 2, 4 even though the limit function, y x 2 2 4 2, generates slopes of secant lines. Here again is the equation for the slope of the tangent line: Slope y xx lim 2 2 2 2 4 2 198 UNIT 4 Differentiation And the slope of the tangent line is — you guessed it — the derivative. Meaning of the derivative: The derivative of a function fx at some number xc, written as fc , is the slope of the tangent line to f drawn at c. The slope fraction y x 2 2 4 2 is expressed with algebra terminology. Now let’s rewrite it to give it that highfalutin calculus look. But first (finally!), the definition you’ve been waiting for. Definition of the difference quotient: There’s a fancy calculus term for the general slope frac- tion, rise run or yy xx 21 21 , when you write it in the fancy calculus way. A fraction is a quotient, right? And both y y21 and xx21 are differences, right? So, voilà, it’s called the difference quotient. Here it is: fx hf x h (This is the most common way of writing the difference quotient. You may run across other, equivalent ways.) In the following pages, I show you how yy xx 21 21 morphs into the difference quotient. Okay, let’s lay out this morphing process. First, the run, xx21 (in this example, x 2 2), is called — don’t ask me why — h. Next, because x1 2 and the run equals h, x 2 equals 2 h. You then write y1 as f 2 and y 2 as fh2 . Making all the substitutions gives you the derivative of x 2 at x 2: f rise run y x fh f h run x h 2 4 2 22 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 lim lim lim 2 22 0 lim h fh f h lim h fh f h0 22 22 is simply the shrinking rise run stair-step that you can see in Figure 9-10 as the point slides down the parabola toward 2, 4 . Figure 9-11 is basically the same as Figure 9-10 except that, instead of exact points like 6, 36 and 10 100, , the sliding point has the general coordinates of 22hf h, , and the rise and the run are expressed in terms of h. Figure 9-11 is the ultimate figure for f fh f hh 2 22 0 lim . Have I confused you with these two figures? Don’t sweat it. They both show the same thing. Both figures are visual representations of f fh f hh 2 22 0 lim . I just thought it’d be a good idea to show you a figure with exact coordinates before showing you Figure 9-11 with all that strange-looking f and h stuff in it. CHAPTER 9 Differentiation Orientation 199 Doing the math gives you, at last, the slope of the tangent line at 2, 4 : f fh f h h h h h 2 22 22 0 0 22 lim lim (The function iss so right?) fx x fh h hh hh 2 2 0 2 22 44 4 , , lim lim lim lim h h h hh h hh h h 0 2 0 0 4 4 4 40 4 So, the slope at the point 2, 4 is 4. Main definition of the derivative: If you replace the point 22, f   — in Figure  9-11 and the limit math that follows it — with the general point xf x, , you get the general definition of the derivative as a function of x: fx fx hf x hh lim 0 So, at last you see that the derivative is defined as the limit of the difference quotient. FIGURE 9-11:  Graph of fx x 2 showing how a limit produces the slope of the tangent line at 2, 4 . 200 UNIT 4 Differentiation Figure  9-12 shows this general definition graphically. Note that Figure  9-12 is virtually identical to Figure  9-11, except that x’s replace the 2’s in Figure  9-11 and that the moving point in Figure 9-12 slides down toward any old point xf x, instead of toward the specific point 22, f . Now work out this limit and get the derivative for the parabola fx x 2: fx fx hf x h xh x h h h lim lim 0 0 2 2 (The functiion is so, .) fx fx h x xh xxhh h 2 2 0 222 , lim x h xh h h hx h h xh xx h h h 2 0 2 0 0 2 2 2 20 2 lim lim lim Thus, for this parabola, the derivative (which is the slope of the tangent line at each value x) equals 2x. Plug any number into x, and you get the slope of the parabola at that x-value. Try it. To close this section, let’s look at one final figure. Figure 9-13 sort of summarizes (in a simpli- fied way) all the difficult preceding ideas about the difference quotient. Like Figures 9-10, 9-11, and 9-12, Figure 9-13 contains a basic slope stair-step, a secant line, and a tangent line. The slope of the secant line is rise run , or y x . The slope of the tangent line is dy dx . You can think of dy dx FIGURE 9-12:  Graph of fx x 2 showing how a limit produces the slope of the tangent line at the general point xf x, . CHAPTER 9 Differentiation Orientation 201 as alittle ultimately infinitesimalbit of y alittle ultimately in () ( ffinitesimalbit of x) , and you can see why this is one of the symbols used for the derivative. As the secant line stair-step shrinks down to nothing, or, in other words, in the limit as x and y go to zero, dy dx y x (the slope of the tangent line) (the slope of the ssecant line). Average Rate and Instantaneous Rate Returning once again to the connection between slopes and rates, a slope is just the visual depiction of a rate: The slope, rise run , just tells you the rate at which y changes compared to x. If, for example, the y-coordinate tells you distance traveled (in miles), and the x-coordinate tells you elapsed time (in hours), you get the familiar rate of miles per hour. Each secant line in Figures 9-9 and 9-10 has a slope given by the formula yy xx 21 21 . That slope is the average rate over the interval from xx12to . If y is in miles and x is in hours, you get the average speed in miles per hour during the time interval from xx12to . When you take the limit using the difference quotient and get the slope of the tangent line, you get the instantaneous rate at the point xy11, . Again, if y is in miles and x is in hours, you get the instantaneous speed at the single point in time, x1. Because the slope of the tangent line is the derivative, this gives you another definition of the derivative. Another definition of the derivative: The derivative of a function fx at some x-value is the instantaneous rate of change of f with respect to x at that value. FIGURE 9-13:  In the limit, dy dx y x . 202 UNIT 4 Differentiation To Be or Not to Be? Three Cases Where the Derivative Does Not Exist To close this chapter, I want to discuss the three situations where a derivative fails to exist (see the section “33333 Limit Mnemonic,” in Chapter 7). By now, you certainly know that the derivative of a function at a given point is the slope of the tangent line at that point. So, if you can’t draw a tangent line, there’s no derivative — that happens in the first two cases discussed here. In the third case, there’s a tangent line, but its slope and the derivative are undefined. » Case I: There’s no tangent line and thus no derivative at any type of discontinuity: removable, infinite, or jump. (These types of discontinuity are discussed and illustrated in Chapter 7.) Continuity is, therefore, a necessary condition for differentiability. It’s not, however, a suf- ficient condition, as the next two cases show. Dig that logician-speak. » Case II: There’s no tangent line and thus no derivative at a sharp corner on a function (or at a cusp, a really pointy, sharp turn). See function f in Figure 9-14. » Case III: Where a function has a vertical tangent line (which occurs at a vertical inflec- tion point), the slope is undefined, and thus the derivative fails to exist. See function g in Figure 9-14. (Inflection points are explained in Chapter 11.) Q. What’s the slope of the parabola fx x10 2 at x 3? A. The slope is –6. Here’s the definition of the derivative again: fx fx hf x hh lim 0 FIGURE 9-14:  Cases II and III where there’s no derivative. CHAPTER 9 Differentiation Orientation 203 1.

(c) What’s the average velocity from t 4 to t 401. ? 11 For the position function in Problem 10, what’s the instantaneous velocity at t 4? Hint: Use the derivative. CHAPTER 9 Differentiation Orientation 205 (a) –4 The derivative of a curve tells you its slope or steepness. Because the line and the parabola are equally steep at 21, , and because you know the slope of the line is –4, the slope of the parabola at 21, is also –4 and so is its derivative. (b) It’s decreasing 4 times as fast as x increases. A derivative is a rate as well as a slope. Because the derivative of the parabola is –4 at 21, , that tells you that y is changing 4 times as fast as x, but because the 4 is nega- tive, y decreases 4 times as fast as x increases. This is the rate of y compared to x only for the one instant at 21,  — and thus it’s called an instantaneous rate. A split second later — say at x 2 000001.  — y will be decreasing a bit faster. Practice Questions Answers and Explanations 1 dp dt 60 A derivative is always a rate, and a rate is always a derivative. So, if your speed, or rate, is 60 miles hour , the derivative, dp dt , is also 60. 2 The function is p tt60 or p t60 , where t is in hours and p is in miles. If you plug 1 into t, your position is 60 miles; plug 2 into t and your position is 120 miles. The function pt60 is a line, of course, in the form y mx b (where b 0 because you started your trip at your home where your position is zero). So, the slope is 60 and the derivative is thus 60. And, again, you see that a derivative is a slope and a rate. 3 The slope is 3. You can see that the line, y x312, is tangent to the parabola, y xx 1 3 23 3 85 3 2 , at the point 7, 9 . You know from y mx b that the slope of y x312 is 3. At the point 7, 9 , the parabola is exactly as steep as the line, so the derivative (that’s the slope) of the parabola at 7, 9 is also 3. The slope of the parabloa is different at every point. The slope of the line stays constant, but the slope of the parabola changes as you climb up from 7, 9 , getting less and less steep. Even if you go to the right just 0.001 to x 7 001. , the slope will no longer be exactly 3. 4 Zero The point 0, 5 is the very top of the parabola, y x 2 5. At the top, the parabola is going neither up nor down — just like you’re going neither up nor down at the moment when you walk across the crest of a hill. The top of the parabola is flat or level in this sense, and thus the slope and derivative both equal zero. The fact that the derivative is zero at the top of a hill (and at the bottom of a valley) is a critically important point that you’ll return to time and time again. 5 206 UNIT 4 Differentiation 6 y 4 y xh x h xh x h h h h h h lim lim lim 0 0 0 43 43 44 34 3 4 llim h y 04 4 You can also figure this out because the slope of y x43 is 4. 7 f xx6 fx xh x h xxhh x h x h h h lim lim lim 0 2 2 0 22 2 0 2 33 32 3 3 63 3 63 22 0 2 xh hx h xh h h h h lim (.) l Now, factor out the iim (.) lim() h h hx h h h xh 0 0 63 63 Cancel the ((.)Nowplug0 into h x fx x 63 0 6 8 y x2 y xh x h xxhh x h h lim lim 0 2 2 0 22 2 55 25 5 h xxhh x h xh h h h h lim lim( 0 22 2 0 2 25 5 2 Nowfacctor.

That explanation was based on common sense. But now, with the result given by the differ- ence quotient, namely y x2 , you have a rigorous confirmation of the derivative’s value at 0, 5 . Just plug 0 in for x in y x2 , and you get y 0. CHAPTER 9 Differentiation Orientation 207 (a) gx x 2 45 If you got this one, give yourself a pat on the back.

Notice how the average velocities in Problem 10 get closer and closer to 24 miles hour as the total travel time gets less and less and the ending time homes in on t 4. That’s precisely how the difference quotient works as h shrinks to zero. If you’re ready to test your skills a bit more, take the following chapter quiz that incorporates all the chapter topics. CHAPTER 9 Differentiation Orientation 209 Whaddya Know? Chapter 9 Quiz Quiz time! Complete each problem to test your knowledge on the various topics covered in this chapter. You can then find the solutions and explanations in the next section. 1 For Problems 1 and 2, refer to the following figure. The figure shows a graph of fx x 3 and a line tangent to f at 11, that crosses f at 2, 8 . (a) What’s the derivative of f at x 0? (b) What’s the derivative of f at x 1? 2 What’s the derivative of f at x 1 and why? 210 UNIT 4 Differentiation 3 For this problem, refer to the following figure. The figure shows a graph of fx x 3 and a line tangent to f at 11, that crosses f at 82, . (a) What’s the derivative of f at x 1? (b) What’s the derivative of f at x 1? (c) What’s the derivative of f at x 0? 4 What’s the derivative of gx 1 at 11, ? For Problems 5 through 8, use the definition of the derivative, fx fx hf x hh lim 0 , to determine the derivative of the given function. 5 fx 8. (You should know the derivative here without using this definition, but you should use the definition for practice.) 6 gx x. (You should be able to get this derivative in your head without using the difference quotient, but, again, it’s a good idea to practice using the difference quotient to learn how to apply it to all sorts of functions.) 7 fx x 3 8 gx x10 CHAPTER 9 Differentiation Orientation 211 (a) The derivative is zero. A derivative is a slope, so to determine the derivative of fx x 3 at x 0, you need merely to notice that f is horizontal for one infinitesimal point as it crosses the origin. The slope of a horizontal line is zero, so the derivative of fx x 3 at x 0 is zero. (b) The derivative at x 1 equals 3. A derivative tells you the slope or steepness of a curve at a given point, and that’s the same thing as the slope of a tangent line drawn at that point. So, all you need is the slope of the line tangent to f at 11, . That line crosses f at 2, 8 . The slope formula gives you its slope: slope yy xx 21 21 18 12 9 3 3. 2 The derivative at x 1 (like the derivative at x 1) equals 3. The key to this problem is to note that f is an odd function (see Chapter 5 for a discussion of even and odd functions). Odd functions are symmetrical about the origin. One thing this means is that if you take an odd function like f and rotate it 180 about the origin, it lands on itself. You can see this by turning the figure for Question 2 upside down. You see the very same shape except that the tangent line now touches the curve at 1, 1 and crosses the curve at 2, 8 . That tangent line (on the upside-down graph) has the same slope as the orig- inal tangent line. By the way, a feature of all odd functions is that if you know the derivative of the function at any x-value, the derivative at the opposite x-value will be the same. (And a feature of all even functions is that if you know the derivative of the function at any x-value, the derivative at the opposite x-value will be the opposite of the original derivative.) 3 Answers to Chapter 9 Quiz 1 (a) The derivative at x 1 is 1 3 . The line tangent to f at 11, crosses f at 82, . The slope formula gives you a slope of 1 3 . (b) The derivative at x 1 (like the derivative at x 1) is 1 3 . This problem works just like Problem 2. Refer back to that solution. The function fx x 3 , like fx x 3, is an odd function, and thus the derivative of x 3 at x 1 is the same as it is at x 1. (c) The derivative at x 0 is undefined. As fx x 3 crosses the origin, it’s vertical for one infinitesimal point. In other words, a tangent line drawn to f at the origin would be vertical. The slope of a vertical line is undefined, and thus the derivative of f at x 0 is undefined. 212 UNIT 4 Differentiation 4 The derivative is zero. The function gx 1 is a horizontal line, so its slope is zero. And, thus, the derivative of g at 11, (or at any other point on g) equals zero. End of story. 5 The derivative is zero. Of course, like with Problem 4, this function, fx 8, is a horizontal line, so its slope and derivative equal zero. Here’s how you do it with the limit of the difference quotient: fx fx hf x hh lim 0 . For fx 8, f of anything equals –8, so fx h 8. Plug in and finish: fx hhhh h lim lim lim 00 0 88 00 0 . 6 The derivative equals –1. The function gx x is a line (in y mx b form, g would be written as y x10). So, its slope and derivative equal –1. Now let’s get the derivative with the limit of the difference quotient. To compute gx gx hg x hh lim 0 , you need gx h ; that equals xh . Now you can plug in and finish: gx xh x hh h h xh x hh hh lim lim lim lim 00 00 1 1. 7 The derivative equals 3 2x . You need fx h , so you can plug that into fx fx hf x hh lim 0 . The function is fx x 3, so fx h equals xh 3. Expanding that gives you xx hxhh 32 2333 . Plug in and finish: fx xx hxhh x h xx hxh h h lim lim 0 32 23 3 0 32 2 33 33 hhx h xh xh h h hx xh h h h h h 33 0 22 3 0 22 0 33 33 lim lim lim 333 3 22 2 xxhh x CHAPTER 9 Differentiation Orientation 213 8 The derivative equals 1 2 x . You are given that gx x10 , so gx hx h10 . Plugging those expressions into the definition of the derivative gives you gx h xh x h lim 0 10 10 . Now cancel the 10’s, then reverse the order of the two radicals in the numerator to make the numerator more ordinary-looking. Then multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the numerator, and finish: gx h h h xh x xx h xx hx xh xx h h h h lim lim lim 0 0 0 lim lim lim h h h xx h xx h h xx h xx h h h 0 0 0 1 1 2 x CHAPTER 10 Differentiation Rules — Yeah, Man, It Rules 215 Differentiation Rules — Yeah, Man, It Rules C hapter 9 gives you the basic idea of what a derivative is — it’s just a rate like speed and it’s simply the slope of a function. It’s important that you have a solid, intuitive grasp of these fundamental ideas. You also now know the mathematical foundation of the derivative and its technical definition involving the limit of the difference quotient. Now, I’m going to be forever banned from the Royal Order of Pythagoras for saying this, but, to be perfectly candid, you can basically forget that limit stuff — except that you need to know it for your final — because in this chapter I give you shortcut techniques for finding derivatives that avoid the difficulties of limits and the difference quotient. Some of this material is unavoidably dry. If you have trouble staying awake while slogging through these rules, look back to the last chapter and take a peek at the next three chapters to see why you should care about mastering these differentiation rules. Countless problems in business, economics, medicine, engineering, and physics, as well as other disciplines, deal with how fast a function is rising or falling, and that’s what a derivative tells you. And it’s often important to know where a function is rising or falling the fastest (the largest and smallest slopes) and where its peaks and valleys are (where the slope is zero). Before you can do these interesting problems, you’ve got to learn how to find derivatives. If Chapters 11, 12, and 13 are like playing the piano, then this chapter is like learning your scales — it’s dull, but you’ve got to do it. You may want to order up a latte with an extra shot. Chapter 10 IN THIS CHAPTER » Learning the rules whether you like it or not — sorry, buddy, but those are the rules » Mastering the basic differentiation rules and graduating to expert rules » Figuring out implicit differentiation » Using logarithms in differentiation » Differentiating inverse functions 216 UNIT 4 Differentiation Basic Differentiation Rules Calculus can be difficult, but you’d never know it judging by this section alone. Learning these first half dozen or so rules is a snap. If you get tired of this easy stuff, however, I promise plenty of challenges in the next section. The constant rule This is simple: fx 5 is a horizontal line with a slope of zero, and thus its derivative is also zero. So, for any number c, if fx c, then fx 0. Or you can write d dx c 0. End of story. The power rule Say fx x 5. To find its derivative, take the power, 5, bring it in front of the x, and then reduce the power by 1 (in this example, the power becomes a 4). That gives you fx x5 4. To repeat, bring the power in front, then reduce the power by 1. That’s all there is to it. In Chapter 9, I differentiated y x 2 with the difference quotient: yx y xh x h xxhh x h xh h h h h h 2 0 2 2 0 22 2 0 2 2 2 lim lim lim llim h xh x 0 2 2 That takes some doing. Instead of all that, just use the power rule: Bring the 2 in front, and reduce the power by 1; this leaves you with a power of 1 that you can drop (because a power of 1 does nothing). Thus, yx y x 2 2 Because this is so simple, you may be wondering why I didn’t skip the complicated difference quotient stuff and just go straight to the shortcut method. Well, admittedly, that would have saved some time, especially considering the fact that once you know this and other shortcut methods, you’ll never need the difference quotient again — except for your final exam. But the difference quotient is included in every calculus book and course because it gives you a fuller, richer understanding of calculus and its foundations — think of it as a mathematical character builder. Or because math teachers are sadists. You be the judge. CHAPTER 10 Differentiation Rules — Yeah, Man, It Rules 217 The power rule works for any power — a positive, a negative, or a fraction: If then Ifthen If fx xf xx gx xg xx xh 23 23 13 2 2 3 // xxhthen 1 The derivative of x is 1. Make sure you remember how to do the derivative of the last function in this list. It’s the simplest of these functions, yet the easiest one to miss. The best way to understand this derivative is to realize that h xx is a line that fits the form y mx b, because h xx is the same as h xx10 (or y x10). The slope (m) of this line is 1, so the derivative equals 1. Or you can just memorize that the derivative of x is 1. But if you forget both of these ideas, you can always use the power rule. Rewrite h xx as h xx 1, then apply the rule: Bring the 1 in front and reduce the power by 1 to zero, giving you h xx1 0. Because x 0 equals 1, you’ve got h x 1. Rewrite functions so you can use the power rule. You can differentiate radical functions by rewriting them as power functions and then using the power rule. For example, if fx x 23 , rewrite it as fx x 23/ and use the power rule. You can also use the power rule to differentiate functions like fx x 1 3 . Rewrite this as fx x 3, then use the power rule. The constant multiple rule What if the function you’re differentiating begins with a coefficient? Makes no difference. A coefficient has no effect on the process of differentiation. You just ignore it and differentiate according to the appropriate rule. The coefficient stays where it is until the final step, when you simplify your answer by multiplying by the coefficient. Here’s how it works. Differentiate y x4 3. Solution: You know by the power rule that the derivative of x 3 is 3 2x , so the derivative of 4 3x is 4 3 2x . The 4 just sits there doing nothing. Then, as a final step, you simplify: 4 3 2x equals 12 2x . So y x12 2. (By the way, most people just bring the 3 to the front, like this: y x34 2, which gives you the same result.) Differentiate y x5 . Solution: This is a line of the form y mx b with m 5, so the slope is 5, and thus the deriva- tive is 5: y 5. (It’s important to think graphically like this from time to time.) But you can also solve the problem with the power rule: d dx xx 1011; so d dx x55 15 1 . One final example: Differentiate y x5 4 13/ . Solution: The coefficient here is 5 4 . So, because d dx xx 13 231 3 // (by the power rule), d dx xx x 5 4 5 4 1 3 5 12 13 23 23// / . 218 UNIT 4 Differentiation Pi, e, c, k, and so on, are not variables! Don’t forget that (which equals, of course, about 3.14) and e (which equals about 2.72) are numbers, not variables, so they behave like ordinary num- bers. Constants in problems, like c and k, also behave like ordinary numbers. (By the way, the number e, named for the great mathematician Leonhard Euler, is perhaps the most important number in all of mathematics, but I don’t get into that here.) Thus, if y x, y  — this works exactly like differentiating y x5 . And because 3 is just a number, if y 3 then y 0 — this works exactly like differentiating y 10. You’ll also see problems containing constants like c and k. Be sure to treat them like regular numbers. For example, the derivative of y xk52 3 (where k is a constant) is 5, not 56 2k . The sum rule — hey, that’s some rule you got there When you want the derivative of a sum of terms, take the derivative of each term separately. What’s fx if fx xx xx 63 2 10? Solution: Just use the power rule for each of the first four terms and the constant rule for the final term. Thus, fx xx x63 21 52 . The difference rule — it makes no difference If you’ve got a difference (that’s subtraction) instead of a sum, it makes no difference. You still differentiate each term separately. Thus, if y xx xx x32 65 54 32 , then y xx xx15 46 12 5 43 2 . The addition and subtraction signs are unaffected by the differentiation. Q. What’s the derivative of 5 3x ? A. 15 2x 1. Bring the power in front, multiplying it by the coefficient. This first step gives you 15 3x . (Note that this does not equal the original function or its derivative, so you should not put an equal sign in front of it. In fact, there’s no reason to write this interim step down at all. I do it simply to make the process clear.) 2. Reduce the power by one. This gives you the final answer of 15 2x . CHAPTER 10 Differentiation Rules — Yeah, Man, It Rules 219 1 What’s the derivative of fx 8? 2 What’s the derivative of gx 3? 3 What’s the derivative of gx k sincos 2 2 , where k is a constant? 4 For fx x5 4, fx ? 5 For gx x 3 10 , what’s gx ? 6 Find y if y xx 5 0 ( ). 7 What’s the derivative of st tt710 6 ? 8 Find the derivative for y x 3 2 6 . 220 UNIT 4 Differentiation Differentiating trig functions Ladies and gentlemen, I have the high honor and distinct privilege of introducing you to the derivatives of the six trig functions: d dx xx d dx xx d dx xx d dx xx d dx sincos cossin tansec cotcsc sec 22 xxx x d dx xx xsectan csccsc cot Make sure you memorize the derivatives of sine and cosine. They’re a snap, and I’ve never known anyone to forget them. If you’re good at rote memorization, memorize the other four as well. Or, if you’re not wild about memorization or are afraid that this knowledge will crowd out the date of the Battle of Hastings (1066) — which is much more likely to come up in a board game than trig derivatives — you can figure out the last four derivatives from scratch by using the quotient rule (see the section, “The quotient rule,” later in this chapter). A third option is to use the following mnemonic trick. Psst, what’s the derivative of cosecant? Imagine you’re taking a test and can’t remember those four last trig derivatives. You lean over to the guy next to you and whisper, “Psst, what’s the derivative of csc x?” Now, the last three letters of psst (sst) are the initial letters of sec, sec, tan. Write these three down, and below them, write their cofunctions: csc, csc, cot. Put a negative sign on the csc in the middle. Finally, add arrows like in the following diagram: sec sectan csc csccot (This may seem complicated, but take my word for it, you’ll remember the word psst, and after that, the diagram is very easy to remember.) Look at the top row. The sec on the left has an arrow pointing to sec tan — so the derivative of sec x is sec tanxx . The tan on the right has an arrow pointing to sec sec, so the derivative of tan x is sec 2 x . The bottom row works the same way, except that both derivatives are negative. Differentiating exponential and logarithmic functions Caution: Memorization ahead. Exponential functions If you can’t memorize the next rule, hang up your calculator. d dx ee xx That’s right — break out the smelling salts — the derivative of e x is itself! This is a special function: e x and its multiples, like 5e x , are the only functions that are their own derivatives. Think about what this means. Look at the graph of y e x in Figure 10-1. CHAPTER 10 Differentiation Rules — Yeah, Man, It Rules 221 Pick any point on this function, say 2, ~7.4 , and the height of the function at that point, 74. , is the same as the slope at that point. If the base is a number other than e, you have to tweak the derivative by multiplying it by the natural log of the base: If then If then yy yy xx xx 22 2 10 10 10 ln ln Logarithmic functions And now — what you’ve all been waiting for — the derivatives of logarithmic functions. (See Chapter 4 if you want to brush up on logs.) Here’s the derivative of the natural log — that’s the log with base e: d dx x x ln 1 If the log base is a number other than e, you tweak this derivative  — like with exponential functions — except that you divide by the natural log of the base instead of multiplying. Thus, d dx x x x log ln ln ,2 1 2 1 2 and d dx x x xxlog ln loglog 110 10(Recall that means, so the base is 10.) Good news: You get to practice finding derivatives of trig, exponential, and log functions in the next section. FIGURE 10-1:  The graph of y e x . 222 UNIT 4 Differentiation Differentiation Rules for Experts — Oh, Yeah, I’m a Calculus Wonk Now that you’ve totally mastered all the basic rules, take a breather and rest on your laurels for a minute. . . . Okay, ready for a challenge? The following rules, especially the chain rule, can be tough. But you know what they say: “No pain, no gain,” “No guts, no glory,” yada, yada, yada. The product rule You use this rule for — hold on to your hat — the product of two functions like y xx 3 sin The product rule: If then ythisthat ythisthat this that , So, for y xx 3 sin , y xx xx xx xx 33 233 sinsin sincos The quotient rule I have a feeling that you can guess what this rule is for — the quotient of two functions like y x x sin 4 The quotient rule: If then y top bottom y topbottomtop bottom bottom , 2 Many calculus books give the quotient rule in a slightly different form that’s harder to remem- ber. And some books give a “mnemonic” involving the words lodeehi and hideelo or hodeehi and hideeho, which is very easy to get mixed up — great, thanks a lot. Here’s a good way to remember the quotient rule. When you read a product, you read from left to right, and when you read a quotient, you read from top to bottom. So just remember that the quotient rule, like the product rule, works in the natural order in which you read. Both rules begin with the derivative of the first function you read. Also note that the numerator of the quotient rule works just like the product rule, except for the minus sign (which no one forgets). Another CHAPTER 10 Differentiation Rules — Yeah, Man, It Rules 223 thing you won’t forget is the denominator of the quotient rule — take my word for it. Focus on these points and you’ll remember the quotient rule ten years from now — oh, sure. So, here’s the derivative of y x x sin 4 : y xx xx x xx xx x xx x sinsin cossin cossi 44 4 2 43 8 3 4 4 nn cossin x x xx x x 8 5 4 In the section “Differentiating trig functions,” I promised to show you how to find the deriva- tives of four trig functions — tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant — with the quotient rule. I’m a man of my word, so here goes. All four of these functions can be written in terms of sine and cosine, right? (See Chapter 6.) For instance, tan sin cos x x x . Now, if you want the derivative of tan x , you can use the quotient rule: tan sin cos tan sincos sincos cos cosc x x x x xx xx x x 2 oos sinsin cos cossin cos cos xx x x xx x x 2 22 2 2 1 (The Pytthagorean Identity tells you that cossin .) sec 22 2 1xx x Granted, this is quite a bit of work compared to just memorizing the answer or using the mne- monic device presented several pages back, but it’s nice to know that you can get the answer this way as a last resort. The other three functions are no harder. Give them a try. Q. d dx xx 2 sin? A. d dx xx xx xx x xx x 22 2 22 sinsin cos sin sin 224 UNIT 4 Differentiation Q. d dx x x 2 sin ? A. d dx x xx xx x xx x xx 2 22 2 22 sin sinsin sin sincos sinn 2 x (I purposely designed this example to resemble the product rule example, so you can see the similarity between the quotient rule numerator and the product rule.) 9 d dx xx 3 cos? 10 d dx xxsintan ? 11 d dx xx5 3 ln ? 12 d dx xe x x2 ln ? CHAPTER 10 Differentiation Rules — Yeah, Man, It Rules 225 13 d dx x x 3 cos ? 14 d dx e x x cos ? 15 d dx x x x sin ln ? 3 Linking up with the chain rule The chain rule is by far the trickiest derivative rule, but it’s not really that bad if you carefully focus on a few important points. Let’s begin by differentiating y x45 3 . You use the chain rule here because you’ve got a composite function, that’s one function 45 3x inside another function (the square root function). How to spot a composite function: y x is not a composite function because the argument of the square root function — that’s the thing you take the square root of — is simply x. Whenever the argument of a function is anything other than a plain old x, you’ve got a composite function. Be careful to distinguish a composite function from something like y xxsin , which is the product of two functions, x and sin x , each of which does have just a plain old x as its argument. 226 UNIT 4 Differentiation Okay, so you’ve got this composite function, y x45 3 . Here’s how to differentiate it with the chain rule: 1. You start with the outside function, , and differentiate that, IGNORING what’s inside. To make sure you ignore the inside, temporarily replace the inside function with the word stuff. So, you’ve got y stuff . Okay, now differentiate y stuff the same way you’d differentiate y x . Because y x is the same as y x 12/ , the power rule gives you y x 1 2 12/ . So, for this problem, you begin with 1 2 12stuff / . 2. Multiply the result from Step 1 by the derivative of the inside function, stuff . y stuffstuff 1 2 12/ Take a good look at this. All chain rule problems follow this basic idea. You do the derivative rule for the outside function, ignoring the inside stuff, then multiply that by the derivative of the stuff. 3. Differentiate the inside stuff. The inside stuff in this problem is 4 5 3x and its derivative is 12 2x by the power rule. 4. Now put the real stuff and its derivative back where they belong. y xx 1 2 45 12 3 12 2/ 5. Simplify. y xx64 5 23 12/ Or, if you’ve got something against negative powers, y x x 6 45 2 3 12/ . Or, if you’ve got something against fraction powers, y x x 6 45 2 3 . Try differentiating another composite function, y xsin 2 : 1. The outside function is the sine function, so you start there, taking the derivative of sine and ignoring the inside stuff, x 2. The derivative of sin x is cos x, so for this problem, you begin with cos stuff 2. Multiply the derivative of the outside function by the derivative of the stuff. y stuffstuffcos 3. The stuff in this problem is x 2, so stuff is 2x. When you plug these terms back in, you get y xx xx cos cos 2 2 2 2 CHAPTER 10 Differentiation Rules — Yeah, Man, It Rules 227 Sometimes figuring out which function is inside which can be a bit tricky — especially when a function is inside another and then both of them are inside a third function (you can have four or more nested functions, but three is probably the most you’ll see). Here’s a tip. Parentheses are your friend. For chain rule problems, rewrite a composite function with a set of parentheses around each inside function, and rewrite trig functions like sin2 x with the power outside a set of parentheses: sin x 2 . Let’s try a problem — this is a tough one, gird your loins: differentiate y xxsin 3254 . First, rewrite the cubed sine function: y xxsin5 4 2 3 . Now it’s easy to see the order in which the functions are nested. The innermost function is inside the innermost parentheses — that’s 54 2xx. Next, the sine function is inside the next set of parentheses — that’s sin stuff . Last, the cubing function is on the outside of everything — that’s stuff 3. (Because I’m a math teacher, I’m honor-bound to point out that the stuff in stuff 3 is different from the stuff in sin stuff . It’s quite unmathematical of me to use the same term to refer to different things, but don’t sweat it. I’m just using the term stuff to refer to whatever is inside any function.) Okay, now that you know the order of the functions, you can differentiate from outside in: 1. The outermost function is stuff 3 and its derivative is given by the power rule. 3 2stuff 2. As with all chain rule problems, you multiply that by stuff . 3 2stuffstuff 3. Now put the stuff, sin5 4 2xx , back where it belongs. 35 45 4 2 2 2sinsinxx xx 4. Use the chain rule again. You can’t finish this problem quickly by just taking a simple derivative because you have to differentiate another composite function, sin 54 2xx . Just treat sin 54 2xx as if it were the original problem and take its derivative. The derivative of sin x is cos x, so the derivative of sin stuff begins with cos stuff . Multiply that by stuff . Thus, the derivative of sin stuff is cos stuffstuff 5. The stuff for this step is 5 4 2xx and its derivative is 104x . Plug those things back in. cos 54 10 4 2xx x 6. Now that you’ve got the derivative of sin5 4 2xx , plug this result into the result from Step 3, giving you the whole enchilada. 35 45 4104 2 2 2sincosxx xx x 7. This can be simplified a bit. 30 12 54 54 22 2xx xx xsincos 228 UNIT 4 Differentiation I told you it was a tough one. It may have occurred to you that you can save some time by not switching to the word stuff and then switching back. That’s true, but some people like to use the technique because it forces them to leave the stuff alone during each step of a problem. That’s the critical point. Make sure you . . . DON’T TOUCH THE STUFF. As long as you remember this, you don’t need to actually use the word stuff when doing a chain rule problem. You’ve just got to be sure you don’t change the inside function while differen- tiating the outside function. Say you want to differentiate fx xln 3 . The argument of this natural logarithm function is x 3. Don’t touch it during the first step of the solution, which is to use the natural log rule: d dx x x ln 1 . This rule tells you to put the argument of the function in the denominator under the number 1. So, after the first step in differentiating ln x 3 , you’ve got 1 3x . You then finish the problem by multiplying that by the derivative of x 3, which is 3 2x . Final answer: 3 x . With the chain rule, don’t use two derivative rules at the same time. Another way to make sure you’ve got the chain rule straight is to remember that you never use more than one derivative rule at a time. In the preceding example, ln x 3 , you first use the natural log rule, then, as a separate step, you use the power rule to differentiate x 3. At no point in any chain rule problem do you use both rules at the same time. For example, with ln x 3 , you do not use the natural log rule and the power rule at the same time to come up with 1 3 2x . Here’s the chain rule mumbo jumbo. The chain rule (for differentiating a composite function): If then yf gx yf gx gx , Or, equivalently, If and then Notice how the yf uu gx dy dx dy du du dx du , (’ss cancel.) See the sidebar, “Why the chain rule works,” for a plain-English explanation of this mumbo jumbo. One final example and one last tip. Differentiate 4 23xxsin . This problem has a new twist — it involves the chain rule and the product rule. How should you begin? Where do I begin? If you’re not sure where to begin differentiating a complex expression, imagine plugging a number into x and then evaluating the expression on your calculator one step at a time. Your last computation tells you the first thing to do. CHAPTER 10 Differentiation Rules — Yeah, Man, It Rules 229 Say you plug the number 5 into the x’s in 4 23xxsin . You evaluate 4 52 — that’s 100; then, after getting 5 125 3 , you do sin 125 , which is about –0.616. Finally, you multiply 100 by –0.616. Because your last computation is multiplication, your first step in differentiating is to use the product rule. (Had your last computation been instead something like sin 125 , then you’d begin with the chain rule.) Okay, so for this problem, you begin with the product rule. The product rule: Ifthenythisthat ythisthat this that,. So, for fx xx4 23sin , fx xx xx44 23 23sinsin You finish the problem by taking the derivative of 4 2x with the power rule and the derivative of sin x 3 with the chain rule: fx xx xx x84 3 32 32sincos And now simplify: fx xx xx812 34 3sincos WHY THE CHAIN RULE WORKS You wouldn’t know it from the difficult math in this section or the fancy chain rule mumbo jumbo, but the chain rule is based on a very simple idea. Say one person is walking, another jogging, and a third is riding a bike. If the biker goes four times as fast as the jogger, and the jogger goes twice as fast as the walker, then the biker goes 4 times 2, or 8 times as fast as the walker, right? That’s the chain rule in a nutshell — you just multiply the relative rates. Flip back to Chapter 9 and take a look at Figure 9-5 showing Laurel and Hardy on a teeter-totter. For every inch Hardy goes down, Laurel goes up 2 inches. So, Laurel’s rate of movement is twice Hardy’s rate, and therefore dL dH 2. Now imagine that Laurel has one of those party favors in his mouth (the kind that unrolls as you blow into it) and that for every inch he goes up, he blows the noisemaker out 3 inches. The rate of movement of the noisemaker (N) is thus 3 times Laurel’s rate of movement. In calculus symbols, dN dL 3. So, how fast is the noisemaker moving compared to Hardy? This is just common sense. The noisemaker is moving 3 times as fast as Laurel, and Laurel is moving 2 times as fast as Hardy, so the noisemaker is moving 3 times 2, or 6 times as fast as Hardy. Here it is in symbols (note that this is the same as the formal definition of the chain rule next to the Mumbo Jumbo icon): dN dH dN dL dL dH 32 6 Mere child’s play. 230 UNIT 4 Differentiation 16 fx x fx cos ? 4 17 gx x gx sin 3 ? 18 st st ttan ? ln 19 ye y x4 3 ? 20 fx xx fx 43sin ? 21 gx x gx xln ? 2 54 22 yx y cos324 ? 23 d dx e xtan 3 2 ? CHAPTER 10 Differentiation Rules — Yeah, Man, It Rules 231 Differentiating Implicitly All the differentiation problems presented in previous sections of this chapter are functions like y xx 2 5 or y xsin . In such cases, y is written explicitly as a function of x. This means that the equation is solved for y; in other words, y is by itself on one side of the equation. (Note that y was sometimes written as fx as in fx xx 324 , but remember that that’s the same thing as y xx 324 .) Sometimes, however, you are asked to differentiate an equation that’s not solved for y, like y xx y 523 sincos . This equation defines y implicitly as a function of x, and you can’t write it as an explicit function because it can’t be solved for y. For such a problem, you need implicit differentiation. (If you can solve for y, implicit differentiation will still work, but it’s not neces- sary.) When differentiating implicitly, all the derivative rules work the same, with one excep- tion: When you differentiate a term with a y in it, you use the chain rule with a little twist. 24 p p xcos ? 25 p dp dq q 1 ln ? 26 fx x ln 1 . What’s fx at the point 55,ln ? 27 yx x y cos ? 1 232 UNIT 4 Differentiation Remember using the chain rule to differentiate something like sin x 3 with the stuff technique? The derivative of sine is cosine, so the derivative of sin stuff is cos stuffstuff . You finish the problem by finding the derivative of the stuff, x 3, which is 3 2x , and then making the substitu- tions to give you cos xx 323 . With implicit differentiation, a y works like the word stuff. Thus, because sincos , sincos stuffstuff stuff yy y The twist is that while the word stuff is temporarily taking the place of some known function of x (x 3 in this example), y is some unknown function of x (you don’t know what the y equals in terms of x). And because you don’t know what y equals, the y and the y  — unlike the stuff and the stuff — must remain in the final answer. But the concept is exactly the same, and you treat y just like the stuff. You just can’t make the switch back to x’s at the end of the problem like you can with a regular chain rule problem. I suppose you’re wondering whether I’m ever going to get around to actually doing the prob- lem. Here goes: Q. Differentiate y xx y 523 sincos . A. y xx yy cos sin 6 5 4 1. Differentiate each term on both sides of the equation. For the first and fourth terms, you use the power rule and the cosine rule respec- tively, and, because these terms contain y’s, you also use the chain rule. For the second term, you use the regular power rule. And for the third term, you use the regular sine rule. 56 4yy xx yy xy y cossin cossin 2. Collect all terms containing a y on the left side of the equation and all other terms on the right side. 56 4yy yy xxsincos 3. Factor out y . y yx xy56 4 sincos 4. Divide for the final answer. y xx yy cos sin 6 5 4 CHAPTER 10 Differentiation Rules — Yeah, Man, It Rules 233 Note that this derivative, unlike the others you’ve done so far, is expressed in terms of x and y instead of just x. So, if you want to evaluate the derivative to get the slope at a particular point, you need to have values for both x and y to plug into the derivative. Also note that in many textbooks, the symbol dy dx is used instead of y in every step of solutions like the one shown here. I find y easier and less cumbersome to work with. But dy dx does have the advantage of reminding you that you’re finding the derivative of y with respect to x. Either way is fine. Take your pick. 28 If y xx y 32 , find dy dx by implicit differentiation. 29 If 34yy e xln , find y . 30 For xy yx yx 23 5 , find dy dx by implicit differentiation. 31 If y yxcos23 25sin , find the slope of the curve at 10 0, . 234 UNIT 4 Differentiation 32 If 8 5 2yx ytan, find dy dx . 33 Find the slope of the line tangent to the circle xy 22 5 at the point 21, . 34 If 35 43 3yx xy , find dy dx . 35 Find the slope of the normal line to the ellipse 319 22xy at the point 14, . Differentiating Inverse Functions There’s a difficult-looking formula involving the derivatives of inverse functions, but before we get to it, look at Figure 10-2, which nicely sums up the whole idea. Figure  10-2 shows a pair of inverse functions, f and g. Recall that inverse functions are symmetric with respect to the line, y x. As with any pair of inverse functions, if the point 10 4, is on one function, 410, is on its inverse. And, because of the symmetry of the graphs, you can see that the slopes at those points are reciprocals: At 10 4, the slope is 1 3 , and at 410, the slope is 3 1 . That’s how the idea works graphically, and if you’re with me so far, you’ve got it down at least visually. CHAPTER 10 Differentiation Rules — Yeah, Man, It Rules 235 The algebraic explanation is a bit trickier, however. The point 10 4, on f can be written as 10 10, f and the slope at this point — and thus the derivative — can be expressed as f 10 . The point 410, on g can be written as 44, g . Then, because f 10 4, you can replace the 4’s in 44, g with fs10 giving you fg f10 10, . The slope and derivative at this point can be expressed as gf 10 . These two slopes are reciprocals, so that gives you the equation f fg 10 1 10 This difficult equation expresses nothing more and nothing less than the two triangles on the two functions in Figure 10-2. Using x instead of 10 gives you the general formula: The derivative of an inverse function: If f and g are inverse functions, then fx gf x 1 In words, this formula says that the derivative of a function, f, with respect to x, is the reciprocal of the derivative of its inverse function with respect to f. Okay, so maybe it was a lot trickier. FIGURE 10-2:  The graphs of inverse functions, fx and gx . 236 UNIT 4 Differentiation While I’m on the topic of differentiating inverse functions, let me give you the derivatives of the inverse trig functions. Here they are: Derivatives of inverse trig functions. d dx x x x d dx x xx x d dx arcsin , arcsec ,, arcta 1 1 1 1 1 01 2 2 nn x x 1 1 2 d dx x x x d dx x xx x d dx arccos, arccsc, , arc 1 1 1 1 1 01 2 2 ccot x x 1 1 2 Memory aid for the derivatives of the inverse trig functions. To remember the derivatives of the inverse trig functions, notice that the derivative of each co-function (arccosine, arccose- cant, and arccotangent) is the negative of its corresponding function. So, you really only need to memorize the derivatives of arcsine, arcsecant, and arctangent. These three have a 1 in the numerator. The two that contain the letter “S,” arcsin and arcsec, contain a Square root in the denominator and also a Subtraction sign. Arctan has no “S,” so no square root and no subtrac- tion sign (it has an addition sign instead). Q. Use the rule for the derivative of an inverse function to compute arcsin 1 2 , then con- firm your answer using the derivative rule for arcsine. A. 2 3 23 3 or For inverse functions f and g, fx gf x 1 , so arcsin sinarcsin sin cos 1 2 1 1 2 1 6 1 6 1 3 2 2 3 23 3 or Use the derivative rule for arcsine to confirm this answer. arcsin 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 3 4 4 3 2 32 It checks. CHAPTER 10 Differentiation Rules — Yeah, Man, It Rules 237 36 Use the formula for the derivative of an inverse function to compute the derivative of the arctangent function at x 1, then confirm your answer using the rule for the deriva- tive of arctangent. 37 Given that f and g are inverse functions, that f 25, and that the line tangent to f at 25, has a slope of 4, find the equation of the line tangent to g at x 5. Scaling the Heights of Higher-Order Derivatives Finding a second, third, fourth, or higher derivative is incredibly simple. The second derivative of a function is just the derivative of its first derivative. The third derivative is the derivative of the second derivative, the fourth derivative is the derivative of the third, and so on. For exam- ple, here’s a function and its first, second, third, and subsequent derivatives. In this problem, all the derivatives are obtained by the power rule: fx xx x fx xx fx x fx x 42 3 2 5123 41012 12 10 24 ffx fx fx () () () . . 4 5 6 24 0 0 0 0 etc etc 238 UNIT 4 Differentiation All polynomial functions like this one eventually go to zero when you differentiate repeatedly. Rational functions like fx x x 2 5 8 , on the other hand, get messier and messier as you take higher and higher derivatives. And, as shown in the following problem, the higher derivatives of sine and cosine are cyclical. yx yx yx yx y x sin cos sin cos sin ()4 The cycle repeats indefinitely with every multiple of four. In Chapters 11 and 12, I show you several uses of higher derivatives — mainly second deriva- tives. (Here’s a sneak preview: The first derivative of position is velocity, and the second deriv- ative of position is acceleration.) But for now, let me give you just one of the main ideas in a nutshell. A first derivative, as you know, tells you how fast a function is changing — how fast it’s going up or down — that’s its slope. A second derivative tells you how fast the first deriva- tive is changing — or, in other words, how fast the slope is changing. A third derivative tells you how fast the second derivative is changing, which tells you how fast the rate of change of the slope is changing. If you’re getting a bit lost here, don’t worry about it — I’m getting lost myself. It gets increasingly difficult to get a handle on what higher derivatives tell you as you go past the second derivative, because you start getting into a rate of change of a rate of change of a rate of change, and so on. 38 For y x 5, what’s the 1000th derivative? 39 For y xx 33 , find the first through fifth derivatives. CHAPTER 10 Differentiation Rules — Yeah, Man, It Rules 239 40 For y xxsincos , find the first through sixth derivatives. 41 For y xcos 2 , find the first, second, and third derivatives. 42 For y x8 8 3ln , find the sixth derivative. 43 For y xtan , find the fourth derivative. 240 UNIT 4 Differentiation Practice Questions Answers and Explanations 1 f x 0 The derivative of any constant is zero. 2 gx 0 Because is just a number, 3 is also just a number. Therefore, gx 3 is a horizontal line with a slope and a derivative of zero. 3 gx 0 If you feel bored because the first few problems were so easy, just enjoy it; it won’t last. 4 f xx20 3 Bring the 4 in front and multiply it by the 5; at the same time reduce the power by 1, from 4 to 3. 5 gx x x3 10 3 10 2 2 or You can just write down the derivative without showing any work (bring the 3 in front of the x, reduce the power 3 to a 2, and the 10 sits there doing nothing): gx x3 10 2 . But if you want to do it more methodically, it works like this: 1. Rewrite x 3 10 so you can see an ordinary coefficient: 1 10 3x . 2. Bring the 3 in front, multiply, and reduce the power by 1. gx x 3 10 2. This is the same, of course, as 3 10 2x . 6 y x 5 2 72/ Rewrite with an exponent xx 55 2/ and finish like Problem 5: Bring the power in front and reduce the power by one: 5 2 72x / . To write your answer without a negative power, you write y x 5 2 72/ or y x5 2 72/ . Or you can write your answer without a fraction power, to wit: y x 5 2 7 or 5 2 7x or 5 2 7 x or 5 2 7 x . You say “po-tay-to,” I say “po-tah-to.” 7 s tt42 1 5 Note that the derivative of plain old t or plain old x (or any other variable) is simply 1.

First, you can ignore it temporarily, do the differentiating, then multiply your answer by 5. (If you do it this way, don’t forget that the “5” multiplies the entire derivative, not just the first term.) The second way is probably easier and better: Just make the “5” part of the first function.

So your final answer is 3 2sincosxx, or 3 2sincosxx. 18 s tt t secln 2 1 The derivative of tan x is sec 2 x , so the derivative of tan lump is sec 2 lump lump . You better know by now that the derivative of lnt is 1 t , so your final result is sec ln 2 1 t t . 19 y xe x12 24 3 The derivative of e x is e x, so by the chain rule, the derivative of e glob is e glob glob .

Thus, the slope of the curve at this point is zero.

For problems 1 through 15, find dy dx . 254 UNIT 4 Differentiation Answers to Chapter 10 Quiz 1 dy dx xcot This is a chain rule problem, because the input of the function is something other than a plain old x. You begin with the ln rule (so the derivative of ln stuff begins with 1 stuff ), then you finish (as with all chain rule problems) by multiplying that by the derivative of the stuff. The stuff here is sin x , and its derivative is cos x. So, that gives you 1 sin cos x x, which simpli- fies to cot x . (Note that this function, y xln sin , is defined only for angles in the first and second quadrants. Its derivative has the same restrictions. For the rest of the problems, I will skip mentioning any restrictions to the domain of the function or its derivative.) 2 dy dx 0 sin 4 2 2 and ln 2 2 is just a number.

One of the trig Pythagorean Identities is 1 22tansecxx . You can use this to simplify the given function: y xx xxtansec tantan 22 2211. This, of course, is a horizontal line, so its derivative is zero.

Begin by rewriting the given function so that the trig power is on the outside (always a good idea): y xtantan 2. You tackle this nested chain rule problem from outside to inside. So, you first use the power rule (for the power of 2), then you use the tangent rule (the derivative of tan stuff begins with sec 2 stuff ). Then, as always, you finish by multiplying by the derivative of the stuff. yx dy dx xx x tantan tantan tantan tantan s 2 12 2eec tansec 22xx 8 dy dx xx x x sincos sin sin 2 2 32 1 This is a quotient rule problem where you need to use the chain rule when doing the deriva- tive of the numerator. y x x dy dx xx xx x sin sin sinsin sinsin sin 3 33 1 11 1 2 23 2 31 1 sincos sinsin cos sin xx xx x x That’s the calculus. The rest of the solution is just simplification. One way to write your final answer is given above in bold. 9 dy dx x 21 Don’t be thrown by the pi symbol.

That derivative is 525 25 14xx (or ). 10 dy dx ye e xe e ye e ye e xy yx xy xx or You need to use implicit differentiation for this one.

This is a good thing, because in this chapter you use derivatives to understand the shape of functions — where they rise and where they fall, where they max out and bottom out, how they curve, and so on. Then in Chapter 12, you use your knowledge about the shape of functions to solve real-world problems. Taking a Calculus Road Trip Consider the graph of fx in Figure 11-1. Imagine that you’re driving along this function from left to right. Along your drive, there are several points of interest between a and l. All of them, except for the start and finish points, relate to the steepness of the road — in other words, its slope or derivative. Chapter 11 IN THIS CHAPTER » Weathering the ups and downs of moody functions » Locating extrema » Using the first and second derivative tests » Interpreting concavity and points of inflection » Comparing the graphs of functions and derivatives » Muzzling the Mean Value Theorem — GRRRRR 260 UNIT 4 Differentiation Now, prepare yourself — I’m going to throw lots of new terms and definitions at you all at once here. You shouldn’t, however, have much trouble with these ideas because they mostly involve commonsense notions like driving up or down an incline, or going over the crest of a hill. Climb every mountain, ford every stream: Positive and negative slopes First, notice that as you begin your trip at a, you’re climbing up. Thus, the function is increasing and its slope and derivative are therefore positive. You climb the hill till you reach the top at b where the road levels out. The road is level there, so the slope and derivative equal zero. Because the derivative is zero at b, point b is called a stationary point of the function. Point b is also a local maximum or relative maximum of f because it’s the top of a hill. To be a local max, b just has to be the highest point in its immediate neighborhood. It doesn’t matter that the nearby hill at g is even higher. After reaching the crest of the hill at b, you start going down — duh. So, after b, the slope and derivative are negative and the function is decreasing. To the left of every local max, the slope is positive; to the right of a max, the slope is negative. I can’t think of a travel metaphor for this section: Concavity and inflection points The next point of interest is c. Can you see that as you go down from b to c, the road gets steeper and steeper, but that after c, although you’re still going down, the road is gradually starting to curve up again and get less steep? The little down arrow between b and c in Figure 11-1 indicates that this section of the road is curving down — the function is said to be concave down there. As you can see, the road is also concave down between a and b. Concavity poetry: Down looks like a frown, up looks like a cup. A portion of a function that’s concave down looks like a frown. Where it’s concave up, like between c and e, it looks like a cup. FIGURE 11-1:  The graph of fx with several points of interest. CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 261 Wherever a function is concave down, its derivative (and slope) are decreasing; wherever a func- tion is concave up, its derivative (and slope) are increasing. Okay, so the road is concave down until c where it switches to concave up. Because the concavity switches at c, it’s a point of inflection. The point c is also the steepest point on this stretch of the road. Inflection points are always at the steepest — or least steep — points in their immediate neighborhoods. Be careful with function sections that have a negative slope. Point c is the steepest point in its neighborhood because it has a bigger negative slope than any other nearby point. But remem- ber, a big negative number is actually a small number, so the slope and derivative at c are actu- ally the smallest of all the points in the neighborhood. From b to c, the derivative of the function is decreasing (because it’s becoming a bigger negative). From c to d, the derivative is increasing (because it’s becoming a smaller negative). Got it? This vale of tears: A local minimum Let’s get back to your drive. After point c, you keep going down till you reach d, the bottom of a valley. Point d is another stationary point because the road is level there and the derivative is zero. Point d is also a local or relative minimum because it’s the lowest point in its immediate neighborhood. A scenic overlook: The absolute maximum After d, you travel up, passing e, which is another inflection point. It’s the steepest point between d and g and the point where the derivative is greatest. You stop at the scenic overlook at g, another stationary point and another local max. Point g is also the absolute maximum on the interval from a to l because it’s the very highest point on the road from a to l. Car trouble: Teetering on the corner Going down from g, you pass another inflection point, h, another local min, i, then you go up to j, where you foolishly try to drive over the peak. Your front wheels make it over, but your car’s chassis gets stuck on the precipice, leaving you teetering up and down with your wheels spin- ning. Your car teeters at j because you can’t draw a tangent line there. No tangent line means no slope, and no slope means no derivative — or you can say that the derivative at j is undefined. A sharp turning point like j is called a corner. (By the way, be careful with the expressions “no slope” and “no derivative.” In this context, “no” means nonexistent, NOT zero.) It’s all downhill from here After dislodging your car, you head down, with the road getting less and less steep until it flat- tens out for an instant at k. (Again, note that because the slope and the derivative are becoming smaller and smaller negative numbers on the way to k, they are actually increasing.) Point k is another stationary point because its derivative is zero. It’s also another inflection point because the concavity switches from up to down at k. After passing k, you go down to l, your final desti- nation. Because l is the endpoint of the interval, it’s not a local min — endpoints never qualify 262 UNIT 4 Differentiation as local mins or maxes — but it is the absolute minimum on the interval because it’s the very lowest point from a to l. Hope you enjoyed your trip. Your travel diary I want to review your trip and some of the previous terms and definitions, and introduce yet a few more terms: » The function f in Figure 11-1 has a derivative of zero at stationary points (level points) b, d, g, i, and k. At j, the derivative is undefined. These points where the derivative is either zero or undefined are the critical points of the function. The x-values of these critical points are called the critical numbers of the function. (Note that critical numbers must be within a func- tion’s domain.) » All local maxes and mins — the peaks and valleys — must occur at critical points. However, not all critical points are necessarily local maxes or mins. Point k, for instance, is a critical point, but neither a max nor a min. Local maximums and minimums — or maxima and minima — are called, collectively, local extrema of the function. (Use a lot of these fancy plurals if you want to sound like a professor.) A single local max or min is a local extremum. The absolute max is the highest point on the road from a to l. The absolute min is the lowest point. » The function is increasing whenever you’re going up, where the derivative is positive; it’s decreasing whenever you’re going down, where the derivative is negative. The function is also decreasing at point k, a horizontal inflection point, even though the slope and derivative are zero there. I realize that seems a bit odd, but that’s the way it works — take my word for it. At all horizontal inflection points, a function is either increasing or decreasing. At local extrema b, d, g, i, and j, the function is neither increasing nor decreasing. » The function is concave up wherever it looks like a cup or a smile (some say where it “holds water”) and concave down wherever it looks like a frown (or “spills water”). Inflection points c, e, h, and k are where the concavity switches from up to down or vice versa. Inflection points are also the steepest or least steep points in their immediate neighborhoods. Finding Local Extrema — My Ma, She’s Like, Totally Extreme Now that you have the preceding section under your belt and know what local extrema are, you need to know how to do the math to find them. You saw in the last section that all local extrema occur at critical points of a function — that’s where the derivative is zero or undefined (but don’t forget that critical points aren’t always local extrema). So, the first step in finding a function’s local extrema is to find its critical numbers (the x-values of the critical points). CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 263 Cranking out the critical numbers Find the critical numbers of fx xx320 53. See Figure 11-2. Here’s what you do: 1. Find the first derivative of f using the power rule. fx xx fx xx 320 15 60 53 42 2. Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x. 15 60 0 15 40 15 22 0 42 22 2 xx xx xx x 15 02 02 0 02 2 2xx x xx x or or or or These three x-values are critical numbers of f. Additional critical numbers could exist if the first derivative were undefined at some x-values, but because the derivative, 15 60 42xx , is defined for all input values, the above solution set, 0 22,, , and is the complete list of critical numbers. Because the derivative of f equals zero at these three critical numbers, the curve has horizontal tangents at these numbers. In Figure 11-2, you can see the little horizontal tangent lines drawn where x 2 and x 2. The third horizontal tangent line where x 0 is the x-axis. FIGURE 11-2: The graph of fx xx320 53. 264 UNIT 4 Differentiation A curve has a horizontal tangent line wherever its derivative is zero, namely, at its station- ary points. A curve will have horizontal tangent lines at all of its local mins and maxes (except where the derivative is undefined like, for example, at sharp corners like point j in Figure 11-1) and at all of its horizontal inflection points. Now that you’ve got the list of critical numbers, you need to determine whether peaks or valleys or inflection points occur at those x-values. You can do this with either the first derivative test or the second derivative test. I suppose you may be wondering why you have to test the criti- cal numbers when you can see where the peaks and valleys are by just looking at the graph in Figure 11-2 — which you can, of course, reproduce on your graphing calculator. Good point. Okay, so this problem  — not to mention countless other problems you’ve done in math courses — is somewhat contrived and impractical. So what else is new? The first derivative test The first derivative test is based on the Nobel-Prize-caliber ideas that as you go over the top of a hill, first you go up and then you go down, and that when you drive into and out of a valley, you go down and then up. This calculus stuff is pretty amazing, isn’t it? Here’s how you use the test. Take a number line and put down the critical numbers you found above: 0 22,, and . See Figure 11-3. This number line is now divided into four regions: to the left of 2, from 2 to 0, from 0 to 2, and to the right of 2. Pick a value from each region, plug it into the first derivative, and note whether your result is positive or negative. Let’s use the numbers –3, –1, 1, and 3 to test the regions: fx xx f f 15 60 3153 60 31581609 675 1 42 42 15 1601 15 60 45 15 1601 15 60 451 42 42f f 33153 60 31581609 675 42 By the way, if you had noticed that this first derivative is an even function, you’d have known, without doing the computation, that ff11 and that ff33 . (Chapter  5 discusses even functions. A polynomial function with all even powers, like fx shown here, is one type of even function.) FIGURE 11-3: The critical numbers of fx xx320 53. CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 265 These four results are, respectively, positive, negative, negative, and positive. Now, take your number line, mark each region with the appropriate positive or negative sign, and indicate where the function is increasing (where the derivative is positive) and decreasing (where the derivative is negative). The result is a so-called sign graph. See Figure 11-4. (The four right- pointing arrows at the top of the figure simply indicate that “increasing” and “decreasing” tell you what’s happening as you move along the function from left to right.) Figure 11-4 simply tells you what you already know if you’ve looked at the graph of f — that the function goes up until 2, down from 2 to 0, further down from 0 to 2, and up again from 2 on. Now here’s the rocket science. The function switches from increasing to decreasing at 2; in other words, you go up to 2 and then down. So, at 2 you have the top of a hill or a local maxi- mum. Conversely, because the function switches from decreasing to increasing at 2, you have the bottom of a valley there or a local minimum. And because the sign of the first derivative doesn’t switch (from positive to negative or vice versa) at zero, there’s neither a min nor a max at that x-value (you usually — like here — get a horizontal inflection point when this happens). The last step is to obtain the function values, in other words the heights, of the two local extrema by plugging the x-values into the original function: fx xx f f 320 23 2202 64 23 2202 64 53 53 53 Thus, the local max is located at ( ,)264 and the local min is at ( ,)264 . You’re done. To use the first derivative test to check for a local extremum at a particular critical number, the function must be continuous at that x-value. FIGURE 11-4: The sign graph for fx xx320 53. 266 UNIT 4 Differentiation Q. Use the first derivative test to determine the location of the local extrema of gx xx15 35. Refer to the following figure. A. The local min is at 3 162, , and the local max is at 3 162, . 1. Find the first derivative of g using the power rule. gx xx gx xx 15 45 5 35 24 2.

CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 267 3. Plot the three critical numbers on a number line, noting that they create four regions (see the figure in Step 5). 4. Plug a number from each of the four regions into the derivative, noting whether the results are positive or negative. If you’ve already factored the derivative (see Step 2), it’s usually best to use the fac- tored form of the derivative in this step. And all you need to do is note whether the results are positive or negative. There’s no need to compute the exact results. To wit: gx xx x g Pos Pos NegNeg gPo 53 3 4 1 2 .. .. ss Pos Pos Pos g Pos Pos Pos Pos gP ... . ... .1 4 oos Neg Pos Neg.. .. (A slight shortcut here is to notice that since gx is an even function, g 1 must equal g 1 , and g 4 must equal g 4 ). 5. Draw a “sign graph.” Take your number line and label each region — based on your results from Step 4 — positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing). Refer to the following figure. This sign graph tells you where the function is increasing (rising as you go from left to right) and where it is decreasing (falling as you go from left to right). 6. Use the sign graph to determine whether there’s a local minimum, local maximum, or neither at each critical number. Because g goes down on its way to x 3 and up after x 3, it must bottom out at x 3, so there’s a local min there. Conversely, g peaks at x 3 because it rises until x 3, and then falls. There is thus a local max at x 3. And because g climbs on its way to x 0 and then climbs further, there is neither a min nor a max at x 0. 7. Determine the y-values of the local extrema by plugging the x-values into the origi- nal function. g g 3153 3 162 3153 3 162 35 35 So, the local min is at –, –3 162 , and the local max is at 3 162, . 268 UNIT 4 Differentiation 1 Use the first derivative to find the local extrema of fx xx64 1 23/ . 2 Find the local extrema of h x x x 2 2 2 cos in the interval 02, with the first derivative test. 3 Locate the local extrema of y x 2 23 8 / with the first derivative test. 4 Using the first derivative test, deter- mine the local extrema of s t t 4 2 4 2 . The second derivative test — no, no, anything but another test! The second derivative test is based on two more prize-winning ideas: first, that at the crest of a hill, a road has a hump shape — in other words, it’s curving down or concave down; and second, that at the bottom of a valley, a road is cup-shaped, so it’s curving up or concave up. CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 269 The concavity of a function at a point is given by its second derivative: a positive second deriva- tive means the function is concave up, a negative second derivative means the function is con- cave down, and a second derivative of zero is inconclusive (the function could be concave up, concave down, or there could be an inflection point there). When the second derivative test fails. If the second derivative equals zero (or is undefined) at a particular critical number, the second derivative test fails and you learn nothing about whether there’s a local extremum there. When this happens, you have to use the first derivative test to determine whether or not you have a local extremum. Let’s return to the function fx x320 53 that I analyzed in the previous section with the first derivative test. To use the second derivative test for f, all you have to do is find its second derivative and then plug in its critical numbers, which you found before (–2, 0, and 2), and note whether your results are positive, negative, or zero. To wit — fx xx fx xx xxf 320 15 60 60 120 53 42 3 (power rule) xx f f (power rule) 2602 120 2 240 0600 3 3 120 00 2602 120 2 240 3f At x 2, the second derivative is negative (–240). This tells you that f is concave down where x equals –2, and therefore that there’s a local max there. The second derivative is positive (240) where x is 2, so f is concave up and thus there’s a local min at x 2. Because the second deriva- tive equals zero at x 0, the second derivative test fails for that critical number — it tells you nothing about the concavity at x 0 or whether there’s a local min or max there. When this happens, you have to use the first derivative test. After you find a function’s critical numbers, you have to decide whether to use the first or the second derivative test to find the extrema. For some functions, the second derivative test is the easier of the two because 1) the second derivative is usually easy to get, 2) you can often plug the critical numbers into the second derivative and do a quick computation, and 3) you will often get non-zero results and thus get your answers without having to do a sign graph and test regions. (Points 1, 2, and 3 all apply to what you just saw with f 2 and f 2 .) On the other hand, testing regions on a sign graph (the first derivative test) is also fairly quick and easy, and if the second derivative test fails (see the warning), you’ll have to do that anyway. (You just saw this with f 0 .) As you do practice problems, you’ll get a feel for when to use each test. Now go through the first and second derivative tests one more time with the following example. 270 UNIT 4 Differentiation Q. Find the local extrema of gx xx23 4 23/ . See the following figure. A. There’s a local min at 1, 3 , and a local max at 0, 4 . 1. Find the first derivative of g. gx xx gx x 23 4 22 23 13 / / (power rule) 2. Set the derivative equal to zero and solve. 2 20 22 1 1 1 13 13 13 13 3 3 x x x x x / / / / Thus 1 is a critical number. 3. Determine whether the first derivative is undefined for any x-values. The derivative, 2 2 13x / , which equals 2 2 3 x , is undefined at x 0. Thus, zero is another critical number. From Steps 2 and 3, you’ve got the complete list of critical numbers of g: 0 and 1. 4. Plot the critical numbers on a number line, and then use the first derivative test to figure out the sign of each region. You can use –1, 0.5, and 2 as test numbers: gx x g g g 22 14 05 052 20 41 13/ .. . (pos.) (neg.) (pos.) CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 271 The following figure shows the sign graph. Because the first derivative of g switches from positive to negative at zero, there’s a local max there. And because the first derivative switches from negative to positive at 1, there’s a local min at x 1. 5. Plug the critical numbers into g to obtain the function values (the heights) of these two local extrema. gx xx g g 23 4 04 13 23/ So, there’s a local max at 04, and a local min at 1, 3 . You’re done. You could have used the second derivative test instead of the first derivative test in Step 4. First, you need the second derivative of g, which is, as you know, the derivative of its first derivative: gx x gx x 22 2 3 13 43 / / Evaluate the second derivative at x 1 (the critical number from Step 2): g 1 2 3 Because g 1 is positive, you know that g is concave up at x 1 and, therefore, that there’s a local min there. At the other critical number, x 0 (from Step 3), the first derivative is undefined. The second derivative test is no help where the first derivative is undefined, so you’ve got to use the first derivative test for that critical number. 272 UNIT 4 Differentiation 5 Use the second derivative test to analyze the critical numbers of the function from Problem 2, h x x x 2 2 2 cos . 6 Find the local extrema of fx xx26 1 32 with the second derivative test. 7 Find the local extrema of y xx2 1 3 46 with the second derivative test. 8 Consider the function from Problem 3, y x 2 23 8 / , and the function s tt 8 21 4 7 4 3 . Which of the two functions is easier to analyze with the second derivative test, and why? For the function you pick, use the second derivative test to find its local extrema. CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 273 Finding Absolute Extrema on a Closed Interval The basic idea in this section is quite simple. Instead of finding all local extrema as in the pre- vious sections (all the peaks and all the valleys), you just want to determine the single highest point and single lowest point along a continuous function in some closed interval. These absolute extrema can occur at a peak or valley or at an edge(s) of the interval. (Note: You could have, say, two peaks at the same height so there’d be a tie for the absolute max; but there would still be exactly one y-value that’s the absolute maximum value on the interval.) A closed interval like 25, includes the endpoints 2 and 5. An open interval like ( ,)25 excludes the endpoints. Before you practice with some problems, look at Figure  11-5 to see two standard absolute extrema problems (continuous functions on a closed interval), and at Figure 11-6 for four strange functions that don’t have the standard single absolute max and single absolute min. Finding the absolute max and min is a snap. All you do is compute the critical numbers of the function in the given interval, determine the height of the function at each critical number, and then figure the height of the function at the two endpoints of the interval. The greatest of this set of heights is the absolute max; and the least, of course, is the absolute min. Here’s an example: Find the absolute max and min of h xx xcossin22 in the closed interval 2 2, . FIGURE 11-5: Two standard absolute extrema functions. 274 UNIT 4 Differentiation 1. Find the critical numbers of h in the open interval 2 2, .

CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 275 Thus, the zeros of h are 7 6 , 3 2 , and 11 6 , and because h is defined for all input numbers, this is the complete list of critical numbers. 2. Compute the function values (the heights) at each critical number. hx xx h cossin cossin .. 22 7 6 2 7 6 2 7 6 05 20 5 15 3 2 2 3 2 2 3 2 12 11 11 6 2 1 . cossin cos h h 11 6 2 11 6 05 20 51 5 sin .. . 3. Determine the function values at the endpoints of the interval. h h 2 2 2 2 2 12 13 22 22 2 cossin cossin 12 01 So, from Steps 2 and 3, you’ve found five heights: 1.5, 1, 1.5, 3, and 1. The largest number in this list, 1.5, is the absolute max; the smallest, 3, is the absolute min. The absolute max occurs at two points: 7 6 15,. and 11 6 15,. . The absolute min occurs at one of the endpoints, 2 3, , and is thus called an endpoint extremum. Table 11-1 shows the values of h xx xcossin22 at the three critical numbers in the inter- val from 2 to 2 and at the interval’s endpoints; Figure 11-7 shows the graph of h. A couple of observations. First, as you can see in Figure 11-7, the points 7 6 15,. and 11 6 15,. are both local maxima of h, and the point 3 2 1, is a local minimum of h. However, if you want only to find the absolute extrema on a closed interval, you don’t have to pay any attention to Table 11-1 Values of h xx xcossin22 at the Critical Numbers and Endpoints for the Interval 2 2, h x() 3 1.5 1 1.5 1 x 2 7 6 3 2 11 6 2 276 UNIT 4 Differentiation whether critical points are local maxes, mins, or neither. And, thus, you don’t have to bother to use the first or second derivative tests. All you have to do is determine the heights at the critical numbers and at the endpoints and then pick the largest and smallest numbers from this list. Second, the absolute max and min in the given interval tell you nothing about how the func- tion behaves outside the interval. Function h, for instance, might rise higher than 1.5 outside the interval from 2 to 2 (although it doesn’t), and it might go lower than –3 (although it never does). Q. Determine the absolute min and absolute max of fx xx in the interval 1 1 2 , . A. The absolute max is 2 and the absolute min is zero. 1. Get all the critical numbers. The first step is to determine the derivative, set it equal to zero, and solve, but before you can get the derivative, you have to split the function in two to get rid of the abso- lute value bars: I.Whenand,thus, ,xx x fx xx fx x x 0 1 2 1 0 1 2 1 2 xx x 1 1 4 II. When and, thus, xx x fx xx fx x 0 1 2 1 0 1 , 22 1 21 x x No solution Now, determine whether the derivative is undefined anywhere. The derivative is undefined at x 0 because the denominator of the derivative can’t equal zero. (If you graph this function [always a good idea], you’ll also see the sharp FIGURE 11-7: The graph of hx x x cos sin. 2 2 CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 277 9 Find the absolute extrema of fx xxsincos on the interval 02, . 10 Find the absolute extrema of gx xx23 5 32 on the interval 05 05., . . 11 Find the absolute extrema of px xx10 5 45/ . on the interval 231, . 12 Find the absolute extrema of q xx x22 4cossin on the interval 2 5 4 , . corner at x 0 and thus know immediately that the derivative is undefined there.) The critical numbers are therefore 0 and 1 4 . 2. Compute the function values (the heights) at all the critical numbers. ff 1 4 1 4 00 It’s just a coincidence, by the way, that in both cases the input equals the output. 3. Compute the function values at the two edges of the interval. ff12 1 2 2 2 1 2 0 207. 4. The highest of all the function values from Steps 2 and 3 is the absolute max; the lowest of all the values from Steps 2 and 3 is the absolute min. Thus, 2 is the absolute max and zero is the absolute min. (This particular problem was more involved than usual because of that extra twist in Step 1 involving the absolute value bars.) 278 UNIT 4 Differentiation Finding Absolute Extrema over a Function’s Entire Domain A function’s absolute max and absolute min over its entire domain are the highest and lowest val- ues (heights) of the function anywhere it’s defined. Unlike in the previous section where you saw that a continuous function must have both an absolute max and min on a closed interval, when you consider a function’s entire domain, a function can have an absolute max or min, or both, or neither. For example, the parabola y x 2 has an absolute min at the point 0, 0  — the bottom of its cup shape — but no absolute max because it goes up forever to the left and the right. You might think that its absolute max would be infinity, but infinity is not a number and thus it doesn’t qualify as a maximum (ditto for using negative infinity as an absolute min). On the one hand, the idea of a function’s very highest point and very lowest point seems pretty simple, doesn’t it? But there’s a wrench in the works. The wrench is the category of things that don’t qualify as maxes or mins. I already mentioned that infinity and negative infinity don’t qualify. Then there are empty “endpoints” like 3, 4 on fx in Figure 11-8. The function fx doesn’t have an absolute max. Its max isn’t 4 because it never gets to 4, and its max can’t be anything less than 4, like 3.999, because it gets higher than that, say 3.9999. Similarly, an infinitesimal hole in a function can’t qualify as a max or min. For example, consider the absolute value function, y x , you know, the V-shaped function with the sharp corner at the origin. The function y x has no absolute max because it goes up to infinity. Its absolute min is zero (at 0, 0 of course). But now, say you alter the function slightly by plucking out the point at 0, 0 and leaving an infinitesimal hole there. Now the function has no absolute minimum. Now consider gx in Figure 11-8. It shows another type of situation that doesn’t qualify as a min (or max). The function gx has no absolute min. Going left, g crawls along the horizontal asymptote at y 0, always getting lower and lower, but never getting as low as zero. Since it never gets to zero, zero can’t be the absolute min, and there can’t be any other absolute min (like, say, 0.0001) because at some point way to the left, g will get below any small number you can name. Keeping this in mind, here’s an approach for locating a function’s absolute maximum and minimum (if there are any): 1. Find the height of the function at each of its critical numbers; in other words, find the function’s critical points. (Recall that a function’s critical numbers are the x-values within the function’s domain where the derivative is zero or undefined; critical points are the points on the function corresponding to the critical numbers.) If a function has an absolute max and/or min, each must occur at a critical point, so, once you have all of a function’s critical points, you have all of the candidates for an absolute max and an absolute min. You just did something similar in Step 1 of both examples in the previous section, but this time you consider all the critical points, not just those in a given interval. The highest of these points will be the function’s absolute max unless the function goes higher than that point, in which case the function won’t have an absolute max. The lowest of those points will be the function’s absolute min unless the function goes CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 279 lower than that point, in which case it won’t have an absolute min. If you apply Step 1 to gx in Figure 11-8, you’ll find that it has no critical points. When this happens, you’re done. The function has neither an absolute max nor an absolute min. 2. Graph the function to see how high and low it goes. Look at the graph of the function. If you see that the function gets higher than the highest of its critical points, it has no absolute max; if it goes lower than the lowest of its critical points, it has no absolute min. Applying Steps 1 and 2 to fx in Figure 11-8, Step 1 would reveal two critical points: the endpoint at 31, (where the first derivative is undefined) and the local max at roughly 41 13., . (where the first derivative equals zero). Those two critical points are the only candidates for an absolute min or max. But then in Step 2, you’d see that f goes higher than the higher of the critical points, 41 13., . , and that it, therefore, has no absolute max; and you’d see that f goes lower than the lower of the critical points, 31, , and, thus, that it has no absolute min. 3. Use the first derivative test and a sign graph to analyze the shape of the function. You may have your final answer after finishing Step 2 (as in this example), but if any candidates for an absolute max or min remain after finishing Step 2, you may want to use a sign graph to analyze the shape of the function — especially its end behavior (what happens to a function way to the left and way to the right) — before you can positively conclude whether there is an absolute max and/or min. Q. Find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of fx xxln over its entire domain. A. The absolute maximum is 11, and f has no absolute minimum. 1. Find all of the function’s critical points. To find the critical points of f, first set the derivative of f equal to zero and solve: fx xx fx x x x ln 1 1 0 1 1 1 FIGURE 11-8: Two functions with no absolute extrema. 280 UNIT 4 Differentiation So, 1 is a critical number. And don’t forget that you always have to also check for any x-values where the derivative is undefined. The derivative, 1 1 x , is undefined at x 0, but 0 is not in f’s domain, so 0 is not a critical number. Thus, 1 is the only critical number. Plugging 1 into f gives you f’s only critical point. f 11 1 1 ln Thus, f’s critical point is at 11, . This is the only candidate for an absolute max or min. 2. Looking at the graph of f, you can see f curving down from 11, to the left and to the right. Since 11, is the only candidate for an absolute max or a min, you can conclude that f has no absolute min. And it certainly appears from the graph that 11, is the absolute max, but you should confirm that in Step 3. 3. The only critical number is x 1, so that’s the only number on your sign graph. Testing any number between 0 and 1 in the derivative produces a positive result (x-values less than or equal to 0 are not in f’s domain), and testing any number greater than 1 produces a negative result. That tells you that f is increasing every- where between 0 and 1 and decreasing everywhere from 1 to infinity. Thus, 11, is the absolute maximum. 13 Find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of fx xx 422 over its entire domain. CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 281 14 Find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of functions A, B, C, and D shown in the following figure. Locating Concavity and Inflection Points Look back at the function fx xx320 53 in Figure  11-2. You used the three critical numbers of f, –2, 0, and 2, to find the function’s local extrema: 2, 64 and 264, . This section investigates what happens elsewhere on this function — specifically, where it’s concave up or down and where the concavity switches (the inflection points). 282 UNIT 4 Differentiation The process for finding concavity and inflection points is analogous to using the first derivative test and the sign graph to find local extrema, except that now you use the second derivative. (See the section “Finding Local Extrema — My Ma, She’s Like, Totally Extreme.”) Here’s what you do to find the intervals of concavity and the inflection points of fx xx320 53: 1. Find the second derivative of f. fx xx fx x fx x 320 15 60 60 120 53 42 3 (the power rule) (the power rule) 2. Set the second derivative equal to zero and solve. 60 120 0 60 20 3 2 xx xx 600 20 02 2 2 2 xx xx x or 3. Determine whether the second derivative is undefined for any x-values. fx x60 120 3 is defined for all real numbers, so there are no other x-values to add to the list from Step 2. Thus, the complete list is 2, 0, and 2 . Steps 2 and 3 give you what you could call “second derivative critical numbers” of f because they’re analogous to the critical numbers of f that you find using the first derivative. But, as far as I’m aware, this set of numbers has no special name. The important thing to know is that this list is made up of the zeros of f plus any x-values where f is undefined. 4. Plot these numbers on a number line and test the regions with the second derivative. Use 2, 1, 1, and 2 as test numbers. fx x f f f x 60 120 240 60 2 1 1 3 (neg.) (pos.) 60 2402 (neg.) (pos.)f Figure 11-9 shows the sign graph. FIGURE 11-9: A second derivative sign graph for fx xx320 53. CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 283 A positive sign on this sign graph tells you that the function is concave up in that interval; negative means concave down. The function has an inflection point (usually) at any x-value where the signs switch from positive to negative or vice versa. Because the signs switch at 2, 0, and 2 , and because these three numbers are zeros of f , inflection points occur at these x-values. If, however, you have a problem where the signs switch at a number where f is undefined, you have to check one additional thing before concluding that there’s an inflection point there. An inflection point exists at a given x-value only if you can draw a tangent line to the function at that number. This is the case if the first derivative exists at that number or if the tangent line is vertical there; both of these situations are covered by a simple rule: If the concavity switches at a point where the curve is smooth, you have an inflection point there. All inflection points have a second derivative of zero (if the second derivative exists), but not all points with a second derivative of zero are inflection points. This is no different from “all ships are boats but not all boats are ships.” (For example, y x 4, which resembles a parabola, has a second derivative equal to zero at the point 00, , but that point is not an inflection point — it’s a local minimum.) 5. Plug these three x-values into f to obtain the function values of the three inflection points. fx xx f f f 320 2396 00 2396 53 . . The square root of 2 equals about 1.4, so there are inflection points at about 14 39 6., . , 0, 0 , and about 14 39 6., . . You’re done. Figure 11-10 shows f’s inflection points as well as its local extrema and its intervals of concavity. 15 Find the intervals of concavity and the inflection points of fx xx x26 10 5 32 . 16 Find the intervals of concavity and the inflection points of gx xx 4212 . 284 UNIT 4 Differentiation 17 Find the intervals of concavity and the inflection points of px x x 2 9 . 18 Find the intervals of concavity and the inflection points of q xx x 53 . You’ll want to use your calculator for this one. FIGURE 11-10: A graph of fx xx320 53 showing its local extrema, its inflection points, and its intervals of concavity. CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 285 Looking at Graphs of Derivatives Till They Derive You Crazy You can learn a lot about functions and their derivatives by looking at their graphs side by side and comparing their important features. Let’s keep going with the same function, fx xx320 53; you’re going to travel along f from left to right (see Figure 11-11), pausing to note its points of interest and also observing what’s happening to the graph of fx x15 60 42 at the same points. But first, check out the following (long) warning. This is NOT the function! As you look at the graph of f in Figure 11-11, or the graph of any other derivative, you may need to slap yourself in the face every minute or so to remind yourself that “This is the derivative I’m looking at, not the function!” You’ve looked at hundreds and hundreds of graphs of functions over the years, so when you start looking at graphs of deriva- tives, you can easily lapse into thinking of them as regular functions. You might, for instance, look at an interval that’s going up on the graph of a derivative and mistakenly conclude that the original function must also be going up in the same interval — an understandable mis- take. You know the first derivative is the same thing as slope. So, when you see the graph of the first derivative going up, you may think, “Oh, the first derivative (the slope) is going up, FIGURE 11-11: fx x320 53 and its first derivative, fx x15 60 42. 286 UNIT 4 Differentiation and when the slope goes up that’s like going up a hill, so the original function must be rising.” This sounds reasonable because, loosely speaking, you can describe the front side of a hill as a slope that’s going up, increasing. But mathematically speaking, the front side of a hill has a positive slope, not necessarily an increasing slope. So, where a function is increasing, the graph of its derivative will be positive, but that derivative graph might be going up or down. Say you’re going up a hill. As you approach the top of the hill, you’re still going up, but, in general, the slope (the steepness) is going down. It might be 3, then 2, then 1, and then, at the top of the hill, the slope is zero. So, the slope is getting smaller or decreasing, even as you’re climbing the hill or increasing. In such an interval, the graph of the function is increasing, but the graph of its derivative is decreasing. Got that? Okay, let’s get back to the f and its derivative in Figure 11-11. Beginning on the left and travel- ing toward the right, f increases until the local max at 2, 64 . It’s going up, so its slope is positive, but f is getting less and less steep, so its slope is decreasing — the slope decreases until it becomes zero at the peak. This corresponds to the graph of f (the slope), which is positive (because it’s above the x-axis) but decreasing as it goes down to the point 2, 0 . Let’s sum- marize your entire trip along f and f with the following list of rules. Rules are rules: » An increasing interval on a function corresponds to an interval on the graph of its derivative that’s positive (or zero for a single point if the function has a horizontal inflec- tion point). In other words, a function’s increasing interval corresponds to a part of the derivative graph that’s above the x-axis (or that touches the axis for a single point in the case of a horizontal inflection point). See intervals A and F in Figure 11-11. » A local max on the graph of a function (like 2, 64 ) corresponds to a zero — an x-intercept — on an interval of the graph of its derivative that crosses the x-axis going down (like at 2, 0 ). » On a derivative graph, you’ve got an m-axis. When you’re looking at various points on the derivative graph, don’t forget that the y-coordinate of a point, like 2, 0 , on a graph of a first derivative tells you the slope of the original function, not its height. Think of the y-axis on the first derivative graph as the slope-axis or the m-axis; you could think of general points on the first derivative graph as having coordinates xm, . » A decreasing interval on a function corresponds to a negative interval on the graph of the derivative (or zero for a single point if the function has a horizontal inflection point). The negative interval on the derivative graph is below the x-axis (or in the case of a horizon- tal inflection point, the derivative graph touches the x-axis at a single point). See intervals B, C, D, and E in Figure 11-11 (but consider them as a single section), where f goes down all the way from the local max at 2, 64 to the local min at 264, and where f is negative between 2, 0 and 2, 0 except for at the point 0, 0 on f which corresponds to the horizontal inflection point on f. » A local min on the graph of a function corresponds to a zero (an x-intercept) on an interval of the graph of its derivative that crosses the x-axis going up (like at 2, 0 ). CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 287 Now let’s take a second trip along f to consider its intervals of concavity and its inflection points. First, consider intervals A and B in Figure  11-11. The graph of f is concave down  — which means the same thing as a decreasing slope — until it gets to the inflection point at about 14 39 6., . . So, the graph of f decreases until it bottoms out at about 14., 60 . These coordinates tell you that the inflection point at 14. on f has a slope of 60. Note that the inflection point on f at 14 39 6., . is the steepest point on that stretch of the function, but it has the smallest slope because its slope is a larger negative than the slope at any other nearby point. Between 14 39 6., . and the next inflection point at 0, 0 , f is concave up, which means the same thing as an increasing slope. So, the graph of f increases from about 14. to where it hits a local max at 0, 0 . See interval C in Figure 11-11. Let’s take a break from our trip for some more rules. More rules: » A concave down interval on the graph of a function corresponds to a decreasing inter- val on the graph of its derivative (intervals A, B, and D in Figure 11-11). And a concave up interval on the function corresponds to an increasing interval on the derivative (intervals C, E, and F). » An inflection point on a function (except for a vertical inflection point where the deriv- ative is undefined) corresponds to a local extremum on the graph of its derivative. An inflection point of minimum slope (in its neighborhood) corresponds to a local min on the derivative graph; an inflection point of maximum slope (in its neighborhood) corresponds to a local max on the derivative graph. Resuming our trip, after 0, 0 , f is concave down till the inflection point at about 14 39 6., .  — this corresponds to the decreasing section of f from 0, 0 to its min at 14., 60 (interval D in Figure 11-11). Finally, f is concave up the rest of the way, which corresponds to the increasing section of f beginning at 14., 60 (intervals E and F in the figure). Well, that pretty much brings you to the end of the road. Going back and forth between the graphs of a function and its derivative can be very trying at first. If your head starts to spin, take a break and come back to this stuff later. If I haven’t already succeeded in deriving you crazy — aren’t these calculus puns fantastic? — perhaps this final point will do the trick. Look again at the graph of the derivative, f , in Figure  11-11 and also at the sign graph for f in Figure  11-9. That sign graph, because it’s a second derivative sign graph, bears exactly (well, almost exactly) the same relationship to the graph of f as a first derivative sign graph bears to the graph of a regular function. In other words, negative intervals on the sign graph in Figure 11-9 (to the left of 2 and between zero and 2 ) show you where the graph of f is decreasing; positive intervals on the sign graph (between 2 and zero and to the right of 2 ) show you where f is increasing. And points where the signs switch from positive to negative or vice versa (at 2 , zero, and 2 ) show you where f has local extrema. Clear as mud, right? 288 UNIT 4 Differentiation 19 Given the graph of the derivative of f shown in the following figure, and the fact that f contains the points 2, 0 , 0, 2 , and 2, 0 , sketch a graph of f showing its local extrema, its inflection points, and where it’s concave up and concave down. 20 Given the graph of the derivative of g shown in the following figure, and the fact that g contains the point 0, 1 , sketch a graph of g and identify the location of its x-intercepts. CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 289 The Mean Value Theorem — Go Ahead, Make My Day You won’t use the Mean Value Theorem a lot, but it’s a famous theorem — one of the two or three most important in all of calculus — so you really should learn it. It’s very simple and has a nice connection to the Mean Value Theorem for integrals, which I show you in Chapter 17. Look at Figure 11-12. Here’s the formal definition of the theorem. The Mean Value Theorem: If f is continuous on the closed interval ab, and differentiable on the open interval ab, , then there exists at least one number c in ab, such that fc fb fa ba Now for the plain-English version. First, you need to take care of the fine print. The require- ments in the theorem that the function be continuous and differentiable guarantee that the function is a regular, smooth function without things like gaps or corners. Most (but not all) ordinary functions will satisfy these requirements, but don’t neglect to check that they are in fact satisfied. (Keep your eyes peeled on quizzes and tests for functions that don’t satisfy these requirements.) Here’s what the theorem means. The secant line connecting points af a, and bf b, in Figure 11-12 has a slope given by the slope formula: Slope yy xx fb fa ba 21 21 FIGURE 11-12: An illustration of the Mean Value Theorem. 290 UNIT 4 Differentiation Note that this is the same as the right side of the equation in the Mean Value Theorem. The derivative at a point is the same thing as the slope of the tangent line at that point, so the theorem just says that there must be at least one point between a and b where the slope of the tangent is the same as the slope of the secant line from a to b. The result is parallel lines, like in Figure 11-12. Why must this be so? Here’s a visual argument. Imagine that you grab the secant line con- necting af a, and bf b, , and then you slide it up, keeping it parallel to the original secant line. Can you see that the two points of intersection between this sliding line and the function — the two points that begin at af a, and bf b,  — will gradually get closer and closer to each other until they come together at cf c, ? If you raise the line any further, you break away from the function entirely. At this last point of intersection, cf c, , the sliding line touches the function at a single point and is thus tangent to the function there, and it has the same slope as the original secant line. Well, that does it. This explanation is a bit oversim- plified, but it’ll do. Here’s a completely different sort of argument that should appeal to your common sense. If the function in Figure  11-12 gives your car’s odometer reading as a function of time, then the slope of the secant line from a to b gives your average speed during that interval of time, because dividing the distance traveled, fb fa , by the elapsed time, b a, gives you the average speed. The point cf c, , guaranteed by the Mean Value Theorem, is a point where your instantaneous speed — given by the derivative fc  — equals your average speed. Now, imagine that you take a drive and you average 50 miles per hour. The Mean Value Theo- rem says that there must be at least one point during your trip when your speed was exactly 50 mph. But you don’t need a fancy-pants calculus theorem to tell you that. It’s just common sense. Think about it. Your average speed can’t be 50 mph if you go slower than 50 the whole way or if you go faster than 50 the whole way. To average 50 mph, either you go exactly 50 for the whole drive, or you have to go slower than 50 for part of the drive and faster than 50 at other times. In the former case, the theorem is obviously satisfied because you’re driving at exactly 50 at every point in time. And in the latter case, the theorem is also satisfied because when you speed up or slow down from going slower than 50 to going faster than 50 (or vice versa), you have to hit exactly 50 mph at some point. You can’t jump over 50 — like going 49 one moment then 51 the next — because speeds go up by sliding up the scale, not jumping. At some point, your speedometer slides past 50, and for at least one instant, you’re going exactly 50 mph. That’s all the Mean Value Theorem says. With the Mean Value Theorem, you figure an average rate or slope over an interval and then use the first derivative to find one or more points in the interval where the instantaneous rate or slope equals the average rate or slope. Here’s an example: Q. Given fx xx x 3245 , find all numbers c in the open interval 24, where the instantaneous rate equals the average rate over the interval. A. The only answer is 42 7 3 . Basically, you’re finding the points along the curve in the interval where the slope is the same as the slope from 22, f to 44, f . Mathematically speaking, you find all numbers c where fc ff42 42 .

Draw your sign graph. 6. Determine whether there’s a local min or max or neither at each critical number. f goes down to where x 0 and then up, so there’s a local min at x 0, and f goes up to where x 1 and then down, so there’s a local max at x 1.

Note, however, that t 0 is not a critical number of s because s is undefined at t 0. And because there is no point on s at t 0, there can’t be a local extremum at t 0. 3.

Therefore, there’s no local extremum at t 0. Remember that if a problem asks you to identify only the x-values and not the y-values of the local extrema, and you only consider the sign graph, you will incorrectly conclude — using the current problem as an example — that there’s a local min at t 0. So you should always check where your function is undefined. s 2 24 22 2 4 2 . Up, then down again, so there’s another local max at 22, .

Plug in the critical numbers (from Problem 2). h h 44 2 2 3 4 3 4 2 2 coscos You’re done. You determine that h is concave down at x 4 , so there’s a local max there, and h is concave up at x 3 4 , so there’s a local min at that x-value. (In Problem 2, you already determined the y-values for these extrema.) Note that h is an example of a function where the second derivative test is quick and easy.

The second derivative test fails at x 0, so you have to use the first derivative test for that critical number. When the first derivative test may be preferable. If — as in the function for this problem — one of the critical numbers is x 0, and you can quickly see that the second derivative will equal zero at x 0 (because, for example, all the terms of the second derivative will be simple powers of x), then the second derivative test will fail for x 0, and you might want to use the first derivative test instead. However, because this problem involves a continuous function and because there’s only one critical number between the two maxes you found, the only possibility is that there’s a min at x 0. (Try this streetwise logic out on your teacher and let me know if it works.) 8 Your pick should be s tt 8 21 4 7 4 3 ; local min at 14 5,. and local max at 1115,. . The second derivative test fails where the second derivative is undefined (in addition to fail- ing where the second derivative equals zero). To pick, look at the first derivative of each function: yx s tt y x 2 23 3 88 21 4 7 4 2 3 / 22 13 2 2 13 82 21 4 21 4 4 38 / / xs t x x Do you see the trouble you’re going to run into with y x ? The first derivative is undefined at x 22 . And the second derivative will also be undefined at those x-values, because when you take the second derivative with the quotient rule, squaring the bottom, the denominator will contain that same factor, x 2 8 . The second derivative test will thus fail at 22 , and you’ll have to use the first derivative test. In contrast to y x , the second derivative test works great with st : 1.

If you divide both sides of an equation by something that can equal zero at one or more x-values (like you did here when dividing both sides by cos x), you may miss one or more solutions. You have to check whether any of those x-values is a solution. In this problem, cos x 0 at 2 and 3 2 , and it’s easy to check (in Line 4 of Step 1) that sin x does not equal cos x at either of those values, so there’s no problem here. But if sin x did equal cos x at either of those values, you’d have one or two more solutions and one or two more critical numbers. (Note that you have to check any such values in the line of the solution immediately above the line where you do the dividing — the way you just used Line 4; you couldn’t use Line 5 for the check.) 300 UNIT 4 Differentiation 2.

Find the height of the function at each of its critical numbers; in other words, find the func- tion’s critical points. fx xx fx xx xx xx x 42 3 2 2 44 41 41 1 So, x 0, x 1, and x 1 are the critical numbers, and, since f 00 20 0 42 , f 11 21 1 42 , and f 11 21 1 42 , the critical points of f are 11, , 0, , 0 and 11, . That’s the complete list of candidates for the absolute extrema of f. When you look at a graph of f, you’ll see that its absolute min of –1 occurs at two points, 11, and 11, . And, because f obviously rises higher than the highest of the critical points, 0, 0 , f has no absolute max. A graph of f makes this solution obvious, but, if you want to be thorough, you should confirm that the absolute min is –1 with the first derivative test. That will show that f decreases from negative infinity to –1, then increases from –1 to 0, then decreases from 0 to 1, and, finally, increases from 1 to infinity. That confirms that fact that f never gets below –1. CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 303 14 (a) Function A has neither an absolute max nor an absolute min. As I’m sure you know, when you see an arrow like the one on the left on function A, you have to assume that that line (actually a ray with an open endpoint) continues in the direction shown indefinitely. Duh. Okay, so function A goes up forever to the left. And, thus — since infinity does not qualify as a max — function A has no absolute max. Nor does it have an absolute min. You can see that the function goes down to the hollow dot at –1. If that dot were solid, the absolute min would be –1. But because it’s hollow, there is no absolute min. Is the min –0.99999? No, function A goes below that: say, to –0.999999999. No matter what number you pick above –1 as a candidate for the absolute minimum, I can always give you another number below your candidate number and above –1. So, no number can qualify as the absolute minimum. (b) Function B has no absolute max. Its absolute min is –1. (c) Function C has no absolute max. Its absolute min is –1. (d) The absolute maximum of Function D is 1. This maximum height occurs at 01, and at all x-values in the interval , 2 along the line y 1. Function D has no absolute minimum. 15 The function f is concave up from negative infinity to the inflection point at 11, , then concave down from there to positive infinity. 1.

Hint: To get a good feel for the look of this function, you need a fairly odd graphing window — try something like Xmin = –2, Xmax = 4, Ymin = –20, Ymax = 20. 16 The function g is concave up from negative infinity to the inflection point at 220, , then concave down to an inflection point at 220, , then concave up again to infinity. 1.

(At each of the three inflection points, you’d be going straight for an infinitesimal moment.) 18 Concave down from negative infinity till an inflection point at about –. ,– .0 085 0 171 , then concave up till a vertical inflection point at 00, , then concave down till a third inflection point at about 0 085 0 171., . , then concave up out to infinity. You know the routine. qx xx qx xx q xx x 53 45 23 95 53 1 5 1 3 4 25 2 9 0 // // 44 25 2 9 95 53xx // CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 307 Whoops, I guess this algebra’s kind of messy. Better get the zeros on your calculator: Just graph and find the x-intercepts. There are two: x 0 085. and x 0 085. . So you have two “critical numbers,” right? Wrong! Don’t forget to check for undefined points of the second derivative. Because q x xx 4 25 2 9 95 53// , q is undefined at x 0. Since q x is defined at x 0, zero is another “critical number.” So, you have three “critical numbers” and four regions. You can test them with –1, –0.01, 0.01, and 1: q xx x 4 25 2 9 95 53// q qq q1 14 225 001 158 001 158 1 14 225 .. Thus the concavity goes down, up, down, up. Because the second derivative is zero at –0.085 and 0.085, and because the concavity switches there, you can conclude that there are inflec- tion points at those two x-values. But because both the first and second derivatives are unde- fined at x 0, you have to check whether there’s a vertical tangent there. You can see that there is by just looking at the graph, but if you want to be rigorous about it, you figure the limit of the first derivative as x approaches zero. Since that equals infinity, you have a vertical tangent at x 0, and thus there’s an inflection point there. Now plug –0.085, 0, and 0.085 into q to get the y-values, and you’re done. 19 Absolute precision is not the point of this exercise, but your graph should look close to the graph of f shown here. Note the following features of the graph of f. Your graph should show local mins at 20, and 20, and a local max at 0, 2 . And your graph should show inflection points at roughly 1, 1 and 1, 1 . Finally, your graph should show that f is concave up everywhere to the left of 1, 1 and everywhere to the right of 1, 1 . In between those points, f should be concave down. 308 UNIT 4 Differentiation 20 Unlike with Problem 19, your graph of g for this problem should be precisely what is shown here. You were given that g contains the point 0, 1 , and the graph of g shows that the derivative of g (its slope) is zero between –1 and 1. These facts tell you that there’s a section of g that’s a hor- izontal line between 1, 1 and 1, 1 . To the left of –1, the graph of g shows that the derivative (the slope) equals 1. Thus, going left from 1, 1 , g must go down one, left one, crossing the x-axis at –2. The logic is very similar going right from 1, 1 to the x-intercept at 2. 21 The values of c are 17 3 and 17 3 . 1. Find the first derivative. gx xx x gx xx 32 232 1 2.

CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 311 Answers to Chapter 11 Quiz 1 There’s a local min at 01, . That’s the only local extremum. 1. Find the first derivative of f using the e x rule and the power rule. fx ex fx e x x 1 2. Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x to get the critical numbers of f. e ex x x 10 1 0 If the first derivative were undefined for some x-value(s) in the domain of f, there could be more critical numbers, but because fx e x 1 is defined for all real numbers, 0 is the only critical number of f. 3. Plot the single critical number on a number line, noting that it creates two regions. I’m going to skip the figure for this problem, because it’s so simple. You should have an ordinary number line with a single point marked at x 0. 4. Plug a number from each of the two regions into the derivative, noting whether the results are positive or negative. fx e f f x 1 any negative numbernegative any positive nuumberpositive 5. Draw a sign graph. Take your number line and label each region, based on your results from Step 4 — positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing). Let’s skip this simple figure as well. Your sign graph should be a number line with a minus sign over the negative side of the line and a plus sign over the positive side of the line. This sign graph tells you that f is decreasing from negative infinity to zero and increasing from zero to positive infinity. 6. Use the sign graph to determine whether there’s a local minimum, local maximum, or neither at each critical number. Because f goes down on its way from negative infinity to x 0 and up after x 0, it must bottom out at x 0, so there’s a local min there. 7. Determine the y-value of the local min by plugging the x-value into the original function. fe00 1 0 So, the local min is at 01, . That’s the only local extremum. 312 UNIT 4 Differentiation 2 There’s a local min at 2 2 1 2 1 2 2,ln . That’s the only local extremum. 1. Find the first derivative of g using the power rule and the natural log rule. gx xx gx x x 2 2 1 ln 2. Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x to get the critical numbers of g. 2 1 0 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 x x x x x x You can disregard 2 2 because that’s outside g’s domain. You can also disregard the fact that g is undefined at x 0 because zero is also outside the domain. Thus, 2 2 is the only critical number of g. 3. Plot the critical number, 2 2 , on a number line, and also put a hollow dot at x 0 to show that that’s the end of g’s domain, namely, the interval 0, . 4. Plug a number from each of the two regions into the derivative, noting whether the results are positive or negative. gx x x g g 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 12 1 1 1 1 5. Draw a sign graph. Take your number line and label each region, based on your results from Step 4 — positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing). See the following sign graph. CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 313 6. Use the sign graph to determine whether there’s a local minimum, local maximum, or neither at each critical number. Because g goes down from zero to 2 2 and up from there, it must bottom out at x 2 2 , so there’s a local min there. 7. Determine the y-value of the local min by plugging the x-value into the original function. gx xx g 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 ln ln ln (Did you follow that simplification I did with the ln 2 2 ? See if you can work it out.) So, the local min is at 2 2 1 2 1 2 2,ln , or roughly 0 707., 0.847 . That’s the only local extremum. 3 There’s a local min at x 0. 1. Find the critical numbers. You have the single critical number from Problem 1: x 0. 2. Get the second derivative. fx ex fx e fx e x x x 1 3. Plug the critical number into the second derivative. fe01 0 This positive result tells you that f is concave up at x 0, and, therefore, that there’s a local min there. This confirms your result from Problem 1. 4 There’s a local min at x 2 2 . 1. Find the critical numbers. You have the critical number from Problem 2. The only critical number of g is x 2 2 . 2. Get the second derivative. gx xx gx x x gx x 2 2 2 1 2 1 ln 314 UNIT 4 Differentiation 3. Plug the critical number into the second derivative. g 2 2 2 1 2 2 22 4 2 This positive result tells you that g is concave up at x 2 2 , and, therefore, that there’s a local min there. This confirms your result from Problem 2. 5 The absolute max occurs at 2 12 2, e e . The absolute min occurs at 02, . 1. Find the critical numbers of f in the open interval ln ,22 . fx ee f xee ee ee x xx xx xx xx 0 0 Thus, x 0 is the only zero of f (in the given interval or anywhere else, for that matter), and because f is defined for all input numbers, zero is the only critical number. 2. Compute the function value (the height) at the critical number. fx ee fe e xx 02 00 3. Determine the function values at the endpoints of the interval. fx ee fe e fe e e e xx ln . ln ln2 1 2 22 5 2 1 22 22 2 2 So, from Steps 2 and 3, you’ve found three heights: 2, 2.5, and e e 2 2 1 . The largest number in this list, e e 2 2 1 , is the absolute max; the smallest, 2, is the absolute min. The absolute max occurs at 2 12 2, e e , an endpoint extremum. The absolute min occurs at 0, 2 . CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 315 6 The absolute max occurs at both 11, and 11, . The absolute min occurs at 00, . 1. Find the critical numbers of f in the open interval 11, . gx e gx e ex x x x x x x ln 2 2 21 2 2 02 0 Just like in Problem 5, x 0 is the only zero of g (in the given interval or anywhere else), and because g is defined for all input numbers, zero is the only critical number. 2. Compute the function value (the height) at the critical number. gx e ge xln ln ln 2 2 0 10 0 3. Determine the function values at the endpoints of the interval. gx e ge e g xln ln ln 2 2 1 1 11 1 So, from Steps 2 and 3, you’ve found three heights (two different heights): 0, 1, and 1 again. The largest number in this list, 1, is the absolute max; the smallest, 0, is the abso- lute min. The absolute max occurs at both 1, 1 and 1, 1 . The absolute min occurs at 0, 0 . This was a trick problem of sorts. I went through the hard-way solution here, thinking that many might not have seen the following easy way. Congrats if you saw that ln ex x 2 2, and, thus, that gx x 2, the simple parabola you know well. And the absolute max and min of gx x 2 on the interval 11, should be obvious without doing any calculus. 316 UNIT 4 Differentiation 7 f xx x 3 2 has an absolute max at 0 341 0 582., . . It has no absolute min. 1. Find the height of the function at each of its critical numbers; in other words, find the function’s critical points. fx xx fx xx xx xx x x 3 2 23 23 23 53 35 1 3 2 2 1 3 6 1 6 1 6 So, 1 6 0 341 35 . is a critical number. Zero is another critical number, because f is unde- fined at x 0. The heights at those critical numbers are 5 6 1 6 0 582 15 . and zero, respec- tively. Those are your only candidates for an absolute max and an absolute min. 2. Graph the function to see how high and low it goes. You can see from the graph of f that it never goes above 0.341, 0.582 , so that’s the absolute max. And f obviously goes below the other critical point at 00, , so f has no absolute min. 3. Use the first derivative test and a sign graph to analyze the shape of the function. You should confirm your absolute max result from Step 2, by using the first derivative test. That will show that f is rising from negative infinity until 0.341, 0.582 and falling from there to infinity. That clinches it. 8 gx x 24 has no absolute max. Its absolute min is at 00, . 1. Find the height of the function at each of its critical numbers; in other words, find the function’s critical points. gx x x gx xx x x x xx 24 2 14 2 34 64 24 1 4 2 22 or The derivative g is undefined at x 0, so that’s a critical number of g; g has no zeros, so x 0 is the only critical number. Plugging zero into g gives you 00, for the only critical point on g and your only candidate for an absolute max or min. (By the way, as you may have noticed, gx x 24 is a peculiar function. When you graph it, you’ll see that it’s the same as the ordinary square root function, fx x , in the first quadrant with another branch symmetric to that in the second quadrant. You’ve got to be CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 317 very careful when doing the derivative of g. There are a few ways to go awry. For example, you’ll get the wrong derivative if you simplify the second line to x 12.) 2. Graph the function to see how high and low it goes. You can see from the graph of g that it never goes below 00, , so that’s the absolute min. And g obviously goes above 00, , so g has no absolute max. 9 f xx xcos 1 2 2 is concave up everywhere. It has no inflection points. Find the second derivative, set it equal to zero, and solve: fx xx fx xx fx x x x x cos sin cos cos cos 1 2 1 01 1 2 22kk ( is any integer) Don’t forget to also check for any x-values where the second derivative is undefined. There are none. So, the zeros of f are the only numbers you need to consider for this concavity- and-inflection-point inquiry. Notice that fx xcos1 will be positive for all input values, except when x equals a mul- tiple of 2 . At those multiples, the second derivative equals zero. Consider one of those zeros, say, x 2 . To the left of x 2 , f is concave up (because f is positive). And to the right of x 2 , f is also concave up. And that means that f is concave up at x 2 as well. This applies to all the zeros of f , and, thus, f is concave up everywhere. I find this a fascinating function. Graph it and take a look at it. Close in, it looks sort of like a parabola, but with a very flat bottom. Then, as you zoom out, it more closely resembles the simple parabola y x 1 2 2. But at every multiple of 2 along the function, where f equals zero, the curve sort of straightens out for an infinitesimal moment (these straighter stretches are very difficult to see, but if you look very carefully using the right scale, you can make them out). Interesting! 10 gx xx25 64 is concave up on two intervals: ,1 and 1, . The function g is con- cave down on the interval 11, ; g has inflection points at 13, and 13, . Find the second derivative, set it equal to zero, and solve: gx xx gx xx gx xx xx 25 12 20 60 60 06060 060 64 53 42 42 xxx xx x 22 2 1 0601 1 x 01 1,, and Check for any x-values where the second derivative is undefined. There are none, so –1, 0, and 1 are your “second derivative critical numbers.” They divide the number line into four 318 UNIT 4 Differentiation intervals: , 1 , 1, 0 , 01, , and 1, . Test any number from each interval in the second derivative: gx xx x g g 60 11 2 05 2 posneg negpos .pposneg posneg posneg posneg pos g g 05 2 . pospos pos These results tell you that g is concave up from negative infinity to –1, concave down from –1 to 1, and concave up again from 1 to infinity. Because the concavity switches signs at –1 and 1, there are inflection points at those x-values. 11 (a) The MVT does not apply. Hope you didn’t fall for this trap. The MVT does not apply here, because fx x 1 1 is not continuous over the interval 02, . (b) The MVT does not apply. Another trap problem (with a twist). The MVT does not apply here, because gx x 3 is not everywhere differentiable on the open interval 1, 1 . The first derivative, gx x 1 3 23 , is undefined at x 0. The twist here is that if you go ahead and do the MVT math, you’ll correctly find two values for c, namely, 3 9 , where the derivative (the slope of the tangent line) does in fact equal the slope of the secant line from 1, 1 to 1, 1 (the points on the function at the endpoints of the given interval). So, the MVT did work correctly. My hunch is that the MVT will work for a larger class of functions than are technically allowed by the theorem — namely, all continuous and smooth functions without any corners or cusps. Bottom line: Never mind this! Go by the book. That’s what your professor will expect. 12 For gx x 3 in the interval 08, , c 83 9 satisfies the MVT. Unlike in Problem 11b, gx x 3 does satisfy the MVT fine print over the interval 08, . Note that the MVT requires that the function be continuous on the closed interval 08, , which gx x 3 is. But gx x 3 needs to be differentiable only over the open interval 0, 8  — which it is. The fact that gx x 3 is not differentiable at x 0 — which was the hitch in Problem 11b — is irrelevant here. CHAPTER 11 Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 319 By the MVT, gc gb ga ba . You’ve got a 0 and b 8; determine the three other things you need here, so you can plug them in. gx x 1 3 23 so gc c 1 3 23 . g g 00 0 88 2 3 3 Plug everything into the MVT formula and finish: 1 3 20 80 1 3 1 4 83 9 23 23 c c c , etc. You can reject the negative answer, because it’s outside the given interval. CHAPTER 12 Your Problems Are Solved: Differentiation to the Rescue! 321 Your Problems Are Solved: Differentiation to the Rescue! I n Chapter 1, I argue that calculus has changed the world in countless ways, that its impact is not limited to Ivory Tower mathematics, but is all around us in down-to-earth things like microwave ovens, cellphones, and cars. Well, it’s now Chapter 12, and I’m finally ready to show you how to use calculus to solve some practical problems. Getting the Most (or Least) Out of Life: Optimization Problems One of the most practical uses of differentiation is finding the maximum or minimum value of a real-world function: the maximum output of a factory, the maximum strength of a beam, the minimum cost of running some business, the maximum range of a missile, and so on. Let’s see how this works by walking through some problems. Chapter 12 IN THIS CHAPTER » Getting the most bang for your buck — optimization problems » Getting up to speed with position, velocity, and acceleration » Related rates — brace yourself 322 UNIT 4 Differentiation The maximum volume of a box A box with no top is to be manufactured from a 30-inch-by-30-inch piece of cardboard by cut- ting and folding it, as shown in Figure 12-1. What dimensions will produce a box with the maximum volume? Mathematics often seems abstract and impractical, but here’s an honest-to-goodness practical problem (well . . . almost). If a manufacturer can sell bigger boxes for more and is making 100,000 boxes, you’d better believe they want the exact answer to this question. Here’s how you do it: 1. Express the thing you want maximized, the volume, as a function of the unknown, the height of the box (which is the same as the length of the cut). Vl wh V hh hh30 2302 (You can see in Figure 12-1 thaat both the andequallength widthh hh h 30 2 900 120 4 4 2 .) hhh h 32120 900 2. Determine the domain of your function. The height can’t be negative, and because the length (and width) of the box equals 30 2h, which can’t be negative, h can’t be greater than 15. Thus, sensible values for h are 0 15h . You now want to find the maximum value of V h in this interval. You use the method from the section, “Finding Absolute Extrema on a Closed Interval,” in Chapter 11. 3. Find the critical numbers of V h in the open interval 015, by setting its derivative equal to zero and solving. And don’t forget to check for numbers where the derivative is undefined. FIGURE 12-1:  The box is made from a 30”-by-30” piece of cardboard by cutting off the corners and folding up the sides. CHAPTER 12 Your Problems Are Solved: Differentiation to the Rescue! 323 Vh hh h V hh h h 4 120 900 12 240 900 0122 32 2 2 ()power rule 440 900 02075 15 5 2 h hh hh h (dividing both sides by 12) (ordinary trinomial factoring) or h 15 5 Because 15 is not in the open interval 015, , it doesn’t qualify as a critical number (though this is a moot point because you end up testing it in Step 4 anyway). And because this derivative is defined for all input values and is, thus, never undefined, there are no additional critical numbers. So, 5 is the only critical number. 4. Evaluate the function at the critical number, 5, and at the endpoints of the interval, 0 and 15, to locate the function’s max. V hh hh V V V 4 120 900 00 52 000 15 0 32 , Test the endpoints. The extremum (dig that fancy word for maximum or minimum) you’re look- ing for doesn’t often occur at an endpoint, but it can — so don’t fail to evaluate the function at the interval’s two endpoints. So, a height of 5 inches produces the box with maximum volume (2000 cubic inches). Because the length and width equal 30 2h, a height of 5 gives a length and width of 30 25, or 20, and thus the dimensions of the desired box are 52020. That’s it. The maximum area of a corral — yeehaw! A rancher can afford 300 feet of fencing to build a corral that’s divided into two equal rect- angles. See Figure 12-2. What dimensions will maximize the corral’s area? This is another practical problem. The rancher wants to give his animals as much room as possible given the length of fencing he can afford. Like all businesspeople, he wants the most bang for his buck. FIGURE 12-2: Calculus for cowboys — maximizing a corral. 324 UNIT 4 Differentiation 1. a. Express the thing you want maximized (area) as a function of the two unknowns (x and y). Al w xy2 In the above cardboard box example, you can easily write the volume as a function of one variable — which is always what you need. But here, the area is a function of two variables (x and y), so Step 1 has the following two extra sub-steps that will eliminate one of the variables. 1. b. Use the given information to relate the two variables to each other. The 300 feet of fencing is used for seven sections, thus 300 300 43 xxxx yyy xy 1. c. Solve this equation for y and plug the result in for y in the equation from Step 1a. This gives you what you need — a function of one variable. 4 3 300 3 300 4 300 4 3 100 4 3 xy yx y x yx Now do the substitu( ttion.) Ax y Ax xx Ax xx 2 2 100 4 3 200 8 3 2 2. Determine the domain of the function. You can’t have a negative length of fence, so x can’t be negative, and the most x can be is 300 divided by 4, or 75. Thus, 0 75x . 3. Find the critical numbers of Ax in the open interval 075, by setting its derivative equal to zero and solving (and check whether the derivative is undefined anywhere in the interval). Ax xx Ax x x 200 8 3 200 16 3 0 200 16 3 16 2 (power rule) 33 200 37 5 x . Because A is defined for all x-values, 37.5 is the only critical number. CHAPTER 12 Your Problems Are Solved: Differentiation to the Rescue! 325 4. Evaluate the function at the critical number, 37.5, and at the endpoints of the interval, 0 and 75. Ax xx A A A 200 8 3 00 37 5 3750 75 0 2 . Note: Evaluating a function at the endpoints of a closed interval is a standard step in finding an absolute extremum on the interval. However, you could have skipped this step here had you noticed that Ax is an upside-down parabola and that, therefore, its peak at 37 5 3750., must be higher than either endpoint. The maximum value in the interval is 3750, and thus, an x-value of 37.5 feet maximizes the corral’s area. The length is 2x, or 75 feet. The width is y, which equals 100 4 3 x. Plugging in 37.5 gives you 100 4 3 37 5. , or 50 feet. So, the rancher will build a 75’-by-50’ corral with an area of 3750 square feet. 1 What are the dimensions of the soup can of greatest volume that can be made with 50 square inches of tin? (The entire can, including the top and bottom, is made of tin.) And what’s its volume? 2 A Norman window is in the shape of a semicircle above a rectangle. If the straight edges of the frame cost $20 per linear foot and the circular frame costs $25 per linear foot, and you want a window with an area of 20 square feet, what dimensions will minimize the cost of the frame? 326 UNIT 4 Differentiation 3 A right triangle is placed in the first quadrant with its legs on the x- and y-axes. Given that its hypotenuse must pass through the point 25, , what are the dimensions and area of the smallest such triangle? 4 You’re designing an open-top cardboard box for a purveyor of nuts. The top will be made of clear plastic, but the plastic-box-top designer is handling that. The box must have a square base and two cardboard pieces that divide the box into four sections for the almonds, cashews, pecans, and walnuts. See the following figure. Given that you want a box with a volume of 72 cubic inches, what dimensions will minimize the total cardboard area and thus minimize the cost of the cardboard? What’s the total area of cardboard? Yo-Yo a Go-Go: Position, Velocity, and Acceleration Every time you get in your car, you witness differentiation. Your speed is the first derivative of your position. And when you step on the accelerator or the brake  — accelerating or decelerating — you experience a second derivative. CHAPTER 12 Your Problems Are Solved: Differentiation to the Rescue! 327 The derivative of position is velocity, and the derivative of velocity is acceleration. If a function gives the position of something as a function of time, you differentiate the position function to get the velocity function, and you differentiate the velocity function to get the acceleration function. Stated a different but equivalent way, the first derivative of position is velocity, and the second derivative of position is acceleration. Here’s a problem. A yo-yo moves straight up and down. Its height above the ground, as a function of time, is given by the function Ht tt t 3265 30, where t is in seconds and Ht is in inches. At t 0, it’s 30 inches above the ground, and after 4 seconds, it’s at a height of 18 inches. See Figure 12-3. Velocity, V t , is the derivative of position (height, in this problem), and acceleration, At , is the derivative of velocity. Thus: Ht tt t V tH tt At V t 32 2 65 30 3125 (power rule) tttHt612(power rule) Take a look at the graphs of these three functions in Figure 12-4. Using the three functions and their graphs, I want to discuss several things about the yo-yo’s motion: » Maximum and minimum height » Maximum, minimum, and average velocity » Total displacement » Maximum, minimum, and average speed » Total distance traveled » Positive and negative acceleration » Speeding up and slowing down FIGURE 12-3: The yo-yo’s height, from 0 to 4 seconds. 328 UNIT 4 Differentiation Because this is a lot to cover, I’ll cut some corners — like not always checking endpoints when looking for extrema if it’s obvious that they don’t occur at the endpoints. Do you mind? I didn’t think so. (Position, velocity, and acceleration problems make use of several ideas from Chapter 11 — local extrema, concavity, inflection points — so you may want to take a look back at those definitions if you’re a little hazy.) But before tackling the bulleted topics, let’s go over a few things about velocity, speed, and, acceleration. Velocity, speed, and acceleration None of your friends will complain  — or even notice  — if you use the words “velocity” and “speed” interchangeably, but your friendly mathematician will complain. Here’s the difference. FIGURE 12-4: The graphs of the yo-yo’s height, velocity, and acceleration functions from 0 to 4 seconds. CHAPTER 12 Your Problems Are Solved: Differentiation to the Rescue! 329 For the velocity function in Figure  12-4, upward motion by the yo-yo is defined as a positive velocity, and downward motion is a negative velocity. This is the standard way velocity is treated in most calculus and physics problems. (Or, if the motion is horizontal, going right is a positive velocity and going left is a negative velocity.) Speed, on the other hand, is always positive (or zero). If a car goes by at 50 mph, for instance, you say its speed is 50, and you mean positive 50, regardless of whether it’s going to the right or the left. For velocity, the direction matters; for speed, it does not. In everyday life, speed is a simpler idea than velocity because it’s always positive and because it agrees with our com- monsense notion about how fast something is moving. But in calculus, speed is actually the trickier idea because it doesn’t fit nicely into the three-function scheme shown in Figure 12-4. You’ve got to keep the velocity-speed distinction in mind when analyzing velocity and accel- eration. The way we talk about velocity, speed, and acceleration — in calculus class, as opposed to in everyday life — can get pretty weird. For example, if an object is going down (or to the left) faster and faster, its speed is increasing, but its velocity is decreasing because its velocity is becoming a bigger and bigger negative (and bigger negatives are smaller numbers). This seems weird, but that’s the way it works. And here’s another strange thing: Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity, not speed. So, if an object is slowing down while going in the downward direction and thus has an increasing velocity  — because the velocity is becoming a smaller and smaller negative — the object has a positive acceleration. In everyday English, you’d say that the object is decelerating (slowing down), but in calculus class, though you could still say the object is slowing down, you’d say that the object has a negative velocity and a posi- tive acceleration. (By the way, deceleration isn’t exactly a technical term, so you should probably avoid it in calculus class. It’s best to use the following vocabulary: positive acceleration, negative acceleration, positive velocity, negative velocity, speeding up, and slowing down.) I could go on with this stuff, but I bet you’ve had enough. Maximum and minimum height The maximum and minimum height of the yo-yo, in other words, the max and min of Ht , occur at the local extrema you can see in Figure 12-4. To locate them, set the derivative of Ht (that’s V t ) equal to zero and solve: HV tt t tt t t 3125 03 12 5 12 12 43 5 23 2 2 2 (qquadratic formula) or 12 84 6 12 221 6 621 3 0473 53.. 330 UNIT 4 Differentiation These two numbers are the zeros of Ht (which is V t ) and the t-coordinates, that’s time- coordinates, of the max and min of Ht , which you can see in Figure 12-4. In other words, these are the times when the yo-yo reaches its maximum and minimum heights. Plug these numbers into Ht to obtain the heights: H H 047311 353169 .. .. So, the yo-yo gets as high as about 31.1 inches above the ground at t 047. seconds and as low as about 16.9 inches at t 353. seconds. (By the way, do you see why the max and min of the yo-yo’s height would occur when the yo-yo’s velocity is zero?) Velocity and displacement As I explain in the section “Velocity, speed, and acceleration,” velocity is basically like speed, except that while speed is always positive (or zero), velocity can be positive (when going up or to the right) or negative (when going down or to the left). The connection between displacement and distance traveled is similar: Distance traveled is always positive (or zero), but going down (or left) counts as negative displacement. In everyday speech, speed and distance traveled are the more user-friendly ideas, but when it comes to calculus and physics, velocity and displace- ment are the more fundamental ideas. Total displacement Let’s get back to my yo-yo analysis. Total displacement is defined as final position minus ini- tial position. Total displacement final positioninitial position So, because the yo-yo starts at a height of 30 and ends at a height of 18, Total displacement 18 30 12 inches This is negative because the net movement is downward. Average velocity Average velocity is given by total displacement divided by elapsed time: Average velocity total elapsed time displacement I just calculated the total displacement ( 12 inches), and time runs from 0 seconds to 4 seconds, so the elapsed time is 4 seconds. Thus, Average velocity 12 4 3 inches seconds inches per second This answer of negative 3 tells you that the yo-yo is, on average, going down 3 inches per second. CHAPTER 12 Your Problems Are Solved: Differentiation to the Rescue! 331 Maximum and minimum velocity To determine the yo-yo’s maximum and minimum velocity during the interval from 0 to 4 seconds, set the derivative of V t  — that’s At  — equal to zero and solve: V At tt 612 6 12 0 2 t t (Look again at Figure  12-4. At t 2, you get the zero of At , the local min of V t , and the inflection point of Ht . But you already knew that, right? If not, check out Chapter 11.) Now, evaluate V t at the critical number, 2, and at the interval’s endpoints, 0 and 4: Vt tt V V V 3125 05 27 45 2 So, the yo-yo has a maximum velocity of 5 inches per second twice — at both the beginning and the end of the interval. It reaches a minimum velocity of 7 inches per second at t 2 seconds. Speed and distance traveled As mentioned in the previous section, velocity and displacement are the more technical concepts, while speed and distance traveled are the more commonsense ideas. Speed, of course, is the thing you read on your speedometer, and you can read distance traveled on your odometer or your “tripometer” after setting it to zero. Total distance traveled To determine total distance, add up the distances traveled on each leg of the yo-yo’s trip: the up leg, the down leg, and the second up leg. First, the yo-yo goes up from a height of 30 inches to about 31.1 inches (where the first turn- around point is). That’s a distance of about 1.1 inches. Next, it goes down from about 31.1 to about 16.9 (the height of the second turn-around point). That’s a distance of 31.1 minus 16.9, or about 14.2 inches. Finally, the yo-yo goes up again from about 16.9 inches to its final height of 18 inches. That’s another 1.1 inches. Add these three distances to obtain the total distance traveled: 11 14 21 1164.. .. inches. (Note: Compare this answer to the total displacement of 12. The displacement is negative because the net movement is downward. And the positive amount of the displacement, namely 12, is less than the distance traveled of 16.4 because with displacement, the up legs of the yo-yo’s trip cancel out part of the down leg distance. Check out the math: 11 14 21 112.. . . Get it?) In a nutshell, the total distance traveled is how far you go along the path you’re on — like the way your car’s odometer works or, if you’re walking, 332 UNIT 4 Differentiation a pedometer. Total displacement, on the other hand, is a net distance, or you could say the crow-fly distance from start to finish (remembering, though, that this can be a negative num- ber for going down or to the left). Average speed The yo-yo’s average speed is given by the total distance traveled divided by the elapsed time. Averagespeed total elapsed time distance Thus, Averagespeed 16 4 4 41 . .inches per second Maximum and minimum speed You previously determined the yo-yo’s maximum velocity (5 inches per second) and its mini- mum velocity ( 7 inches per second). A velocity of 7 is a speed of 7, so that’s the yo-yo’s maxi- mum speed. Its minimum speed of zero occurs at the two turnaround points. When you switch directions, your velocity is zero (for an infinitesimal moment). A good way to analyze maximum and minimum speed is to consider the speed function and its graph. (Or, if you’re a glutton for punishment, check out the following mumbo jumbo.) Speed equals the absolute value of velocity. So, for the yo-yo problem, the speed function, St , equals Vt tt3125 2 . Check out the graph of St in Figure 12-5. Looking at this graph, it’s easy to see that the yo-yo’s maximum speed occurs at t 2 (the maximum speed is S 23 2122 57 2 ), and that the minimum speed is zero at the two x-intercepts. Minimum and maximum speed. For a continuous velocity function, the minimum speed is zero whenever the maximum and minimum velocities are of opposite signs or when one of them is zero. When the maximum and minimum velocities are both positive or both negative, the minimum speed is the lesser of the absolute values of the maximum and minimum velocities. In all cases, the maximum speed is the greater of the absolute values of the maximum and mini- mum velocities. Is that a mouthful or what? FIGURE 12-5: The yo-yo’s speed function, St Vt . CHAPTER 12 Your Problems Are Solved: Differentiation to the Rescue! 333 Burning some rubber with acceleration Let’s go over acceleration: Put your pedal to the metal. Positive and negative acceleration The graph of the acceleration function at the bottom of Figure 12-4 is a simple line, At t612. It’s easy to see that the acceleration of the yo-yo goes from a minimum of 12 inches per second second at t 0 seconds to a maximum of 12 inches per second second at t 4 seconds, and that the acceleration is zero at t 2 when the yo-yo reaches its minimum velocity (and maximum speed). When the acceleration is negative — on the interval 02,  — the velocity is decreasing. When the accelera- tion is positive — on the interval 24,  — the velocity is increasing. Speeding up and slowing down Figuring out when the yo-yo is speeding up and slowing down is probably more interesting and descriptive of its motion than the info in the preceding section. An object is speeding up (what we call “acceleration” in everyday speech) whenever the velocity and the calculus acceleration are both positive or both negative. And an object is slowing down (“deceleration” in everyday speech) when the velocity and the calculus acceleration are of opposite signs. Look at all three graphs in Figure 12-4 again. From t 0 to about t 047. , the velocity is posi- tive and the acceleration is negative, so the yo-yo is slowing down while moving upward (till its velocity becomes zero and it reaches its maximum height). In plain English, the yo-yo is decelerating from 0 to about 0.47 seconds. The greatest deceleration occurs at t 0, when the deceleration is 12 inches per second second (the graph shows negative 12, but I’m calling it positive 12 because I’m calling it a deceleration, get it?). From about t 047. to t 2, both velocity and acceleration are negative, so the yo-yo is speed- ing up while moving downward. From t 2 to about t 353. , velocity is negative and accelera- tion is positive, so the yo-yo is slowing down again as it continues downward (till it bottoms out at its lowest height). Finally, from about t 353. to t 4, both velocity and acceleration are positive, so the yo-yo is speeding up again. The yo-yo reaches its greatest acceleration of 12 inches per second second at t 4 seconds. Tying it all together Note the following connections among the three graphs in Figure 12-4. The negative section on the graph of At  — from t 0 to t 2 — corresponds to a decreasing section of the graph of V t and a concave down section of the graph of Ht . The positive interval on the graph of At  — from t 2 to t 4 — corresponds to an increasing interval on the graph of V t and a concave up interval on the graph of Ht . When t 2 seconds, At has a zero, V t has a local minimum, and Ht has an inflection point. 334 UNIT 4 Differentiation For Problems 5, 6, and 7, a duck-billed platypus is swimming back and forth along the side of your boat, blithely unaware that he’s the subject for calculus problems in rectilinear motion. The back of your boat is at the zero position, and the front of your boat is in the positive direction (see the following figure). Note that st gives the platypus’s position (in feet) as a function of time (seconds). Find his a) position, b) velocity, c) speed, and d) acceleration, at t 2 seconds. WHAT THE HECK IS A SECOND SQUARED? Note that I use the unit inches per second second for acceleration instead of the equivalent but weird-looking unit, inches second2 . You often see acceleration given in terms of a unit of distance over second2, or you might see something like inches per second2. But what the heck is a second2? It’s meaningless, and something like inches/second2 is a bad way to think about acceleration. The best way to understand acceleration is as a change in speed per unit of time. If a car can go from 0 to 60 mph in 6 seconds, that’s an increase in speed of 60 mph in 6 seconds, or, on average, 10 mph each second — that’s an acceleration of 10 mph second. It’s slightly more confusing when the speed has a unit like feet/second and the unit of time for the acceleration is also a second, because then the word second appears twice. But it still works like the car example. Say an object starts at rest and speeds up to 10 feet/second after 1 second, then up to 20 feet/second after 2 seconds, to 30 feet/second after 3 seconds, and so on. Its speed is increasing 10 feet/second each second, and that’s an acceleration of 10 feet per second second or 10 feet/second second . (By the way, it’s helpful to write the acceleration unit in either of these ways (using a vertical fraction) as a speed over the unit of time — instead of horizontally like 10 feet per second per second or 10 feet/second/second — to emphasize that acceleration is a change in speed per unit of time.) Think of acceleration this way, not in terms of that weird second2 thing. 5 st t54 2 CHAPTER 12 Your Problems Are Solved: Differentiation to the Rescue! 335 6 st tt t35 6 43 7 st t t 18 3 3 For Problems 8, 9, and 10, a three-toed sloth is hanging onto a tree branch and moving right and left along the branch. (The tree trunk is at zero and the positive direction goes out from the trunk.) Note that st gives its position (in feet) as a function of time (seconds). Between t 0 and t 5, for each problem, find a) the intervals when the sloth is moving away from the trunk, the intervals when it is moving toward the trunk, and when and where it turns around; b) its total distance moved and its average speed; and c) its total displacement and average velocity. 8 st tt t28 5 32 336 UNIT 4 Differentiation 9 st tt t 42 10 st t t 1 4 2 Related Rates — They Rate, Relatively Say you’re filling up your swimming pool and you know how fast water is coming out of your hose, and you want to calculate how fast the water level in the pool is rising. You know one rate (how fast the water is being poured in), and you want to determine another rate (how fast the water level is rising). These rates are called related rates because one depends on the other — the rate that the water level is rising will depend on the rate that the water is being poured in. In a related rates problem, you’re given one or more rates that are either constant or changing, and you have to figure out a related rate that is usually changing. You have to determine this related rate at one particular point in time. (If this isn’t crystal clear, you’ll see what I mean in a minute when you work through the following problems.) Related rates problems are the Waterloo for many a calculus student. But they’re not that bad after you get the basic technique down. The best way to get the hang of them is by working through lots of examples, so let’s get started. Blowing up a balloon You’re blowing up a balloon at a rate of 300 cubic inches per minute. When the balloon’s radius is 3 inches, how fast is the radius increasing? CHAPTER 12 Your Problems Are Solved: Differentiation to the Rescue! 337 1. Draw a diagram, labeling it with any unchanging measurements (there aren’t any in this unusually simple problem) and making sure to assign a variable to anything in the problem that’s changing (unless it’s irrelevant to the problem). See Figure 12-6. Notice that the radius in Figure 12-6 is labeled with the variable r. The radius needs a variable because as the balloon is being blown up, the radius is changing. I put the 3 in parentheses to emphasize that the number 3 is not an unchanging measurement. The problem asks you to determine something when the radius is 3 inches, but remember, the radius is constantly changing. Changing or unchanging? In related rates problems, it’s important to distinguish between what is changing and what is not changing. The volume of the balloon is also changing, so you need a variable for volume, V. You could put a V on your diagram to indicate the changing volume, but there’s really no easy way to mark part of the balloon with a V like you can show the radius with an r. 2. List the given rate and the rate you’re asked to determine as derivatives with respect to time. You’re pumping up the balloon at 300 cubic inches per minute. That’s a rate — a change in volume (cubic inches) per change in time (minutes). So, dV dt 300 cubic inches per minute You have to figure out a related rate, namely, how fast the radius is changing, so dr dt ? 3. Write down the formula that connects the variables in the problem, V and r. Here’s the formula for the volume of a sphere: V r 4 3 3 FIGURE 12-6: Blowing up a balloon — time to party! 338 UNIT 4 Differentiation 4. Differentiate your formula with respect to time, t. When you differentiate in a related rates problem, all variables are treated like the y’s are treated in a typical implicit differentiation problem. dV dt r dr dt r dr dt 4 3 3 4 2 2 · You need to add the dr dt just like you would add on a y or a dy dx with implicit differentiation. 5. Substitute known values for the rate and variables in the equation from Step 4, and then solve for the thing you’re asked to determine. It’s given that dV dt 300, and you’re asked to figure out dr dt when r 3, so plug in these numbers and solve for dr dt . Differentiate before you plug in. Be sure to differentiate (Step 4) before you plug the given information into the unknowns (Step 5). dV dt r dr dt dr dt dr dt dr dt dr dt 4 300 43 300 36 300 36 25 3 2 2· 2265.inches per minute So, the radius is increasing at a rate of about 2.65 inches per minute when the radius measures 3 inches. Think of all the balloons you’ve blown up since your childhood. Now you finally have the answer to the question that’s been bugging you all these years. By the way, if you plug 5 into r instead of 3, you get an answer of about 0.95 inches per minute. This should agree with your balloon-blowing-up experience: The bigger the balloon gets, the slower it grows. It’s a good idea to check things like this every so often to see that the math agrees with common sense. After finishing a math problem, ask yourself whether your answer makes sense. Asking this question can help you increase your success in math (and science). I’m not referring here to the things you can do to confirm an answer — things like plugging an answer into a variable, or solving backwards — confirming your answers like that is another great strategy for success. What I’m talking about here is asking yourself whether your answer to a problem is within the ballpark of what’s reasonable (as opposed to something that’s ridiculous or impossible). And while it’s not always possible to decide whether a math answer is reasonable, you should always keep this important question in mind. CHAPTER 12 Your Problems Are Solved: Differentiation to the Rescue! 339 Filling up a trough Here’s another related rates problem. A trough is being filled up with swill. The trough is 10 feet long, and its cross-section is an isosceles triangle with a base of 2 feet and a height of 2 feet 6 inches (with the vertex at the bottom, of course). Swill’s being poured in at a rate of 5 cubic feet per minute. When the depth of the swill is 1 foot 3 inches, how fast is the swill level rising? 1. Draw a diagram, labeling it with any unchanging measurements and assigning variables to any changing things. See Figure 12-7. Note that Figure 12-7 shows the unchanging dimensions of the trough (2 feet, 2 feet 6 inches, and 10 feet), and that these dimensions do not have variable names like l for length or h for height. And note that the changing things — the height (or depth) of the swill and the width of the surface of the swill (which gets wider as the swill gets deeper) — have variable names, h for height and b for base (I say base instead of width because it’s the base of the upside-down triangle shape made by the swill). The volume of the swill is also changing, so you can call that V. 2. List the given rate and the rate you’re asked to figure out as derivatives with respect to time. dV dt dh dt 5cubic feet per minute ? 3. a. Write down the formula that connects the variables in the problem: V, h, and b. I’m absolutely positive that you remember the formula for the volume of a right prism (the shape of the swill in the trough): V area of base height Note that this “base” is the base of the prism (the whole triangle at the end of the trough), not the base of the triangle that is labeled b in Figure 12-7. Also, this “height” is the height of the prism (the length of the trough), not the height labeled h in Figure 12-7. Sorry about the confusion. Deal with it. FIGURE 12-7: Filling a trough with swill — lunch time. 340 UNIT 4 Differentiation The area of the triangular base equals 1 2 bh, and the “height” of the prism is 10 feet, so the formula becomes V bh V bh 1 2 10 5 · Now, unlike the formula in the balloon example, this formula contains a variable, b, that you don’t see in your list of derivatives in Step 2. So, Step 3 has a second part — getting rid of this extra variable. 3. b. Find an equation that relates the unwanted variable, b, to some other variable in the problem so you can make a substitution that leaves you with only V and h. The triangular face of the swill in the trough is similar to the triangular face of the trough itself, so the base and height of these triangles are proportional. (Recall from geometry that similar triangles are triangles of the same shape; their sides are propor- tional.) Thus, bh not b h bh 22 5 26 2 25 08 . . . . (Be careful: 2 6isfeet.) Be on the lookout for similar triangles. Similar triangles come up a lot in related rates problems. Look for them whenever the problem involves a triangle, a triangular prism, or a cone shape. Now substitute 0.8h for b in your formula from Step 3a. V bh V hh V h 5 50 8 4 2 . 4. Differentiate this equation with respect to t. dV dt h dh dt 8 the power rule with the implicit differentia( ttion dh dt ) 5. Substitute known values for the rate and variable in the equation from Step 4 and then solve. You know that dV dt 5 cubic feet per minute, and you want to determine dh dt when h equals 1 foot 3 inches, or 1.25 feet, so plug in 5 and 1.25 and solve for dh dt : dV dt h dh dt dh dt dh dt 8 58 125 1 2 ·. · That’s it. The swill’s level is rising at a rate of 1 2 foot per minute when the swill is 1 foot 3 inches deep. Dig in. CHAPTER 12 Your Problems Are Solved: Differentiation to the Rescue! 341 Fasten your seat belt: You’re approaching a calculus crossroads Ready for another common related rates problem? One car leaves an intersection traveling north at 50 mph, and another is driving west toward the intersection at 40 mph. At one point, the north-bound car is three-tenths of a mile north of the intersection, and the west-bound car is four-tenths of a mile east of it. At this point, how fast is the distance between the cars changing? 1. Do the diagram thing. See Figure 12-8. Variable or fixed? Before going on with this problem, I want to mention the problem you’ll do next. It involves a ladder leaning against and sliding down a wall. Check out the figure that goes with the next problem, but note that when you draw your own diagram for a ladder-against-a-wall problem like this, you won’t draw a house like I did. Your diagram would be very similar to Figure 12-8, except that the y-axis would represent the wall, the x-axis would be the ground, and the diagonal line would be the ladder. The ladder problem and the car problem are quite similar, but there’s an important difference. The distance between the cars is changing, so the diagonal line in Figure 12-8 is labeled with a variable, s. A ladder, on the other hand, has a fixed length, so the diagonal line in your diagram for a ladder problem would be labeled with a number, not a variable. 2. List all given rates and the unknown rate. As Car A travels north, the distance y is growing at 50 miles per hour. That’s a rate, a change in distance per change in time. So, changeindistanceiny direction changeintime dy dt 50 mph FIGURE 12-8: Calculus — it’s a drive in the country. 342 UNIT 4 Differentiation As Car B travels west, the distance x is shrinking at 40 miles per hour. That’s a negative rate: changeindistanceinx direction changeintime dx dt 40 mph You have to figure out how fast s is changing, so, changeindistanceins direction changeintime ds dt ? 3. Write the formula that relates the variables in the problem: x, y, and s. The Pythagorean Theorem, a bc 222, will do the trick for this right triangle problem. In this problem, x and y are the legs of the right triangle, and s is the hypotenuse, so xy s 22 2. The Pythagorean Theorem is used a lot in related rates problems. If there’s a right triangle in your problem, it’s quite likely that a bc 222 is the formula you’ll need. Because this formula contains the variables x, y, and s, which all appear in your list of derivatives in Step 2, you don’t have to tweak this formula like you did in the trough problem. 4. Differentiate with respect to t. sx y s ds dt x dx dt y dy dt 22 2 2 22 (implicit differentiation withh the power rule) (Remember, in a related rates problem, all variables are treated like the y’s in an implicit differentiation problem.) 5.

CHAPTER 12 Your Problems Are Solved: Differentiation to the Rescue! 343 Now plug everything into your equation: 22 2 2 05 20 4402 03 50 1 s ds dt x dx dt y dy dt ds dt ds dt ·. ·· .· ·. · · 32 30 2 ds dt This negative answer means that the distance, s, is decreasing. Thus, when Car A is 3 blocks north of the intersection and Car B is 4 blocks east of it, the dis- tance between them is decreasing at a rate of 2 mph. Try this at your own risk One final related rates problem. A homeowner decides to paint his home. He picks up a home improvement book, which recommends that a ladder should be placed against a wall such that the distance from the foot of the ladder to the bottom of the wall is one-third the length of the ladder. Not being the sharpest tool in the shed, the homeowner gets mixed up and thinks that it’s the distance from the top of the ladder to the base of the wall that should be a third of the ladder’s length. He sets up his 18-foot ladder accordingly, and — despite this unstable ladder placement — he manages to climb the ladder and start painting. (Perhaps the foot of the lad- der is caught on a tree root or something.) His luck doesn’t last long, and the ladder begins to slide rapidly down the wall. One foot before the top of the ladder hits the ground, it’s falling at a rate of 20 feet/second. At this moment, how fast is the foot of the ladder moving away from the wall? 1. Draw a diagram, labeling it with any unchanging measurements and assigning variables to any changing things. See the following figure. You don’t have to draw the house — the basic triangle is enough. But I’ve sketched a fuller picture of this scenario to make clear what a knucklehead this guy is. 344 UNIT 4 Differentiation 2. List all given rates and the rate you’re asked to figure out. Write these rates as deriva- tives with respect to time. Note that h is the distance from the top of the ladder to the bottom of the wall; b is the distance from the base of the ladder to the wall. You’re told that the ladder is falling at a rate of 20 feet/second. Going down is negative, so dh dt h db dt 20 1 (when ) ? 3. Write down the formula that connects the variables in the problem, h and b. That’s the Pythagorean Theorem, of course: a bc 222, thus h b 22 218 . 4. Differentiate with respect to time. hb h dh dt b db dt 22 218 2 20 5. Substitute known values for the rates and variables in the equation from Step 4, and then solve for the thing you’re asked to determine. You’re trying to determine db dt , so you have to plug numbers into everything else. But, as often happens, you don’t have a number for b, so you need to use a formula to get the number you need. This will often be the same formula you already used. h b b b 22 2 22 2 18 118 323 17 97.feet (Obviously, you can reject the negative answer.)

(This optional step is always a good idea when feasible.) Yes, it does make sense. It makes sense that the bottom of the ladder is moving out much more slowly than the top of the ladder is moving down. Hold a yardstick against a wall so the bottom of it is on the floor and the top of it is on the wall about 4 or 5 inches from the floor. Then push the top of the yardstick 4 or 5 inches down to the floor. You’ll see that the bottom barely moves farther out from the wall. Right triangles with a fixed hypotenuse always work like that. If one leg is much shorter than the other, the short leg can change a lot while the long leg barely changes. It’s a byproduct of the Pythagorean Theorem. CHAPTER 12 Your Problems Are Solved: Differentiation to the Rescue! 345 11 This problem involves the same trough as the one in the example problem (it’s 10 feet long and its cross section is an isosceles triangle with a base of 2 feet and a height of 2 feet 6 inches). But this time, the farmer is pouring swill into the trough at a rate of 1 cubic foot per minute, and just as the swill reaches the brim, three hogs start violently sucking down the swill at a rate of 1 2 cubic foot per minute for each hog. They’re going at it so vigorously that another 1 2 cubic foot of swill is being splashed out of the trough each minute. The farmer keeps pouring in swill, but she’s no match for her hogs. When the depth of the swill falls to 1 foot 8 inches, how fast is the swill level falling? 12 A pitcher delivers a fastball, which the batter pops up — it goes straight up above home plate. When it reaches a height of 60 feet, it’s moving up at a rate of 50 feet per second. At this point, how fast is the distance from the ball to second base growing? Note: The distance between the bases of a baseball diamond is 90 feet (home to first, first to sec- ond, and so on). 13 A 6-foot-tall man looking over his shoulder sees his shadow that’s cast by a 15-foot- tall lamppost in front of him. The shadow frightens him, so he starts running away from it — toward the lamppost. Unfortunately, this only makes matters worse, as it causes the frightening head of the shadow to gain on him. He starts to panic and run even faster. Five feet before he crashes into the lamppost, he’s running at a speed of 15 miles per hour. At this point, how fast is the tip of the shadow moving? 14 Salt is being unloaded onto a conical pile at a rate of 200 cubic feet per minute. If the height of the cone-shaped pile is always equal to the radius of the cone’s base, how fast is the height of the pile increasing when it’s 18 feet tall? 346 UNIT 4 Differentiation Practice Questions Answers and Explanations 1 The dimensions are 3.25 inches wide and 3.25 inches tall.

Geometric optimization problems frequently have results where the dimensions have some nice, simple mathematical relationship to each other. By the way, did you notice that I skipped evaluating the volume at the endpoints of the domain? Can you guess why I did that? Hint: What’s the volume for the smallest and largest value of the radius? 2 The dimensions of the window need to be about 4 3 wide and about 5 1 high. The minimum cost is roughly $373. 1.

Cx xx x Cundefined C C 15 40 400 0 2 143 373 357 423 .$ .$ You know C 2 143 373.$ is a min (not a max) because the cost goes up to $423 as x increases from 2.143, and as x decreases to zero, the cost also goes up (imagine plugging some tiny number like x = 0.001 into C x ; you would get an enormous cost). So, the least expensive frame for a 20-square-foot window will cost about $373 and will be 2 2 143. , or about 4.286 feet or 4 3 wide at the base. Because y x x10 4 , the height of the rectangular lower part of the window will be 2.98, or about 3 tall. The total height will thus be 2.98 plus 2.14, or about 511 . 3 The hypotenuse meets the y-axis at 010, and the x-axis at 40, ; the triangle’s area is 20. 1. Draw a diagram (see the following figure). 2. a. Write a formula for the thing you want to minimize, the area: Abh 1 2 2. b. Use the given constraints to relate b and h. This is a bit tricky — Hint: Consider similar triangles. If you draw a horizontal line from 05, to 25, , you create a little triangle in the upper-left corner that’s similar to the whole triangle. (You can prove their similarity with AA — remember your geometry? — as both triangles have a right angle and both share the top angle.) 350 UNIT 4 Differentiation Because the triangles are similar, their sides are proportional: height base height bas bigtriangle bigtriangle smalltriangle ee h b h smalltriangle 5 2 2. c. Solve for one variable in terms of the other — take your pick — and substitute into your formula to create a function of a single variable.

(b) v ts tt10 , so at t 2, the platypus’s velocity is s 220 feet/second (20 is positive so that’s toward the front of the boat). (c) Speed is the absolute value of velocity, so the speed is also 20 feet/second. (d) Acceleration, a t , equals v ts t 10. That’s a constant, so the platypus’s accelera- tion is 10 feet second second at all times. 6 (a) s 2 gives the platypus’s position at t 2; that’s 32 52 26 43 , or 4 feet, from the back of the boat.

CHAPTER 12 Your Problems Are Solved: Differentiation to the Rescue! 353 (a) At t 2, st equals 1 2 13, or 15. feet. This means that the platypus is 1 5. feet behind the back of the boat.

Give yourself a pat on the back if you figured out that this positive acceleration with a negative velocity means the platypus is actually slowing down. 8 7 (a) The sloth never turns around; it moves away from the trunk for the entire interval from 0 to 5 seconds. Find the zeros of the velocity: v ts tt t tt 62 8 62 8 2 2 0 0 No solutions. 34 2tt A quadratic has no solutions when the discriminant (bac 2 4 ) is negative. The fact that the velocity is never zero means that the sloth never turns around. At t 0, v t 8 feet second which is positive, so the sloth moves away from the trunk for the entire interval. (b and c) Both total distance and total displacement are 265 feet; both average speed and average velocity are 53 feet/second. Displacement ss50 260 5 265 Because there are no turnaround points and because the motion is in the positive direc- tion, the total distance and total displacement are the same: 265 feet. Average velocity totaldisplacement totaltime ss 50 50 265 5 53 feet second Whenever the total distance equals the total displacement, average speed also equals average velocity: 53 feet/second. 354 UNIT 4 Differentiation 9 (a) The sloth is going left from 0 seconds to 0.385 seconds, and right from 0.385 to 5 seconds. The sloth turns around at 0.385 seconds when it is at s 0 385 0 385 0 385 0 385 42.. .. , or 0 215. feet. That’s 0.215 feet to the left of the trunk. Find the zeros of v t : v ts tt t42 1 3 You’ll need your calculator for this: Graph y tt42 1 3 and locate the x-intercepts. There’s just one: x 0 385. . That’s the only zero of st vt . Don’t forget that a zero of a derivative can be a horizontal inflection as well as a local extremum. You get turnaround points only at the local extrema of the position function. Because v 01 (a leftward velocity) and v 15 (a rightward velocity), s 0 385. must be a turnaround point (and it’s also a local min on the position graph). Does the first derivative test ring a bell? Thus, the sloth is going left from 0 to 0.385 seconds and right from 0.385 to 5 seconds. The sloth turns around, obviously, at 0.385 seconds when it is at s 0 385 0 385 0 385 0 385 42.. .. , or –0.215 feet. (I presume you figured out that there must be another branch on the tree on the other side of the trunk to allow the sloth to go left to a negative position.) (b) The sloth moved a total distance of 645.43 feet at an average speed of 129.1 feet/second. There are two legs of the sloth’s trip. It goes left from t 0 till t 0 385. , then right from t 0 385. till t 5. Just add up the positive lengths of the two legs. length ss lengths leg leg feet 1 2 0 385 0 0 215 0 0 215 5 . . . s 0 385 55 50 215 645 215 42 . . .feet The total distance is thus 0 215 645 215.. , or 645.43 feet. That’s one big tree! The branch is longer than two football fields. The sloth’s average speed is 645 43 5./ , or about 129.1 feet/second. That’s one fast sloth! About 88 per hour! (c) The sloth’s total displacement is 645 feet and its average velocity is 129 feet/second. Total displacement is ss50 ; that’s 645 0 645 feet. Lastly, the sloth’s average velocity is simply total displacement divided by total time — that’s 645 5/ , or 129 feet per second. 10 (a) The sloth goes right from t 0 till t 1 236. seconds; then turns around at s 1 236. , or about 0.405 feet to the right of the trunk; and then goes left till t 5.

So, the only zero velocity occurs at t 1 236. seconds. Because v 00 25. feet per second and v 50 037. , the first derivative test tells you that s 1 236. must be a local max and therefore a turnaround point. The sloth thus goes right from 0 to 1.236 seconds; then turns around at s 1 236. , which is about 0.405 feet to the right of the trunk; and then it goes left till t 5. (b) The total distance moved equals 0.353 feet; the average speed is 0.071 feet per second. The sloth’s total distance is the sum of the lengths of the two legs: going right going left ss s 1 236 0 0 405 025 0 155 5 . .. . ss 1 236 0 198 . . Total distance is therefore about 0 155 0 198 0 353.. . feet. The sloth’s average speed is thus about 0.353∕5, or 0.071 feet per second. That’s roughly 4.26 feet/minute — much more like it for a sloth. (c) The total displacement is about –0.043 feet; the average velocity is –0.0086 feet per second. Total displacement is defined as final position minus initial position, so that’s ss50 6 29 1 4 0 043.feet And thus the sloth’s average velocity is about −0.043/5, or −0.0086 feet per second. 11 It’s falling at a rate of 09. inches per minute. 1. Draw a diagram, labeling the diagram with any unchanging measurements and assigning variables to any changing things. 356 UNIT 4 Differentiation See the following figure. Note that the height of 1 foot 8 inches — which is the height only at one particular point in time — is in parentheses to distinguish it from the other unchanging dimensions. 2. List all given rates and the rate you’re asked to figure out. Express these rates as derivatives with respect to time. Give yourself a high-five if you realized that the thing that matters about the changing volume of swill is the net rate of change of volume. Swill is coming in at 1 cubic foot per minute. It’s going out at 3 1 2 cubic foot per minute (for the three hogs) plus another 1 2 cubic foot per minute (the splashing) — that’s a total of 2 cubic feet per minute going out. So, the net is 1 cubic foot per minute going out — that’s a negative rate of change. In calculus language, you write: dV dt 1cubic foot perminute. You’re asked to determine how fast the height is changing, so write: dh dt ? 3. Steps 3a and 3b here are the same as in the example trough problem. So, just like in that problem, you’ve got the following formula: V h4 2 4. Differentiate with respect to t. dV dt h dh dt 8 CHAPTER 12 Your Problems Are Solved: Differentiation to the Rescue! 357 5. Substitute all known quantities into this equation and solve for dh dt . You were given that h 18 (you must convert this to feet — that’s 5 3 feet), and you figured out in Step 2 that dV dt 1, so 18 5 3 1 40 3 3 40 9 10 dh dt dh dt feet minute inchesminute / / Thus, when the swill level drops to a depth of 1 foot 8 inches, it’s falling at a rate of 0.9 inches per minute. Mmm, mmm, good! 6. Ask whether this answer makes sense. It’s not easy to come up with a common-sense explanation of why this answer is or is not reasonable. But there’s another type of check that works here and in many other related rates problems. Take a very small increment of time — something much less than the time unit of the rates used in the problem. This problem involves rates per minute, so use 1 second for your time increment. Now ask yourself what happens in this problem in 1 second. The swill is leaving the trough at 1 cubic foot/minute; so, in 1 second, 1 60 cubic feet will leave the trough. What does that do to the swill height? Because of similar triangles, when the swill falls to a depth of 1 foot 8 inches, which is 2 3 of the height of the trough, the width of the surface of the swill must be 2 3 of the width of the trough — and that comes to 1 1 3 feet. So, the surface area of the swill is 1 1 3 10 feet. Assuming the trough walls are straight (this type of simplification always works in this type of checking process), the swill that leaves the trough will form the shape of a very, very short box (“box” sounds funny because this shape is so thin; maybe “thin piece of plywood” is a better image). The volume of a box equals lengthwidth height, thus 1 60 10 1 1 3 0 00125 height height . 358 UNIT 4 Differentiation This tells you that in 1 second, the height should fall 0.00125 feet or something very close to it. (This process sometimes produces an exact answer and sometimes an answer with a very small error.) Now, finally, see whether this number agrees with the answer. Your answer was –0.9 inches/minute. Convert this to feet/second: 9 10 12 60 0 00125. It checks. 12 The distance is growing at about 21.3 feet per second. 1. Draw your diagram and label it. See the following figure. 2.

If you’re ready to test your skills a bit more, take the following chapter quiz that incorporates all the chapter topics. 362 UNIT 4 Differentiation Whaddya Know? Chapter 12 Quiz For Problems 1 through 4, you’ve got a corral problem similar to the one in the section, “The maximum area of a corral  — yeehaw!” in this chapter. Your corral for Problems 1 through 4 is similar to the one in Figure 12-2, except that this time the rancher wants to have three equal rectangles side by side instead of two. And this time, the rancher wants to build a corral with 7200 square feet of area. He wants to construct the corral using as little fencing as pos- sible. (You should sketch a diagram similar to Figure  12-2 with 4 y’s instead of 3 and 6 x’s instead of 4.) 1 Express the thing you want to minimize or maximize as a function of x. 2 Find the derivative of your function, set it equal to zero, and solve. 3 What’s the domain of your function (mathematically, not practically, speaking), and what are its critical numbers? 4 What dimensions of the corral minimize the total length of fencing? And how much fencing is needed? For Problems 5, 6, and 7, you’ve got a particle moving right and/or left along an ordinary num- ber line. The function st tt t 3244 8 gives the particle’s position on the line (in meters) as a function of time (in seconds). 5 (a) What’s the velocity function, and what’s the acceleration function? (b) What is st , and explain what it means, what it tells you. 6 Does this particle ever reverse direction? If so, when? And, if so, does the particle switch from going left to going right or vice versa? 7 (a) What’s the particle’s total displacement from t 0 to t 4? (b) What’s the particle’s total distance traveled from t 0 to t 4? For Problems 8 through 10, you’ve got a right triangle with legs of lengths x and y. The x leg is growing at a rate of 3 inches/minute and the y leg is shrinking at a rate of 5 inches/minute. 8 Express the two given rates with calculus notation. 9 At a certain point in time, the area of the triangle is 50 square inches and the two legs are equal. At this point, how fast is the area changing? 10 One minute later, how fast is the area changing? CHAPTER 12 Your Problems Are Solved: Differentiation to the Rescue! 363 Answers to Chapter 12 Quiz 1 Lx x x 6 9600 There are 6 x-lengths of fencing and 4 y-lengths, so the total length of fencing is Lx xy64 . You need a function of x, so express the given area in terms of x and y, solve for y, then make a substitution. 7200 3 2400 xy y x Lx x x x x 64 2400 6 9600 2 x 40 Lx xx Lx x x x x 6 9600 6 9600 6 9600 06 9600 1 2 2 2 , etc. 40 You can reject –40, of course. 3 The domain of the length function is 0, . It has one critical number: 40. x can’t be zero or negative; it can be any positive number. In interval notation, the domain of the length function is 0, . A critical number of a function is a number in the function’s domain where the derivative equals zero or is undefined. Lx is defined for all x-values in the domain. And you found its zeros in Problem 2, namely, 40; only positive 40 is in the domain. That’s the only critical number. 4 A 120-foot-by-60-foot corral will minimize the total fencing needed; 480 feet of fencing is needed to build the corral. Lx is negative for x-values less than 40 and positive for x-values greater than 40. Thus, Lx is decreasing until 40 and increasing after 40, and, therefore Lx hits a minimum at x 40. An x-value of 40 gives you a 120-by-60-foot corral with 480 total feet of fencing. 5 (a) vt tt a tt 38 4 68 2 st tt t vt st tt a tv ts tt 32 2 44 8 38 4 68 (b) s t 6. This tells you the rate of change of the acceleration. 364 UNIT 4 Differentiation st 6. The third derivative of s is the first derivative of a, the acceleration. Thus st tells you the rate of change of the acceleration. Acceleration for the particle in this prob- lem would be given in terms of meters per second second . The constant rate of change of the acceleration, namely 6, means that the acceleration of the particle is increasing 6 meters per second second each second. If it’s a bit difficult to wrap your mind around that, no worries, you’re not alone. 6 Yes it does. From t 0 seconds till t 2 3 seconds, the particle is moving to the right. At 2 3 seconds, it reverses direction, and moves to the left till t 2 seconds . It then reverses direction again and moves to the right indefinitely. Set the velocity equal to zero and solve: v tt t tt tt tt 38 4 03 84 03 22 2 3 2 2 or 2 If there are any turnaround points, they must occur when the velocity is zero. But a zero velocity does not guarantee that you’ve got a turnaround point. You must also check that the particle changes direction. You can easily check (in your head) that if you plug a positive number less than 2 3 , say 1 2, into t in the factored form of v t , you’ll get a negative times a negative. That’s a positive, so from zero seconds till 2 3 second, the particle is moving to the right. Plugging 1 into t gives you positive times negative, or a negative answer, so from 2 3 second till 2 seconds, the particle is moving to the left. Finally, plugging 3 into t gives you positive times positive, or a positive answer, so the particle is moving right after 2 seconds. 7 (a) Total displacement is 16.

To get the total distance traveled, you need to add the lengths of the three legs of the trip. The moving-right leg from zero seconds till 2 3 seconds, the moving-left leg from 2 3 seconds till 2 seconds, and the moving-right leg from 2 seconds till 4 seconds.

Note that since you were told that the y leg is shrinking, dy dt must be negative. 9 –10 square inches per minute. The area of a right triangle equals one-half the product of the legs, and it’s given that the legs are equal when the area is 50: Axy xy xy 1 2 50 1 2 100 So, x and y are, obviously, both equal to 10.

At the critical moment in Problem 9, both x and y equal 10; x is growing at 3 inches/minute, and y is shrinking at 5 inches/minute.

Just plug in and finish. dA dt dx dt y dy dt x 1 2 1 2 35 51325 CHAPTER 13 More Differentiation Problems: Going Off on a Tangent 367 More Differentiation Problems: Going Off on a Tangent I n this chapter, you see three more applications of differentiation: tangent and normal line problems, linear approximation problems, and economics problems. The common thread tying these problems together is the idea of a line tangent to a curve — which should come as no surprise since the meaning of the derivative of a curve is the slope of the tangent line. The problems in this chapter are all “practical” applications of differentiation in a sense, but some of them are — to be honest — much more likely to be found in a math book than in the real world. But at the other end of the spectrum, you encounter problems here like the economics problem of finding maximum profit. What could be more practical than that? Chapter 13 IN THIS CHAPTER » Tangling with tangents » Negotiating normals » Lining up for linear approximations » Profiting from business and economics problems » Doing 37 in your head 368 UNIT 4 Differentiation Tangents and Normals: Joined at the Hip In everyday life, it’s perfectly normal to go off on a tangent now and then. In calculus, on the other hand, there is nothing at all normal about a tangent. You need only note a couple of points before you’re ready to try some problems: » At its point of tangency, a tangent line has the same slope as the curve it’s tangent to. In calculus, whenever a problem involves slope, you should immediately think derivative. The derivative is the key to all tangent line problems. » At its point of intersection to a curve, a normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line drawn at that same point. Perpendicular lines have slopes that are opposite reciprocals. So, for a normal line problem you just use the derivative to get the slope of the tangent line, and then the opposite reciprocal of that gives you the slope of the normal line. Ready to try a few problems? Say, that reminds me. I once had this problem with my carburetor. I took my car into the shop, and the mechanic told me the problem would be easy to fix, but when I went back to pick up my car . . . Hey, wait a minute. Where was I? I guess I sort of went off on a tangent. Ha Ha Ha Ha. I really crack myself up. The tangent line problem I bet there have been several times, just in the last month, when you’ve wanted to determine the location of a line through a given point that’s tangent to a given curve. Let’s walk through a problem to see how you do it. Determine the points of tangency of the lines through the point 11, that are tangent to the parabola y x 2. Here’s what you do. If you graph the parabola and plot the point, you can see that there are two ways to draw a tangent line from 11, : up to the right and up to the left. See Figure 13-1. FIGURE 13-1: The parabola y x 2 and two tangent lines through 11, . CHAPTER 13 More Differentiation Problems: Going Off on a Tangent 369 The key to this problem is in the meaning of the derivative. Don’t forget: The derivative of a function at a given point is the slope of the tangent line at that point. So, all you have to do is set the derivative of the parabola equal to the slope of the tangent line and solve: 1. Because the equation of the parabola is y x 2, you can take a general point on the parabola, xy, , and substitute x 2 for y. So, label the two points of tangency xx, 2 . 2. Take the derivative of the parabola. yx y x 2 2 3. Using the slope formula, yy xx 21 21 , set the slope of each tangent line from 11, to xx, 2 equal to the derivative at xx, 2 , which is 2x, and solve for x. (By the way, the math you do in this step may make more sense to you if you think of it as applying to just one of the tangent lines — say, the one going up to the right — but the math actually applies to both tangent lines simultaneously.) yy xx 21 21 (the slope of the tangent line) = y (the derivative) x x x xx x xx x xx 2 2 22 2 1 1 2 12 1 12 2 02 1 x 22 41 1 21 28 2 22 2 2 12 2 (quadratic formula) So, the x-coordinates of the points of tangency are 12 and 12 . 4. Plug each of these x-coordinates into y x 2 to obtain the y-coordinates. y 12 12 22 32 2 2 y 12 12 22 32 2 2 Thus, the two points of tangency are 12 32 2, and 12 32 2, , or about 24 58., . and 04 02., . . 370 UNIT 4 Differentiation The normal line problem Here’s the companion problem to the tangent line problem in the previous section. Find the points of perpendicularity for all normal lines to the parabola, y x 1 16 2, that pass through the point 315, . Graph the parabola and plot the point 315, . Now, before you do the math, try to estimate the locations of all normal lines. How many can you see? It’s fairly easy to see that, starting at 315, , one normal line goes down and to the right and another goes down to the left. But did you see that there’s actually a second normal line that goes down to the left? No worries if you didn’t see it, because when you do the math, you get all three solutions. Making common-sense estimates enhances mathematical understanding. When doing calculus, or any math for that matter, come up with a common-sense, ballpark estimate of the solution to a problem before doing the math (when possible and time permitting). This deepens your understanding of the concepts involved and provides a check to the mathematical solution. (This is a powerful math strategy — take my word for it — despite the fact that in this particular problem, most people will find, at most, two of the three normal lines using an eyeball estimate.) Figure 13-2 shows the parabola and the three normal lines. Looking at the figure, you can appreciate how practical this problem is. It’ll really come in handy if you happen to find yourself standing inside the curve of a parabolic wall, and you want to know the precise location of the three points on the wall where you could throw a ball and have it bounce straight back to you. The solution is very similar to the solution of the tangent line problem, except that in this problem you use the rule for the slopes of perpendicular lines. FIGURE 13-2: The parabola y x 1 16 2 and three normal lines through 315, . CHAPTER 13 More Differentiation Problems: Going Off on a Tangent 371 Each normal line in Figure 13-2 is perpendicular to the tangent line drawn at the point where the normal meets the curve. So, the slope of each normal line is the opposite reciprocal of the slope of the corresponding tangent line  — which, of course, is given by the derivative. So here goes: 1. Take a general point, xy, , on the parabola y x 1 16 2, and substitute 1 16 2x for y. So, label each point of perpendicularity xx, 1 16 2 . 2. Take the derivative of the parabola. yx y x 1 16 1 8 2 3. Using the slope formula, yy xx 21 21 , set the slope of each normal line from 315, to xx, 1 16 2 equal to the opposite reciprocal of the derivative at xx, 1 16 2 , and solve for x. 1 16 15 3 8 1 16 15 824 112 384 0 2 3 3 x xx xx x xx (The derivative is or and its opposite reciprocal is 1 88 x x thus by cross-multiplication and distribution) aft 8 x .) ( ( eer bringing all terms to one side and multiplying both sidees by 16) Now, there’s no easy way to get exact solutions to this cubic (3rd-degree) equation like the way the quadratic formula gives you the exact solutions to a 2nd-degree equation. Instead, you can graph y xx 3 112 384, and the x-intercepts give you the solutions, but with this method, there’s no guarantee you’ll get exact solutions. (If you don’t, the decimal approximations you get will be good enough.) Here, however, you luck out — actually, I had something to do with it — and get the exact solutions of 8, 4, and 12. (You should graph the cubic function so you see how this works.) 4. Plug each of these x-coordinates into y x 1 16 2 to obtain the y-coordinates. y yy 1 16 8 1 16 4 1 16 12 41 9 22 2 Thus, the three points of normalcy are 84, , 41, , and 12 9,  — play ball! 372 UNIT 4 Differentiation 1 Two lines through the point 13, are tangent to the parabola y x 2. Determine the points of tangency. 2 The Earth has a radius of 4000 miles. Say you’re standing on the shore and your eyes are 53 36 . above the surface of the water. How far out can you see to the horizon before the Earth’s curvature makes the water dip below the horizon? See the following figure. CHAPTER 13 More Differentiation Problems: Going Off on a Tangent 373 3 Find the points of normalcy for all lines through 01, normal to the curve y x 4. The results might surprise you. Before you begin solving this problem, graph y x 4 and put the cursor at 01, . Now guess where normal lines will be and whether they represent the shortest paths or longest paths from 01, to y x 4. Note: Do ZoomSqr to get the distances on the graph to appear properly proportional to each other. 4 An ill-prepared adventurer has run out of water on a hot, sunny day in the desert. He’s 30 miles due north and 7 miles due east of his camp. His map shows a winding river — that by some odd coincidence happens to flow according to the function y xx x10 10 10 5 sincos (where the camp lies at the origin; see the following figure). What point along the river is closest to him? He figures that he and his camel can just barely make it another 15 miles or so. (Hint: The closest point must occur at a point of normalcy.) 374 UNIT 4 Differentiation Straight Shooting with Linear Approximations Because ordinary functions are locally linear (that’s straight) — and the further you zoom in on them, the straighter they look — a line tangent to a function is a good approximation of the function near the point of tangency. Figure 13-3 shows the graph of fx x() and a line tan- gent to the function at the point 93, . You can see that near 93, , the curve and the tangent line are virtually indistinguishable. Determining the equation of this tangent line is a breeze. You’ve got a point, 93, , and the slope is given by the derivative of f at 9: fx xx fx x x f 12 121 2 1 2 9 1 29 1 6 / / (power rule) Now just take this slope (this derivative) of 1 6 and the point 93, , and plug them into point- slope form: y ym xx yx yx 11 3 1 6 9 3 1 6 9 That’s the equation of the line tangent to fx x at 93, . I suppose you might be wondering why I wrote the equation as y x3 1 6 9 . It might seem more natural to put the 3 to the right of 1 6 9x , which, of course, would also be correct. And I could have simplified the equation further, writing it in y mx b form. I explain later in this section why I wrote it the way I did. (If you have your graphing calculator handy, graph fx x and the tangent line. Zoom in on the point 93, a couple times. You’ll see that — as you zoom in — the curve gets straighter and straighter and the curve and tangent line get closer and closer to each other.) FIGURE 13-3: The graph of fx x() and a line tangent to the curve at 93, . CHAPTER 13 More Differentiation Problems: Going Off on a Tangent 375 Now, say you want to approximate the square root of 10. Because 10 is pretty close to 9, and because you can see from Figure 13-3 that fx and its tangent line are close to each other at x 10, the y-coordinate of the line at x 10 is a good approximation of the function value at x 10, namely 10 . Just plug 10 into the line equation for your approximation: y x3 1 6 9 3 1 6 10 9 3 1 6 3 1 6 Thus, the square root of 10 is about 3 1 6 . This is only about 0.004 more than the exact answer of 3.1623. . . . The error is roughly a tenth of one percent. Now I can explain why I wrote the equation for the tangent line the way I did. This form makes it easier to do the computation and easier to understand what’s going on when you compute an approximation. Here’s why. You know that the line goes through the point 93, , right? And you know the slope of the line is 1 6. So, you can start at 93, and go to the right (or left) along the line in a stair-step fashion, as shown in Figure 13-4: over 1, up 1 6; over 1, up 1 6; and so on. (Note that since slope rise run , when the run is 1 [as shown in Figure 13-4], the rise equals the slope.) So, when you’re doing an approximation, you start at a y-value of 3 and go up 1 6 for each 1 you go to the right. Or if you go to the left, you go down 1 6 for each 1 you go to the left. When the line equation is written like y x3 1 6 9 , the computation of an approximation parallels this stair-step scheme. Figure 13-4 shows the approximate values for the square roots of 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12. Here’s how you come up with these values. To get to 8, for example, from 93, , you go 1 to the left, so you go down 1 6 to 2 5 6 ; or to get to 11 from 93, , you go two to the right, so you go up two-sixths to 3 2 6 3 1 3 or . (If you go to the right one-half to 9 1 2 , you go up half of a sixth, that’s a twelfth, to 3 1 12 , the approximate square root of 9 1 2 .) FIGURE 13-4: The linear approximation line and several of its points. 376 UNIT 4 Differentiation The following list shows the size of the errors for the approximations shown in Figure 13-4. Note that the errors grow as you get further from the point of tangency 93, . Also, the errors grow faster when going down from 9 to 8 then 7, and so on, than going up from 9 to 10 then 11, and so on; errors often grow faster in one direction than the other with linear approximations because of the shape of the curve. 70 8 80 2 10 01 11 05 12 10 :. % :. % :. % :. % :. % error error error error error Linear approximation equation: Here’s the general form for the equation of the tangent line that you use for a linear approximation. The values of a function fx can be approximated by the values of the tangent line l x near the point of tangency, xf x00, , where l xf xf xx x00 0 This is less complicated than it looks. It’s just the gussied-up calculus version of the point- slope equation of a line you’ve known since Algebra I, y ym xx11 , with the y1 moved to the right side: y ym xx11 This equation and the equation for l x differ only in the symbols used; the meaning of both equations — term for term — is identical. And notice how they both resemble the equation of the tangent line in Figure 13-4. Look for algebra-calculus and geometry-calculus connections. Whenever possible, try to see the basic algebra or geometry concepts at the heart of fancy-looking calculus concepts. Once you get the hang of linear approximation, you can impress your friends by approximating things like 70 3 in your head — like this: Bingo! 4 1 8 . How did I do it? Here you go. Q. Use linear approximation to estimate 70 3 . A. 4 1 8 1. Find a perfect cube root near 70 3 . You notice that 70 3 is near a no-brainer, 64 3 , which, of course, is 4. That gives you the point 64 4, on the graph of y x 3 . 2. Find the slope of y x 3 (which is the slope of the tangent line) at x 64. y x 1 3 23/ , so the slope at 64 is 1 48 . CHAPTER 13 More Differentiation Problems: Going Off on a Tangent 377 This tells you that — to approximate cube roots near 64 — you add (or subtract) 1 48 to 4 for each increase (or decrease) of one from 64. For example, the cube root of 65 is about 4 1 48 ; the cube root of 66 is about 4 2 48 , or 4 1 24 ; the cube root of 67 is about 4 3 48 , or 4 1 16 ; and the cube root of 63 is about 3 47 48 . Since 70 is 6 more than 64, the answer to the question is that 70 3 is about 4 6 48 , or 4 1 8 . You’re done, but let’s keep going and obtain the linear approximation equation. You can use this equation to approximate cube roots of numbers near 64 (integers and non-integers). 3. Use the point-slope form to write the equation of the tangent line at 64 4, . y ym xx yx yx 11 4 1 48 64 4 1 48 64 4. Plug 70 into x for your approximation: y 4 1 48 70 64 4 6 48 4 1 8 You didn’t need this equation to answer the current question, but you should know how to come up with a linear approximation equation and how to use it. For Problems 5 through 8, make the indicated estimates, and, whether you need it or not, deter- mine the applicable linear approximation equation. (Some students may prefer to always use the linear approximation equation; others might like to use the shortcut that I just explained.) 5 Estimate the 4th root of 17. 6 Approximate 3015. . 378 UNIT 4 Differentiation 7 Estimate sin 180 (180 is one degree, of course). 8 Approximate ln e10 5 . Business and Economics Problems Believe it or not, calculus is actually used in the real world of business and economics — learn calculus and increase your profits! Tell me: When you’re driving around an upscale part of town and you pass by a huge home, what’s the first thing that comes to your mind? I bet it’s “Just look at that home! That guy (or gal) must know calculus.” Managing marginals in economics Look again at Figures 13-3 and 13-4 in the previous section. Recall that the derivative and thus the slope of y x at 9, 3 is 1 6, and that the tangent line at this point can be used to approxi- mate the function near the point of tangency. So, as you go over 1 from 9 to 10 along the func- tion itself, you go up about 1 6. And, thus, 10 is about 1 6 more than 9 . In economics, that little bit (like the 1 6) is called a marginal. Marginal cost, marginal revenue, and marginal profit work a lot like linear approximation. Marginal cost, marginal revenue, and marginal profit all involve how much a function goes up (or down) as you go over 1 to the right — just like with linear approximation. Say you’ve got a cost function that gives you the total cost, C x , of producing x items. See Figure 13-5. Look at the blown-up square on the right in the figure. The derivative of C x at the point of tangency gives you the slope of the tangent line and thus the amount you go up as you go 1 to the right along the tangent line. (This amount is labeled in the figure as marginal cost.) Going 1 to the right along the cost function itself shows you the increase in cost of producing one more item. (This is labeled as the extra cost.) Because the tangent line is a good approximation of the cost function, the derivative of C — called the marginal cost — is the approximate increase in cost of producing one more item. Marginal revenue and marginal profit work the same way. CHAPTER 13 More Differentiation Problems: Going Off on a Tangent 379 Definitions of marginal cost, marginal revenue, and marginal profit: Marginal cost equals the derivative of the cost function. Marginal revenue equals the derivative of the revenue function. Marginal profit equals the derivative of the profit function. (Marginal cost and marginal revenue are almost always positive; marginal profit can be posi- tive or negative.) Before doing a problem involving marginals, there’s one more piece of business to take care of. A demand function tells you how many items will be purchased (what the demand will be) given the price. The lower the price, of course, the higher the demand; and the higher the price, the lower the demand. You’d think that the number purchased should be a function of the price — input a price and find out how many items people will buy at that price — but tradi- tionally, a demand function is written the other way around. The price is expressed as a func- tion of the number demanded. I know that seems a bit odd, but don’t sweat it — the function works either way. Think of it like this: If a retailer wants to sell a given number of items, the demand function tells the retailer what they should set the selling price at. Okay, so here’s the problem. A widget manufacturer determines that the demand function for their widgets is p x 1000 where p is the price of a widget and x is the number of widgets demanded. (Note that a demand function like this can also be called a price function.) The cost of producing x widgets is given by the following cost function: C xx x10 100 10 000, FIGURE 13-5: The graph of a cost function C x . 380 UNIT 4 Differentiation Determine the marginal cost, marginal revenue, and marginal profit at x 100 widgets. Also, how many widgets should be manufactured, what should they be sold for to produce the maxi- mum profit, and what is that maximum profit? Marginal cost Marginal cost is the derivative of the cost function, so take the derivative and evaluate it at x 100: Cx xx Cx x C 10 100 10 000 10 50 100 10 , (power rule) 50 100 10 50 10 15 Thus, the marginal cost at x 100 is $15 — this is the approximate cost of producing the 101st widget. Marginal revenue Revenue, R x , equals the number of items sold, x, times the price, p: R xx p x x x x 1000 1000 (using the demand function)earlier x x xx x x (rationalizing the denominator) 1000 1000 Marginal revenue is the derivative of the revenue function, so take the derivative of R x and evaluate it at x 100: Rx x Rx x R 1000 500 100 500 100 50 (power rule) Thus, the approximate revenue from selling the 101st widget is $50. CHAPTER 13 More Differentiation Problems: Going Off on a Tangent 381 Marginal profit Profit, Px , equals revenue minus cost. So, Px Rx Cx xx x xx 1000 10 100 10 000 10 900 10 000 , , Marginal profit is the derivative of the profit function, so take the derivative of Px , and eval- uate it at x 100: Px xx Px x P 10 900 10 000 10 450 100 10 450 100 10 , 445 35 Selling the 101st widget brings in an approximate profit of $35. Marginal profit shortcuts: Did you notice either of the two shortcuts you could have taken here? First, you can use the fact that Px Rx Cx to determine Px directly, without first determining Px . Then, after getting Px , you just plug 100 into x for your answer. And, if all you want to know is P 100 , you can use the following really short shortcut: PR C100 100 100 50 15 35 This is common sense. If it costs you about $15 to produce the 101st widget and you sell it for about $50, then your profit is about $35. I did it the long way because you need both the profit function, Px , and the marginal profit function, Px , for the following problems. (You will often need to do it the long way.) 382 UNIT 4 Differentiation Maximum profit To determine maximum profit, set the derivative of profit — that’s marginal profit — equal to zero, solve for x, and then plug the result into the profit function: Px x x x x x x 10 450 010 450 10 450 10 450 45 2025 So, maximum profit occurs when 2025 widgets are sold. Plug this into Px : Px xx P 10 900 10 000 2025 10 2025 900 2025 10 000 20 2 , , ,550 900 45 10 000 10 250 , , Thus, the maximum profit is $10,250. (Extra credit: Did you see where I got a bit lazy here? The derivative of the profit function is zero at x 2025, but that doesn’t guarantee that there’s a max at that x-value. There could instead be a min or an inflection point there. You could use either the first or second derivative test [see Chapter 11] to show that it’s actually a max. But I just peeked at a graph of the profit function and saw that it’s sort of an upside-down cup shape, so I knew that there was a max at the top of the cup at x 2025.) Finally, plug the number sold into the demand function to determine the profit-maximizing price: p x p 1000 1000 2025 22 22. So, the maximum profit of $10,250 occurs when the price is set at $22.22. At this price, 2025 widgets will be sold. Figure 13-6 sums up these results. Note that because profit equals rev- enue minus cost, the vertical distance or gap between the revenue and cost functions at a given x-value gives the profit at that x-value. Maximum profit occurs where the gap is greatest. CHAPTER 13 More Differentiation Problems: Going Off on a Tangent 383 And here’s another thing. Because maximum profit occurs where Px 0, and because Px Rx Cx , it follows that the profit will be greatest where 0 Rx Cx   — in other words, where R xC x . And when R xC x , the slopes of the functions’ tangent lines are equal. So, if you were to draw tangent lines to R x and C x where the gap between the two is greatest, these tangents would be parallel. Right about now, you’re probably thinking something like, “Such symmetry, such simple elegance, such beauty! Verily, the mathemat- ics muse seduces the heart as much as the mind.” Yeah, it’s nice all right, but let’s not get carried away. For Problems 9 through 12, use the following demand (or price) and cost functions for the pro- duction and sale of some widgets. px x C xx x 400 0 0002 50 000 100 0 0001 15 3 . ,. . 9 FIGURE 13-6: The revenue and cost functions.

Express a point on the parabola in terms of x. The equation of the parabola is y x 2, so you can take a general point on the parabola xy, and substitute x 2 for y. So your point is xx, 2 . 2. Take the derivative of the parabola. yx y x 2 2 3. Using the slope formula, m yy xx 21 21 , set the slope of the tangent line from 13, to xx, 2 equal to the derivative. Then solve for x. x x x xx x xx xx 2 22 2 3 1 2 32 2 23 0 13 0 x 13or 4. Plug these x-coordinates into y x 2 to get the y-coordinates. y y11 39 2 2 and So, there’s one line through 13, that’s tangent to the parabola at 11, , and another through 13, that’s tangent at 39, . You may want to confirm these answers by graphing the parabola and your two tangent lines: y xy x21 16 39 and 2 The horizon is about 2.83 miles away. 1. Write the equation of the Earth’s circumference as a function of y (see the figure in the problem). xy yx 22 2 22 4000 4000 You can disregard the negative half of this circle because your line of sight will obvi- ously be tangent to the upper half of the Earth. 2.

Using the slope formula, set the slope of the tangent line from your eyes to xx, 400022 equal to the derivative, and then solve for x. Your eyes are 53 36 . above the top of the Earth at the point 0 4000, on the circle. Convert your height to miles; that’s exactly 0.001 miles (what an amazing coincidence!). So, the coordinates of your eyes are 0 4000 001,. . yy xx m x x x x xx 21 21 22 22 22 2 4000 4000 001 0 4000 4000 . 44000 001 4000 4000 4000 001 22 2 . . x (cross-multiplication) 44000 3 22x (Use your calculator.) 9999 999 400022. x (Now square both sides.) mi 15 999 992 4000 8 22 283 22 2 ,, . x x x lles Many people are surprised that the horizon is so close. What do you think? By the way, you can solve this problem much more quickly with some basic high school geometry; no calculus is needed. Can you do it? 3 The points of normalcy are 0 915 0 702., . , 0 519 0 073., . , 00, , 0 519 0 073., . , and 0 915 0 702., . . 1.

There are x-intercepts at about –0.915, –0.519, 0.519, and 0.915. Dig those palindromic numbers! 4. Plug these four solutions into y x 4 to get the y-coordinates (there’s also the x 0 no-brainer). 0 519 0 519 0 073 0 915 0 915 0 702 44 44 .. ~. .. ~. You’re done. Five normal lines can be drawn. The points of normalcy are 0 915 0 702., . , 0 519 0 073., . , 00, , 0 519 0 073., . , and 0 915 0 702., . . I find this result interesting, first, because there are so many normal lines, and second, because the normal lines from 01, to 0 915 0 702., . , 00, , and 0 915 0 702., . are all the shortest paths (compared to other points in their respective vicinities). The other two normal lines are the longest paths. This is curious: When a curve is concave away from a point, a normal to the curve can only be a local shortest path, so you might think that in the current problem, where y x 4 is everywhere concave toward 01, , you could get only locally longest paths. But it turns out that when a curve is concave toward a point, you can get either a local shortest or a local longest path. Don’t report me! I played slightly fast and loose with the math for the x 0 solu- tion. Did you notice that x 0 doesn’t work if you plug it back into the equation x x x 4 3 1 0 1 4 because both denominators become zero? However — promise not to leak this to your calculus teacher — this is okay here because both sides of the equation become non zero number zero . (Actually, they’re both 1 0 , but something like 5 0 2 0 would also work.) Non-zero over zero means a vertical line with unde- fined slope. So, the 1 0 1 0 tells you that you have a vertical normal line at x 0. 4 The closest point is 6111526., . , which is 14.77 miles away. 1. Express a point on the curve in terms of x: x xx x,sin cos 10 10 10 5 2. Take the derivative. y xx x y xx x 10 10 10 5 10 10 1 10 10 1 5 1 1 5 sincos cossin cos 00 2 5 1sin x 3.

Solve on your calculator by graphing the following equation and finding the x intercepts: y xx x x xx 30 10 10 10 5 7 1 10 2 5 1 sincos cossin Your calculator’s window settings. It’s a bit tricky to find the x-intercepts for this gnarly function. You have to play around with your calculator’s window settings a bit. And don’t forget that your calculator will draw vertical asymptotes that look like zeros of the function, but are not. Now, it turns out that this function has an infinite number of x-intercepts (I think). There’s one between x 18 and –19 and there are more at bigger negatives. And there’s one between x 97 and 98 and there are more at bigger positives. But these zeros represent points on the river so far away that they need not be considered. Only three zeros are plausible candidates for the closest trip to the river. To see the first candidate zero, set Xmin 1, Xmax 10, Xscl 1, Ymin 5, Ymax 25, and Yscl 5. To see the other two, set Xmin 10, Xmax 30, Xscl 1, Ymin 2, Ymax 10, and Yscl 1. These zeros are at roughly 6.11, 13.75, and 20.58. 4. Plug the zeros into the original function to obtain the y-coordinates. You get the following points of normalcy: 6111526., . , 13 75 14 32., . , and 20 58 23 80., . . 5. Use the distance formula, D xx yy21 2 21 2 , to find the distance from our parched adventurer to the three points of normalcy. The distances are 14.77 miles to 6111526., . , 17.07 miles to 13 75 14 32., . , and 14.93 miles to 20 58 23 80., . . Using his trusty compass, he heads mostly south and a little west to 6111526., . . An added benefit of this route is that it’s in the direction of his camp. 5 The approximation is 2 1 32 or 2.03125. 1. Find a “round” number near 17 where the 4th root is very easy to get: that’s 16. 16 2 4 . So, the point 16 2, is on fx x 4 . 2.

This negative profit for the 1601st widget tells you that the firm would lose money if it were to produce and sell that widget. Therefore, it will obviously want to produce and sell fewer widgets than that. See the solution to the next problem. 12 (a) 974 widgets Like with any maximization problem, to find the maximum profit, you set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x.

Thus, the firm should produce and sell 974 widgets to maximize profits. (It’s kind of obvious in this problem that the profit function hits a maximum at this x-value; but, if you want to be more rigorous, you should show that this x-value is indeed where a maximum occurs, as opposed to a minimum or a horizontal inflection point.) I did this problem like any maximization problem, without mentioning marginals. But, as you know, the first derivative of the profit is the marginal profit. So, the preceding math shows that the marginal profit is zero when 974 widgets are sold. Do you see why the maximum profit should occur where the marginal profit equals zero? 392 UNIT 4 Differentiation (b) $143,877.52 Determine the profit function and evaluate it at x 974.

Chapter 19 Quiz Answers to Chapter 19 Quiz CHAPTER 14 Intro to Integration and Approximating Area 399 Intro to Integration and Approximating Area S ince you’re still reading this book, I presume that means you survived differentiation (Chapters 9 through 13). Now you begin the second major topic in calculus: integration. Just as two simple ideas lie at the heart of differentiation — rate (like miles per hour) and the steepness or slope of a curve — integration can also be understood in terms of two simple ideas: adding up small pieces of something and the area under a curve. In this chapter, I intro- duce you to these two fundamental concepts. By the way, much of the material in this chapter and the first section of Chapter  15 is both more difficult and less useful than what follows it. If ever there was a time for the perennial complaint — “What is the point of learning this stuff?” — this is it. Now, some calculus teach- ers would give you all sorts of fancy arguments and pedagogical justifications for why this material is taught, but, let’s be honest, the sole purpose of teaching these topics is to inflict maximum pain on calculus students. Well, you’re stuck with it, so deal with it. The good news is that this material will make much of what comes later seem easy by comparison. Chapter 14 IN THIS CHAPTER » Integrating — adding it all up » Approximating areas and sizing up sigma sums » Using the definite integral to get exact areas » Reconnoitering rectangles » Totaling up trapezoids » Applying Simpson’s rule: Calculus for Bart and Homer 400 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Integration: Just Fancy Addition Consider the lamp on the left in Figure  14-1. Say you want to determine the volume of the lamp’s base. Why would you want to do that? Beats me. Anyway, a formula for the volume of such a weird shape doesn’t exist, so you can’t calculate the volume directly. (Archimedes had his “Eureka!” moment when he calculated the volume of another weird shape. Remember his method? Hint: If you try his method on a lamp, make sure you unplug it first!) Okay, so there’s no formula for the volume of the lamp base. However, with integration, you can calculate the volume. Imagine that the base is cut up into thin, horizontal slices as shown on the right in Figure 14-1. Can you see that each slice is shaped like a thin pancake? Now, because there is a formula for the volume of a pancake (a pancake is just a very short cylinder), you can determine the total volume of the base by simply calculating the volume of each pancake-shaped slice and then adding up the volumes. That’s integration in a nutshell. But, of course, if that’s all there was to integration, there wouldn’t be such a fuss about it — certainly not enough to vault Newton, Leibnitz, and other calculus all-stars into the mathe- matics hall of fame. What makes integration one of the great achievements in the history of mathematics is that — to continue with the lamp example — it gives you the exact volume of the lamp’s base by sort of cutting it into an infinite number of infinitely thin slices. Now that is something. If you cut the lamp into fewer than an infinite number of slices, you can get only a very good approximation of the total volume — not the exact answer — because each pancake- shaped slice would have a weird, curved edge, which would cause a small error when computing the volume of the slice with the cylinder formula. Integration has an elegant symbol: . You’ve probably seen it before — maybe in one of those cartoons with some Einstein guy in front of a blackboard filled with indecipherable gobble- dygook. Soon, this will be you. That’s right: You’ll be filling up pages in your notebook with equations containing the integration symbol. Onlookers will be amazed and envious. You can think of the integration symbol as just an elongated S for “sum up.” So, for our lamp problem, you can write bottom top dB B FIGURE 14-1: A lamp with a curvy base and the base cut into thin horizontal slices. CHAPTER 14 Intro to Integration and Approximating Area 401 where dB means a little bit of the base — actually an infinitely small piece. So the equation just means that if you sum up all the little pieces of the base from the bottom to the top, the result is B, the volume of the whole base. This is a bit oversimplified — I can hear the siren of the math police now — but it’s a good way to think about integration. By the way, thinking of dB as a little or infinitesimal piece of B is an idea you saw before with differentiation (see Chapter 9), where the derivative or slope, dy dx , is equal to the ratio of a little bit of y to a little bit of x, as you shrink the rise run stair step down to an infinitesimal size (see Figure  9-13). Thus, both differentiation and integration involve infinitesimals. So, whenever you see something like a b little pieceofmumbo jumbo it just means that you add up all the little (infinitesimal) pieces of the mumbo jumbo from a to b to get the total of all of the mumbo jumbo from a to b. Or you might see something like t t little pieceofdistance 0 20 sec. sec. which means to add up the little pieces of distance traveled between 0 and 20 seconds to get the total distance traveled during that time span. To sum up  — that’s a pun!  — the mathematical expression to the right of the integration symbol stands for a little bit of something, and integrating such an expression means to add up all the little pieces between some starting point and some ending point to determine the total between the two points. Finding the Area Under a Curve As I discuss in Chapter 9, the most fundamental meaning of a derivative is that it’s a rate, a this per that like miles per hour, and that when you graph the this as a function of the that (like miles as a function of hours), the derivative becomes the slope of the function. In other words, the derivative is a rate, which on a graph appears as a slope. It works in a similar way with integration. The most fundamental meaning of integration is to add up (you might be adding up distances or volumes, for example). And when you depict integration on a graph, you can see the adding-up process as a summing up of little bits of area to arrive at the total area under a curve. Consider Figure 14-2. 402 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series The shaded area in Figure 14-2 can be calculated with the following integral: a b fx dx Look at the thin rectangle in Figure 14-2. It has a height of fx and a width of dx (a little bit of x), so its area (length times width, of course) is given by fx dx . The above integral tells you to add up the areas of all the narrow rectangular strips between a and b under the curve fx . As the strips get narrower and narrower, you get a better and better estimate of the area. The power of integration lies in the fact that it gives you the exact area by sort of adding up an infi- nite number of infinitely thin rectangles. If you’re doing a problem where both the x and y axes are labeled in a unit of length, say, feet, then each thin rectangle measures so many feet by so many feet, and its area — length times width — is some number of square feet. In this case, when you integrate to get the total area under the curve between a and b, your final answer will be an amount of — what else? — area. But you can use this adding-up-areas-of-rectangles scheme to add up tiny bits of anything — distance, volume, or energy, for example. In other words, the area under the curve doesn’t have to stand for an actual area. If, for example, the units on the x-axis are hours and the y-axis is labeled in miles per hour, then, because rate times time equals distance (and because miles hour hours miles), the area of each rect- angle represents an amount of distance (in miles), and the total area gives you the total dis- tance traveled during the given time interval. Or if the x-axis is labeled in hours and the y-axis in kilowatts of electrical power — in which case the curve gives power usage as a function of time — then the area of each rectangular strip (kilowatts times hours) represents a number of kilowatt-hours of energy. In that case, the total area under the curve gives you the total number of kilowatt-hours of energy consumption between two points in time. Figure 14-3 shows how you would do the lamp volume problem, from earlier in this chapter, by adding up areas. In this graph, the function Ah gives the cross-sectional area of a thin pan- cake slice of the lamp as a function of its height measured from the bottom of the lamp. So, this time, the h-axis is labeled in inches (that’s h as in height from the bottom of the lamp), and the y-axis is labeled in square inches, and thus each thin rectangle has a width measured in inches FIGURE 14-2: Integrating fx from x a to x b means finding the area under the curve between a and b. CHAPTER 14 Intro to Integration and Approximating Area 403 and a height measured in square inches. The area of each rectangle, therefore, represents inches times square inches, or cubic inches of volume. The area of the thin rectangle in Figure 14-3 represents the volume of the thin pancake slice of the lamp 5 inches up from the bottom of the base. The total shaded area and thus the volume of the lamp’s base is given by the following integral: This integral tells you to add up the volumes of all the thin pancake slices from 0 to 15 inches (that is, from the bottom to the top of the lamp’s base), each slice having a volume given by Ah (its cross-sectional area) times dh (its height or thickness). (By the way, Figure  14-3 resembles the left half of the lamp’s base [tilted on its side], but it’s not that. It has a similar shape because where the lamp base is wide, the corresponding circular slice has a large cross- sectional area.) Okay, enough of this introductory stuff. In the next section, you actually calculate some areas. Approximating Area Before explaining how to calculate exact areas, I want to show you how to approximate areas. The approximation method is useful not only because it lays the groundwork for the exact method  — integration  — but because for some curves, integration is impossible, and an approximation of area is the best you can do. The material in this section — using rectangles to approximate the area of strange shapes — is part of every calculus course because integration rests on this foundation. But, in a sense, this material doesn’t involve calculus at all. You could do everything in this section without calcu- lus, and if calculus had never been invented, you could still approximate area with the methods described here. FIGURE 14-3: This shaded area gives you the volume of the base of the lamp in Figure 14-1. (Note: The shape of A(h) is close to what it should be, but it’s not precise.) 404 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Approximating area with left sums Say you want the exact area under the curve fx x 2 1 between x 0 and x 3. See the shaded area on the graph on the left in Figure 14-4. You can get a rough estimate of the total area by drawing three rectangles under the curve, as shown on the right in Figure 14-4, and then adding up their areas. The rectangles in Figure  14-4 represent a so-called left sum because the height of each rec- tangle is determined by where the upper left corner of each rectangle touches the curve. Each rectangle has a width of 1 and the height of each is given by the height of the function at the rectangle’s left edge. So, rectangle number 1 has a height of f 00 11 2 ; its area ( )length widthheightwidthor is thus 11 or 1. Rectangle 2 has a height of f 11 12 2 , so its area is 2 1, or 2. And rectangle 3 has a height of f 22 15 2 , so its area is 51, or 5. Adding these three areas gives you a total of 12 5, or 8. You can see that this is an underestimate of the total area under the curve because of the three gaps between the rectangles and the curve shown in Figure 14-4. For a better estimate, double the number of rectangles to six. Figure  14-5 shows six “left” rectangles under the curve and also how the six rectangles begin to fill up the three gaps you see in Figure 14-4. FIGURE 14-4: The exact area under fx x 2 1 between x 0 and x 3 (shown on the left) is approximated by the area of three rectangles (shown on the right). FIGURE 14-5: Six “left” rectangles approximate the area under fx x 2 1 from 0 to 3. CHAPTER 14 Intro to Integration and Approximating Area 405 See the three small shaded rectangles in the graph on the right in Figure  14-5? They sit on top of the three rectangles from Figure 14-4 and represent how much the area estimate has improved by using six rectangles instead of three. Now total up the areas of the six rectangles. Each has a width of 0.5 and the heights are ff ff00 51 15,. ,, ., and so on. I’ll spare you the arithmetic. Here’s the total: 0 50 625 11 625 25 3 625 9 875.. .. .. . This is a better estimate, but it’s still an underestimate because of the six small gaps you can see on the left graph in Figure 14-5. Table 14-1 shows the area estimates given by 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, and 384 rectangles. You don’t have to double the number of rectangles each time like I’ve done here. You can use any number of rectangles of equal width that you want. I just like the doubling scheme because, with each doubling, the gaps are plugged up more and more in the way shown in Figure 14-5. Any guesses as to where the estimates in Table 14-1 are headed? Looks like 12 to me. Here’s the fancy-pants formula for a left-rectangle sum. The left rectangle rule: You can approximate the exact area under a curve between a and b, a b fx dx , with a sum of left rectangles of equal width given by the following formula. In gen- eral, the more rectangles, the better the estimate. L ba n fx fx fx fxnn012 1... where n is the number of rectangles, ba n is the width of each rectangle, x 0 through x n 1 are the x-coordinates of the left edges of the n rectangles, and the function values are the heights of the rectangles. I’d better explain this formula a bit. Look back to the six rectangles shown in Figure 14-5. The width of each rectangle equals the length of the total span from 0 to 3 (which, of course, is 30, or 3) divided by the number of rectangles, 6. That’s what the ba n does in the formula. Table 14-1 Estimates of the Area Under f xx 2 1 from 0 to 3 Given by Increasing Numbers of “Left” Rectangles Number of Rectangles Area Estimate 3 6 12 24 48 96 192 384 8 9 875 10 906 11 445 11 721 11 860 11 930 11 965 . . . . . . . 406 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Now, what about those x’s with the subscripts? The x-coordinate of the left edge of rectangle 1 in Figure 14-5 is called x 0, the right edge of rectangle 1 (which is the same as the left edge of rectangle 2) is at x1, the right edge of rectangle 2 is at x 2, the right edge of rectangle 3 is at x 3, and so on all the way up to the right edge of rectangle 6, which is at x 6. For the six rectangles in Figure 14-5, x 0 is 0, x1 is 0.5, x 2 is 1, x 3 is 1.5, x 4 is 2, x 5 is 2.5, and x 6 is 3. The heights of the six left rectangles in Figure 14-5 occur at their left edges, which are at x 0 through x 5. You don’t use the right edge of the last rectangle, x 6, in a left sum. That’s why the list of function values in the formula stops at x n 1. This all becomes clearer — cross your fingers — when you look at the formula for right rectangles in the next section. Here’s how to use the formula for the six rectangles in Figure 14-5: Lf xf xf xf xf xf x ff 6 012 34 5 30 6 1 2 00 5. ff ff11 522 5 1 2 11 25 23 25 57 25 1 2 19 .. .. . .775 9 875. Note that had I distributed the width of 1 2 to each of the heights after the third line in the solu- tion, you’d have seen the sum of the areas of the six rectangles — which you saw in the par- agraph where I totaled up the area of the six rectangles. The formula just uses the shortcut of first adding up the heights and then multiplying by the width. Approximating area with right sums Now estimate the same area under fx x 2 1 from 0 to 3 with right rectangles. This method works like the left sum method, except each rectangle is drawn so that its right upper corner touches the curve. See Figure 14-6. The heights of the three rectangles in Figure  14-6 are given by the function values at their right edges: ff f12 25 310, , and . Each rectangle has a width of 1, so the areas are 2, 5, and 10, which total 17. You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to see that this time you get an overestimate of the actual area under the curve, as opposed to the underestimate that you FIGURE 14-6: Three right rectangles used to approximate the area under   fx x 2 1 from 0 to 3. CHAPTER 14 Intro to Integration and Approximating Area 407 get with the left-rectangle method I detail in the previous section (more on that in a minute). Table 14-2 shows the improving estimates you get with more and more right rectangles. Looks like these estimates are also headed toward 12. Here’s the formula for a right rectangle sum. The right rectangle rule: You can approximate the exact area under a curve between a and b, a b fx dx , with a sum of right rectangles given by the following formula. In general, the more rectangles, the better the estimate. R ba n fx fx fx fxnn12 3 ..... , where n is the number of rectangles, ba n is the width of each rectangle, x1 through x n are the x-coordinates of the right edges of the n rectangles, and the function values are the heights of the rectangles. If you compare this formula to the one for a left rectangle sum, you get the complete picture about those subscripts. The two formulas are the same except for one thing. Look at the sums of the function values in both formulas. The right sum formula has one value, fx n , that the left sum formula doesn’t have, and the left sum formula has one value, fx 0 , that the right sum formula doesn’t have. All the function values between those two appear in both formulas. You can get a better handle on this by comparing the three left rectangles from Figure 14-4 to the three right rectangles from Figure 14-6. Their areas and totals, which I earlier calculated, are Three left rectangles: Three right rectangles: 12 58 25 110 17 Table 14-2 Estimates of the Area Under f xx 2 1 from 0 to 3 Given by Increasing Numbers of “Right” Rectangles Number of Rectangles Area Estimate 3 6 12 24 48 96 192 384 17 14 375 13 156 12 570 12 283 12 141 12 070 12 035 . . . . . . . 408 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series The values used in the sums of the areas are the same except for the left-most left rectangle value and the right-most right rectangle value. Both sums include rectangles with areas 2 and 5. If you look at how the rectangles are constructed, you can see that the second and third rectangles in Figure 14-4 are the same as the first and second rectangles in Figure 14-6. Approximating area with midpoint sums A third way to approximate areas with rectangles is to make each rectangle cross the curve at the midpoint of its top side. A midpoint sum is usually a much better estimate of area than either a left or a right sum. Figure 14-7 shows why. You can see in Figure 14-7 that the part of each rectangle that’s above the curve looks about the same size as the gap between the rectangle and the curve. A midpoint sum produces such a good estimate because these two errors roughly cancel out each other. For the three rectangles in Figure  14-7, the widths are 1 and the heights are f 05 125.. , f 15 325.. , and f 25 725.. . The total area comes to 11.75. Table 14-3 lists the midpoint sums for the same number of rectangles used in Tables 14-1 and 14-2. Table 14-3 Estimates of the Area Under f xx 2 1 from 0 to 3 Given by Increasing Numbers of “Midpoint” Rectangles Number of Rectangles Area Estimate 3 6 12 24 48 96 192 384 11 75 11 9375 11 9844 11 9961 11 9990 11 9998 11 9999 11 99 . . . . . . . . 9998 FIGURE 14-7: Three midpoint rectangles give you a much better estimate of the area under fx x 2 1. CHAPTER 14 Intro to Integration and Approximating Area 409 If you had any doubts that the left and right sums in Tables 14-1 and 14-2 were heading to 12, Table 14-3 should dispel them. Spoiler alert: Yes, in fact, the exact area is 12. (I show you how to calculate that in several pages in the section “Finding Exact Area with the Definite Integral.”) And to see how much faster the midpoint approximations approach the exact answer of 12 than the left or right approximations, compare the three tables. The error with 6 midpoint rect- angles is about the same as the error with 192 left or right rectangles! Here’s the mumbo jumbo. The midpoint rule: You can approximate the exact area under a curve between a and b, a bfx dx, with a sum of midpoint rectangles given by the following formula. In general, the more rect- angles, the better the estimate. M ba n f xx f xx f xx f xx n nn01 12 23 1 22 22 ..... , where n is the number of rectangles, ba n is the width of each rectangle, x 0 through x n are the n 1 evenly spaced points from a to b, and the function values are the heights of the rectangles. Definition of Riemann sum: All three sums — left, right, and midpoint — are called Riemann sums, after the great German mathematician Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866). Basically, any approximating sum made up of rectangles is a Riemann sum, including weird sums consisting of rectangles of unequal width. Luckily, you won’t have to deal with those in this book or your calculus course. The left, right, and midpoint sums in Tables 14-1, 14-2, and 14-3 are all heading toward 12, and if you could slice up the area into an infinite number of rectangles, you’d get the exact area of 12. But I’m getting ahead of myself. Q. Using 10 right rectangles, estimate the area under fx xln from 1 to 6. A. The approximate area is 6.181. 1. Sketch f xxln and divide the interval from 1 to 6 into ten equal increments. Each increment has a length of 1 2, of course. See the figure in Step 2. 2. Draw a right rectangle for each of the ten increments. You’re doing right rectangles, so put your pen on the right end of the base of the first rectangle (that’s at x 15. ), draw straight up till you hit the curve, and then straight left till you’re directly above the left end of the base (x 1). Finally, going straight down, draw the left side of the first rectangle. See the following figure. I’ve indicated with arrows how you draw the first rectangle. Draw the rest the same way. 410 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 3. Use your calculator to calculate the height of each rectangle. The heights are given by f 15. , f 2 , f 25. , and so on, which are ln.15, ln2, and so on. 4.

(b) How is this approximation related to the area obtained with 10 right rectangles? (Hint: Compare individual rectangles from both estimates.) 2 Approximate the same area again with 10 midpoint rectangles. CHAPTER 14 Intro to Integration and Approximating Area 411 3 Rank the approximations from the example and Problems 1 and 2 from best to worst and defend your rank- ing. Obviously, you’re not allowed to cheat by first finding the exact area with your calculator. 4 Use 8 left, right, and midpoint rect- angles to approximate the area under sin x from 0 to . Getting Fancy with Summation Notation Before I get to the formal definition of the definite integral — that’s the incredible calculus tool that sort of cuts up an area into an infinite number of rectangles and thereby gives you the exact area — there’s one more thing to take care of: summation notation. Summing up the basics For adding up long series of numbers like the rectangle areas in a left, right, or midpoint sum, summation or sigma notation comes in handy. Sigma notation may look fancy and difficult, but it’s really just a shorthand way of writing a long sum. Here’s how it works. Say you wanted to add up the first 100 multiples of 5 — that’s from 5 to 500. You could write out the sum like this: 510152025 490 495 500..... But with sigma notation (sigma, , is the 18th letter of the Greek alphabet), the sum is much more condensed and efficient, and, let’s be honest, it looks pretty cool: i i 1 1005 This notation just tells you to plug 1 in for the i in 5i, then plug 2 into the i in 5i, then 3, then 4, and so on, up to 100. Then you add up the results. So that’s 51 plus 52 plus 53, and so on, up to 5 100. This produces the same thing as writing out the sum the long way. 412 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series The letter i in this example is called the index of summation. The particular letter you use has no significance, though i and k are customary. Here’s one more. If you want to add up 10 11 12 29 30 22 22 2..... , you can write the sum with sigma notation as follows: k k 10 30 2 There’s really nothing to it. Let’s walk through a couple examples step by step. But, first, a piece of business. Pulling stuff out. In a sigma sum problem, you can pull anything through the sigma symbol to the outside except for a function of the index of summation. Q. Evaluate i i 4 12 25 . A. The sum is 3180. 1. Pull the 5 through the sigma symbol: 5 4 12 2 i i 2. Plug 4 into i, then 5, then 6, and so on up to 12, adding up all the terms. 54 56 78 9101112 22 22 22 22 2 3. Finish on your calculator. 5 636 3180 Q. Express 50 60 70 80 150 33 33 3 with sigma notation. A. 1000 4 1 11 3 i i 1. Create the argument (that’s the input) of the sigma function. The jump amount between terms in a long sum will become the coefficient of the index of summation in a sigma sum, so you know that 10i is the basic term of your argument. You want to cube each term, so that gives you the following: 10 3i 2. Set the range of the sum. Ask yourself what i must be to make the first term equal 50 3: That’s 5, of course. And ask the same question about the last term of 150 3: i must be 15. Put the 5 and the 15 on the sigma symbol, like this: i i 5 15 310 Check that plugging 5, then 6, then 7, and so on up to 15 into i produces the original sum. It works. (It’s not a bad idea to do a check like this if you’re new to sigma notation.) CHAPTER 14 Intro to Integration and Approximating Area 413 3. Simplify. i i i i i i 5 15 33 5 15 3 5 15 3 10 1000 1000 4. (Optional) Set the i to begin at zero or one. It’s often desirable to have i begin at 0 or 1. To turn the 5 into a 1, you subtract 4. Then subtract 4 from the 15 as well. To compensate for this subtraction, you add 4 to the i in the argument: 1000 4 1 11 3 i i If you want i to start at zero, you have 1000 5 0 10 3 i i 5 Evaluate i 1 10 4. 6 Evaluate i i i 0 9 211 . 7 Evaluate i ii 1 50 232 . 8 Express the following sum with sigma notation: 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 414 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 9 Express the following sum with sigma notation: 8 27 64 125 216 10 Use sigma notation to express the following: 24 8163264 128 256 512 1024 Writing Riemann sums with sigma notation Let’s use sigma notation to write out the right-rectangle sum for the curve y x 2 1 that you looked at in the section “Approximating Area.” This can get pretty gnarly. Brace yourself. Recall the formula for a right sum from the earlier section “Approximating area with right sums”: R ba n fx fx fx fxnn12 3 ... Here’s the same formula written with sigma notation: R fx ba n n i n i 1 (Note that I could have written this instead as R ba n fxn i n i 1 , which would have more nicely mirrored the formula where the ba n is on the outside. Either way is fine  — they’re equivalent — but I chose to keep the ba n on the inside so that the sum is actually a sum of rectangles. In other words, with the ba n on the inside, the expression after the symbol, fx ba n i , which the symbol tells you to add up, is the area of each rectangle, namely height times base.) CHAPTER 14 Intro to Integration and Approximating Area 415 Now work this out for the six right rectangles in Figure 14-8. You’re figuring the area under x 2 1 between x 0 and x 3 with six rectangles, so the width of each, ba n , is 30 6 or 3 6 or 1 2. So now you’ve got R fx i i6 1 6 1 2 Next, because the width of each rectangle is 1 2, the right edges of the six rectangles fall on the first six multiples of 1 2: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3. These numbers are the x-coordinates of the six points x1 through x 6; they can be generated by the expression 1 2 i, where i equals 1 through 6. You can check that this works by plugging 1 in for i in 1 2 i, then 2, then 3, up to 6. So now you can replace the xi in the formula with 1 2 i, giving you R fi i 6 1 6 1 2 1 2 Your function, fx , is x 2 1 so fi i 1 2 1 2 1 2 , and so now you can write R i i 6 1 6 21 2 1 1 2 If you plug 1 into i, then 2, then 3, and so on up to 6 and do the math, you get the sum of the areas of the rectangles in Figure 14-8. This sigma notation is just a fancy way of writing the sum of the six rectangles. Are we having fun? Hold on, it gets worse — sorry. Now you’re going to write out the general sum for an unknown number, n, of right rectangles. The total span of the area in question is 3, right? You divide this span by the number of rectangles to get the width of each rectangle. With FIGURE 14-8: Six right rectangles approximate the area under fx x 2 1 between 0 and 3. 416 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 6 rectangles, the width of each is 3 6 ; with n rectangles, the width of each is 3 n . And the right edges of the n rectangles are generated by 3 n i , for i equals 1 through n. That gives you R f n i n n i n 1 33 Or, because fx x 2 1, R n i n i n n n i n i n 1 2 1 2 2 3 1 3 9 1 3 i n i n i n i n n i n n 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 27 3 27 3 (Take my word foor it.) 27 3 1 3 1 2 1n i ni n i n For this last step, you pull the 27 3n and the 3 n through the summation symbols  — recall that you’re allowed to pull out anything except for a function of i. You’ve now arrived at a critical step. With a sleight of hand, you’re going to turn the Riemann sum here into a formula in terms of n. (This formula is what you use in the next section to obtain the exact area under the curve.) Now, as almost no one knows, the sum of the first n square numbers, 12 3 22 22... n , equals nn n12 1 6 . (By the way, this 6 has nothing to do with the fact that you used 6 rectangles a couple pages back.) So, you can substitute that expression for the i n i 1 2 in the last line of the sigma notation solution, and at the same time substitute n for i n 1 1 (because that just tells you to add up n 1’s): R n i n n nn n n n n n n i n i n27 3 1 27 12 1 6 3 27 23 3 1 2 1 3 3 3 nnn n nn n n n n n 2 3 32 2 6 3 27 32 6 3 9 27 2 9 2 3 12 27 2 9 2 22 CHAPTER 14 Intro to Integration and Approximating Area 417 The end. Finally! This is the formula for the area of n right rectangles between x 0 and x 3 under the function fx x 2 1. You can use this formula to produce the approximate areas given in Table 14-2. But once you’ve got such a formula, it’d be kind of pointless to produce a table of approximate areas, because you can use the formula to determine the exact area. And it’s a snap. I get to that in a minute in the next section. But first, here are the formulas for n left rectangles and n midpoint rectangles between x 0 and x 3 under the same function, x 2 1. These formulas generate the area approximations in Tables 14-1 and 14-3. The algebra for deriving these formulas is even worse than what we just did for the right rectangle formula, so I decided to skip it. Do you mind? I didn’t think so. L n n M n n n 12 27 2 9 2 12 9 4 2 2 11 Use sigma notation to express a 20-right-rectangle approximation of the area under gx xx 2 3 from 0 to 5. Then compute the approximation. 12 Using your result from Problem 11, write a formula for approximating the area under g from 0 to 5 with n rectangles. And now, what you’ve all been waiting for . . . Finding Exact Area with the Definite Integral Having laid all the necessary groundwork, we’re finally ready to move on to determining exact areas — which is the whole point of integration. You don’t need calculus to do all the approx- imation stuff we just did. 418 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series As you saw with the left, right, and midpoint rectangles in the section “Approximating Area,” the more rectangles you use, the better the approximation. So, “all” you’d have to do to get the exact area under a curve is to use an infinite number of rectangles. Now, you can’t really do that, but with the fantastic invention of limits, this is sort of what happens. Here’s the defini- tion of the definite integral that’s used to compute exact areas. The definite integral (“simple” definition): The exact area under a curve between xa and xb is given by the definite integral, which is defined as the limit of a Riemann sum: a b n i n ifx dx fx ba n lim 1 Is that a thing of beauty or what? This summation (everything to the right of “lim”) is identical to the formula for n right rectangles, Rn, that I give a few pages back. The only difference here is that you take the limit of that formula as the number of rectangles approaches infinity ( ). This definition of the definite integral is the simple version based on the right rectangle for- mula. I give you the real-McCoy definition later, but because all Riemann sums for a specific problem have the same limit — in other words, it doesn’t matter what type of rectangles you use — you might as well use the right-rectangle definition. It’s the least complicated and it’ll always suffice. Let’s have a drum roll. Here, finally, is the exact area under our old friend fx x 2 1 between x 0 and x 3: 0 3 2 1 2 1 12 27 2 9 2 xdxf x ba n n n n i n i n lim lim (This is what we got in the section Writing Reimann s“ uums with sigma notation, after all those steps.)” 12 27 2 9 2 12 27 9 1200 2 (Remember, in a limit probblem, any number divided by infinity equals zero.)) 12 Big surprise. This result is pretty amazing if you think about it. Using the limit process, you get an exact answer of 12 — sort of like 12.00000000 . . . to an infinite number of decimal places — for the area under the smooth, curving function fx x 2 1, based on the areas of flat-topped rect- angles that run along the curve in a jagged, sawtooth fashion. Remarkable! Finding the exact area of 12 by using the limit of a Riemann sum is a lot of work (remember, we first had to determine the formula for n right rectangles). This complicated method of inte- gration is comparable to determining a derivative the hard way by using the formal definition CHAPTER 14 Intro to Integration and Approximating Area 419 that’s based on the difference quotient (see Chapter 9). And just as you stopped using the for- mal definition of the derivative after you learned the differentiation shortcuts, you won’t have to use the formal definition of the definite integral based on a Riemann sum after you learn the shortcut methods in Chapters 15 and 16 — except, that is, on your final exam. Because the limit of all Riemann sums is the same, the limits at infinity of n left rectangles and n midpoint rectangles (for fx x() 2 1 between x 0 and x 3) should give us the same result as the limit at infinity of n right rectangles. The expressions after the following limit symbols are the formulas for n left rectangles and n midpoint rectangles that appear at the end of the section “Writing Riemann sums with sigma notation,” earlier in the chapter. Here’s the left rectangle limit: 0 3 2 2 2 112 27 2 9 2 12 27 2 9 2 1 xdxL n nn lim 22 27 9 12 00 12 And here’s the midpoint rectangle limit: 0 3 2 2 2 112 9 4 12 9 4 12 9 12 01 xdxM nn lim 22 If you’re somewhat incredulous that these limits actually give you the exact area under fx x 2 1 between 0 and 3, you’re not alone. After all, in these limits, as in all limit prob- lems, the arrow-number ( in this example) is only approached; it’s never actually reached. And on top of that, what would it mean to reach infinity? You can’t do it. And regardless of how many rectangles you have, you always have that jagged, sawtooth edge. So how can such a method give you the exact area? Look at it this way. You can tell from Figures 14-4 and 14-5 that the sum of the areas of left rectangles, regardless of their number, will always be an underestimate (this is the case for functions that are increasing over the span in question). And from Figure 14-6, you can see that the sum of the areas of right rectangles, regardless of how many you have, will always be an overestimate (for increasing functions). So, because the limits at infinity of the underestimate and the overestimate are both equal to 12, that must be the exact area. (A similar argument works for decreasing functions.) All Riemann sums for a given problem have the same limit. Not only are the limits at infin- ity of left, right, and midpoint rectangles the same for a given problem, but the limit of any Riemann sum also gives you the same answer. You can have a series of rectangles with unequal widths; you can have a mix of left, right, and midpoint rectangles; or you can construct the rectangles so they touch the curve somewhere other than at their left or right upper corners or 420 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series at the midpoints of their top sides. The only thing that matters is that, in the limit, the width of all the rectangles tends to zero (and from this, it follows that the number of rectangles approaches infinity). This brings us to the following totally extreme, down-and-dirty integra- tion mumbo jumbo that takes all these possibilities into account. The definite integral (real-McCoy definition): The definite integral from xa to xb, a b fx dx , is the number to which all Riemann sums tend as the width of all rectangles tends to zero and as the number of rectangles approaches infinity: a b x i n iifx dx fc x i lim , max 0 1 where xi is the width of the ith rectangle and ci is the x-coordinate of the point where the ith rectangle touches fx . (That “max xi 0” simply guarantees that the width of all the rect- angles approaches zero and that the number of rectangles approaches infinity.) 13 In Problem 11, you estimate the area under gx xx 2 3 from 0 to 5 with 20 right rectangles. The result is about 84.2 square units. Then in Problem 12, you write a formula for the area under g for n rectangles. Use your result from Problem 12 to approximate the area under g from 0 to 5 with 50, 100, 1000, and 10,000 right rectangles. 14 Use your result from Problem 12 and the definition of the definite integral to determine the exact area under gx xx 2 3 from 0 to 5. CHAPTER 14 Intro to Integration and Approximating Area 421 Approximating Area with the Trapezoid Rule and Simpson’s Rule This section covers two more ways to estimate the area under a function. You can use them if for some reason you only want an estimate and not an exact answer — maybe because you’re asked for that on an exam. But these approximation methods and the others you’ve gone over are useful for another reason. There are certain types of functions for which the exact area method doesn’t work. (It’s beyond the scope of this book to explain why this is the case or exactly what these functions are like, so just take my word for it.) So, using an approximation method may be your only choice if you happen to get one of these uncooperative functions. The trapezoid rule With the trapezoid rule, instead of approximating area with rectangles, you do it with — can you guess? — trapezoids. See Figure 14-9. Because of the way trapezoids hug the curve, they give you a much better area estimate than either left or right rectangles. And it turns out that a trapezoid approximation is the average of the left rectangle and right rectangle approximations. Can you see why? (Hint: The area of a trapezoid — say trapezoid 2 in Figure 14-9 — is the average of the areas of the two correspond- ing rectangles in the left and right sums, namely, rectangle 2 in Figure 14-4 and rectangle 2 in Figure 14-6.) Table  14-4 lists the trapezoid approximations for the area under fx x 2 1 between x 0 and x 3. From the look of Figure 14-9, you might expect a trapezoid approximation to be better than a midpoint estimate, but in fact, as a general rule, midpoint estimates are about twice as good as trapezoid estimates. You can confirm this by comparing Tables 14-3 and 14-4. For instance, Table 14-3 lists an area estimate of 11.9990 for 48 midpoint rectangles. This differs from the exact area of 12 by 0.001. The area estimate with 48 trapezoids given in Table  14-4, namely 12.002, differs from 12 by twice as much. FIGURE 14-9: Three trapezoids approximate the area under fx x 2 1 between 0 and 3. 422 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series A trapezoid approximation is the average of the corresponding left-rectangle approxima- tion and the right-rectangle approximation. If you’ve already worked out the left- and right- rectangle approximations for a particular function and a certain number of rectangles, you can just average them to get the corresponding trapezoid estimate. If not, here’s the formula. The trapezoid rule: You can approximate the exact area under a curve between xa and xb, a b fx dx , with a sum of trapezoids given by the following formula. In general, the more trap- ezoids, the better the estimate. T ba n fx fx fx fx fx fxn nn2 22 22012 31..... , where n is the number of trapezoids, ba n2 is half the “height” of each sideways trapezoid, and x 0 through x n are the n 1 evenly spaced points from xa to xb. (By the way, using that half-the-height expression is completely unintuitive considering that the formula for the area of a trapezoid uses its height, not half its height. For extra credit, see if you can figure out why that b − a is divided by 2n instead of just n.) Even though the formal definition of the definite integral is based on the sum of an infinite number of rectangles, I prefer to think of integration as the limit of the trapezoid rule at infin- ity. The further you zoom in on a curve, the straighter it gets. When you use a greater and greater number of trapezoids and then zoom in on where the trapezoids touch the curve, the tops of the trapezoids get closer and closer to the curve. If you zoom in “infinitely,” the tops of the “infinitely many” trapezoids become the curve and, thus, the sum of their areas gives you the exact area under the curve. This is a good way to think about why integration produces the exact area — and it makes sense conceptually — but it’s not actually done this way. Table 14-4 Estimates of the Area Under f xx 2 1 between x 0 and x 3 Given by Increasing Numbers of Trapezoids Number of Trapezoids Area Estimate 3 6 12 24 48 96 192 384 12 5 12 125 12 031 12 008 12 002 12 0005 12 0001 12 00003 . . . . . . . . CHAPTER 14 Intro to Integration and Approximating Area 423 Simpson’s rule — that’s Thomas (1710–1761), not Homer (1987–) Now I really get fancy and draw shapes that are sort of like trapezoids except that instead of having slanting tops, they have curved, parabolic tops. See Figure 14-10. Note that with Simpson’s rule, each “trapezoid” spans two intervals instead of one; in other words, “trapezoid” 1 goes from x 0 to x 2, “trapezoid” 2 goes from x 2 to x 4, and so on. Because of this, the total span must always be divided into an even number of intervals. Simpson’s rule is by far the most accurate approximation method discussed in this chapter. In fact, it gives the exact area for any polynomial function of degree three or less. In general, Simpson’s rule gives a much better estimate than either the midpoint rule or the trapezoid rule. You can use a midpoint sum with a trapezoid sum to calculate a Simpson sum. A Simpson’s rule sum is sort of an average of a midpoint sum and a trapezoid sum, except that you use the midpoint sum twice in the average. So, if you already have the midpoint sum and the trapezoid sum for some number of rectangles/trapezoids, you can obtain the Simpson’s rule approxima- tion with the following simple average: S MM T n nn n 2 3 Note the subscript of 2n. This means that if you use, say, M 3 and T3, you get a result for S 6. But S 6, which has six intervals, has only three curvy “trapezoids” because each of them spans two intervals. Thus, this formula always involves the same number of rectangles, trapezoids, and Simpson’s rule “trapezoids.” If you don’t have the midpoint and trapezoid sums for this shortcut, you can use the following formula for Simpson’s rule. FIGURE 14-10: Three curvy-topped “trapezoids” approximate the area under gx between 1 and 4. 424 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Simpson’s rule: You can approximate the exact area under a curve between xa and xb, a b fx dx , with a sum of parabola-topped “trapezoids” given by the following formula. In gen- eral, the more “trapezoids,” the better the estimate. S ba n fx fx fx fx fx fx fn n3 42 42 401 23 41..... xx n , where n is twice the number of “trapezoids” and x 0 through x n are the n 1 evenly spaced points from xa to xb. Q. Estimate the area under fx xln from 1 to 6 with 10 trapezoids. Then compute the percent error. A. The approximate area is 5.733. The percent error is about 0.31%. 1. Sketch the function and the 10 trapezoids. You’re on your own for this sketch. 2. List the values for a, b, and n, and determine the 11 x-values, x 0 through x10 (the left edge of the first trapezoid plus the 10 right edges of the 10 trapezoids).

Compute the percent error. My calculator tells me that the exact area is 5.7505568153635. For this problem, round that off to 5.751. The relative error is given by the error divided by the exact area. Multiplying that by 100% gives you the percent error. So that gives you: relative error 5 751 5 733 5 751 0 0031 031 .. . .. % Compare this to the 10-midpoint-rectangle error you compute in the solution to Problem 2: a 0.14% error.

Estimate the area under fx xln from 1 to 6 with 10 Simpson’s rule “trapezoids.” Then compute the percent error. A. The approximate area is 5.751. The percent error is a mere 0.00069%. 1.

(Use the results from Problem 2 and the first example in this section.) To close this chapter, here’s a warning about functions that go below the x-axis. I didn’t include any such functions in this chapter, because I thought you already had enough to deal with. You see the full explanation and an example in Chapter 17. Areas below the x-axis count as negative areas. Whether approximating areas with right-, left-, or midpoint rectangles or with the trapezoid rule or Simpson’s rule, or computing exact areas with the definite integral, areas below the x-axis and above the curve count as negative areas. CHAPTER 14 Intro to Integration and Approximating Area 427 Practice Questions Answers and Explanations 1 (a) The area is 5.285. 1. Sketch a graph and divide the intervals into 10 subintervals. 2. a. Draw the “first” left rectangle by putting your pen at the left end of the first base (that’s at x 1) and going straight up till you hit the function. Whoops. You’re already on the function at x 1, right? So, guess what? For this particu- lar problem, there is no first rectangle — or you could say it’s a rectangle with a height of zero and an area of zero. 2. b. Draw the “second” rectangle by putting your pen at x 15. and going straight up till you hit f xxln ; then go right till you’re directly above x 2; and then go down to the x-axis. See the following figure. 3. Draw the rest of the rectangles. See the following figure. 428 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 4. Compute your approximation.

(b) The only difference is that the sum for left rectangles has a 0 at the left end and the sum for right rectangles has a 1.792 at the right end. The other 9 numbers in both sums are the same. Look at the second line in the computation in Step 4. Note that the sum of the 10 numbers inside the parentheses includes the first 9 numbers in the computation for right rectangles, which you see in Step 4 of the answer to the first example in this chapter. The only difference in the two sums is the left-most number in the left- rectangle sum and the right-most number in the right-rectangle sum. If you look at the figure in Step 2 of the example and at the figure in Step 3 of the solution to 1a, you can see why this works out this way. The first rectangle in the example figure is identical to the second rectangle in the solution 1a figure; the second rectangle in the example figure is identical to the third rectangle in the solution 1a figure, and so on. The only difference is that the solution 1a figure contains the left-most “rectangle” (the one with a height of zero) and the example figure contains the tall, right-most rectangle. You gotta know your right from your left. A left-rectangle sum and a right-rectangle sum will always differ by an amount equal to the difference in area of the left-most left rectangle and the right-most right rectangle. (Memorize this sentence and recite it in class — with your right index finger pointed upward for effect. You’ll instantly become a babe [dude] magnet.) 2 The approximate area is 5.759. 1. Sketch your curve and the 10 subintervals again. 2. Compute the midpoints of the bases of all rectangles. This should be a no-brainer: 1.25, 1.75, 2.25, , 5.75. 3. Draw the first rectangle. Start on the point on fx xln directly above x 125. , then go left till you’re above x 1 and right till you’re above x 15. , and then go down from both these points to make the two sides. 4. Draw the other nine rectangles. See the following figure. CHAPTER 14 Intro to Integration and Approximating Area 429 5. Compute your estimate.

These two errors cancel each other out to some extent. By the way, the exact area is about 5.751. The approximate area with 10 midpoint rectangles, 5.759, is only about 0.14% off. It’s harder to rank the left versus the right rectangle estimates. Kudos if you noticed that because of the shape of fx xln , right rectangles give a slightly better estimate (techni- cally, it’s because ln x is concave down and increasing). It turns out that the right-rectangle approximation is off by 7.48%, and the left-rectangle estimate is off by 8.10%. If you missed this question, don’t sweat it. It’s basically an extra-credit type question. 4 The approximations are, respectively, 1.974, 1.974, and 2.013. Let’s cut to the chase.

The exact area under sin x from 0 to has the wonderfully simple answer of 2. The error of the midpoint rectangle estimate is 0.65%, and the other two have an error of 1.3%. The left and right rectangle estimates are the same, by the way, because of the symmetry of the sine wave. 5 40 As often happens with many types of problems in mathematics, this very simple version of a sigma sum problem is tricky. Here, there’s no place to plug in the i values, so all the i does is work as a counter: i 1 10 4 4444444444 10 440 6 –55 10 11 11 12 1 12 34 567 02 12 22 2 222 22 222 2289 10 55 7 131,325 ii ii ii ii 1 50 2 1 50 1 50 2 1 50 32 32 3 50 50 12 50 1 6 2 50 50 1 2 131 325, 8 k k 6 12 5 or k k 1 7 55 or k k 1 7 525 9 k k 2 6 3 or k k 1 5 3 1 Did you recognize this pattern of consecutive cubes? 10 i i i 1 10 12 or i i 1 10 2 To make the terms in a sigma sum alternate between positive and negative, use a (-1) raised to a power (as you can see in the answer to problem 10). The power is usually i or i 1. CHAPTER 14 Intro to Integration and Approximating Area 431 11 The notation and approximation are 1 84 2 64 3 161 2 1 20 20 ii ii . . 1. Begin with the formula for a right sum of n rectangles using sigma notation: R gx ba n n i i n 1 2. Determine the width of each rectangle, ba n : ba n 50 20 1 4 3. Determine an expression for x i: The width of each rectangle is 1 4 , so the right edges of the 20 rectangles fall on the first 20 multiples of 1 4 . These numbers are the x-coordinates of the 20 points x1 through x 20. They can be generated by the expression 1 4 i, where i equals 1 through 20. 4. Switch out the n, the x i, and the ba n in your formula, then pull the 1 4 out to the left: R gi gi i i 20 1 1 20 20 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 5. Determine gi 1 4 , then rewrite your formula: gx xx gi ii 2 2 3 1 4 1 4 3 1 4 R ii i 20 1 20 21 4 1 4 3 1 4 6.

Express the sum of n rectangles instead of 20 rectangles. Look back at Step 5 from Problem 11. The 1 4 outside and the two 1 4 s inside come from the width of the rectangles that you got by dividing 5 (the span) by 20. So, the width of each rectangle could have been written as 5 20 . To add n rectangles instead of 20, just replace the 20 with an n — that’s 5 n . So, the three 1 4 s become 5 n . At the same time, replace the 20 on top of the with an n: R nn i n in i n55 3 5 1 2 2.

In this chapter, I calculate areas the easy way, taking advantage of one of the most important and amazing discoveries in mathematics — that integration (finding areas) is just differentiation in reverse. That reverse process was a great discovery, and it’s based on some difficult ideas, but before we get to that, let’s talk about a related, straightforward reverse process, namely . . . Antidifferentiation The derivative of sin x is cos x, so the antiderivative of cos x is sin x ; the derivative of x 3 is 3 2x , so the antiderivative of 3 2x is x 3 — you just go backwards. There’s a bit more to it, but that’s the basic idea. Later in this chapter, I show you how to find areas by using antiderivatives. This is much easier than finding areas with the Riemann sum technique. Chapter 15 IN THIS CHAPTER » Using the area function » Getting familiar with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus » Finding antiderivatives » Figuring exact areas the easy way 440 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Now consider x 3 and its derivative 3 2x again. The derivative of x 3 10 is also 3 2x , as is the derivative of x 3 5. Any function of the form xC 3 , where C is any number, has a derivative of 3 2x . So, every such function is an antiderivative of 3 2x . Definition of the indefinite integral: The indefinite integral of a function fx , written as fx dx, is the family of all antiderivatives of the function. For example, because the derivative of x 3 is 3 2x , the indefinite integral of 3 2x is xC 3 , and you write 3 23xdxx C You probably recognize this integration symbol, , from the discussion of the definite integral in Chapter 14. The definite integral symbol, however, contains two little numbers like 4 10 that tell you to compute the area under a function between those two numbers, called the limits of inte- gration. The naked version of the symbol, , indicates an indefinite integral or an antiderivative. This chapter is all about the intimate connection between these two symbols, these two ideas. Figure 15-1 shows the family of antiderivatives of 3 2x , namely xC 3 . Note that this family of curves has an infinite number of curves. They go up and down forever and are infinitely dense. The vertical gap of 2 units between each curve in Figure 15-1 is just a visual aid. Consider a few things about Figure 15-1. The top curve on the graph is y x 3 6; the one below it is y x 3 4; the bottom one is y x 3 6. By the power rule, these three functions, as well as all the others in this family of functions, have a derivative of 3 2x . Now, consider the slope of each of the curves where x equals 1 (see the tangent lines drawn on the curves). The derivative of each function is 3 2x , so when x equals 1, the slope of each curve is 31 2, or 3. Thus, all these little tangent lines are parallel. Next, notice that all the functions in Figure 15-1 are identical except for being slid up or down (remember vertical shifts from Chapter 5?). Because they differ only by a vertical shift, the steepness at any x-value, like at x 1, is the same for all the curves. FIGURE 15-1: The family of curves x C 3 . All these functions have the same derivative, 3 2x . CHAPTER 15 Integration: It’s Backwards Differentiation 441 This is the visual way to understand why each of these curves has the same derivative, and, thus, why each curve is an antiderivative of the same function. Vocabulary, Voshmabulary: What Difference Does It Make? In general, definitions and vocabulary are very important in mathematics, and it’s a good idea to use them correctly. But with the current topic, I’m going to be a bit lazy about precise ter- minology, and I hereby give you permission to do so as well. If you’re a stickler, you should say that the indefinite integral of 3 2x is xC 3 and that xC 3 is the family or set of all antiderivatives of 3 2x (you don’t say that xC 3 is the antiderivative), and you say that x 3 10, for instance, is an antiderivative of 3 2x . And on a test, you should definitely write 3 23xdxx C . If you leave the C off, you’ll likely lose some points. But, when discussing these matters, no one will care or be confused if you get tired of saying “+ C” after every indefinite integral and just say, for example, that the indefinite integral of 3 2x is x 3, and you can skip the indefinite and just say that the integral of 3 2x is x 3. And instead of always talking about that family-of-functions business, you can just say that the antiderivative of 3 2x is xC 3 or that the antiderivative of 3 2x is x 3. Everyone will know what you mean. It may cost me my membership in the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, but at least occasionally, I use this loose approach. The Annoying Area Function This is a tough one — gird your loins. Say you’ve got any old function, ft . Imagine that at some t-value, call it s, you draw a fixed vertical line. See Figure 15-2. Then you take a moveable vertical line, starting at the same point, s (“s” is for starting point), and drag it to the right. As you drag the line, you sweep out a larger and larger area under the curve. This area is a function of x, the position of the moving line. In symbols, you write Ax ft dtf s x FIGURE 15-2: The area under f between s and x is swept out by the moving line at x. 442 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Note that t is the input variable in ft instead of x because x is already taken — it’s the input variable in Axf . The subscript f in Af indicates that Axf is the area function for the par- ticular curve f or ft . The dt is a little increment along the t-axis — actually an infinitesimally small increment. Here’s a simple example to make sure you’ve got a handle on how an area function works. By the way, don’t feel bad if you find this extremely hard to grasp — you’ve got lots of company. Say you’ve got the simple function, ft 10, that’s a horizontal line at y 10. If you sweep out area beginning at s 3, you get the following area function: Ax dtf x 310 You can see that the area swept out from 3 to 4 is 10 because, in dragging the line from 3 to 4, you sweep out a rectangle with a width of 1 and a height of 10, which has an area of 1 times 10, or 10. See Figure 15-3. So, Af 4 , the area swept out as you hit 4, equals 10. Af 5 equals 20 because when you drag the line to 5, you’ve swept out a rectangle with a width of 2 and a height of 10, which has an area of 2 times 10, or 20. Af 6 equals 30, and so on. Now, imagine that you drag the line across at a rate of one unit per second. You start at x 3, and you hit 4 at 1 second, 5 at 2 seconds, 6 at 3 seconds, and so on. How much area are you sweeping out per second? Ten square units per second, because each second, you sweep out another 1-by-10 rectangle. Notice — this is huge — that because the width of each rectangle you sweep out is 1, the area of each rectangle, which is given by height times width, is the same as its height because anything times 1 equals itself. You see why this is huge in a minute. (By the way, the real rate you care about here is not area swept out per second, but, rather, area swept out per unit change on the x-axis. I explain it in terms of per second because it’s easier to think about a sweeping-out-area rate this way. And since you’re dragging the line across at one x-axis unit per one second, both rates are the same. Take your pick.) FIGURE 15-3: The area under ft 10 between 3 and x is swept out by the moving vertical line at x. CHAPTER 15 Integration: It’s Backwards Differentiation 443 The derivative of an area function equals the rate of area being swept out. Okay, are you sitting down? You’ve reached another one of the big Ah ha! moments in the history of mathematics. Recall that a derivative is a rate. So, because the rate at which the previous area function grows is 10 square units per second, you can say its derivative equals 10. Thus, you can write d dx Axf 10 Again, this just tells you that with each 1-unit increase in x, Af (the area function) goes up 10. Now here’s the critical thing: Notice that this rate or derivative of 10 is the same as the height of the original function ft 10, because as you go across 1 unit, you sweep out a rectangle that’s 1 by 10, which has an area of 10, the height of the function. And the rate works out to 10 regardless of the width of the rectangle. Imagine that you drag the vertical line from x 4 to x 4 001. . At a rate of one unit per second, that’ll take you 1/1000th of a second, and you’ll sweep out a skinny rectangle with a width of 1/1000, a height of 10, and thus an area of 10 times 1/1000, or 1/100 square units. The rate of area being swept out would therefore be 1 100 1 1000 / / square units second , which equals 10 square units per second. So, you see that with every small increment along the x-axis, the rate of area being swept out equals the function’s height. This works for any function, not just horizontal lines. Look at Figure  15-4 which shows the function gt and its area function Axg that sweeps out area beginning at s 2. Between x 36. and x 37. , Axg grows by the area of that skinny, dark-shaded “rectangle” with a width of 0.1 and a height of about 15. (As you can see, it’s not really a rectangle; it’s closer to a trapezoid, but it’s not that either, because its tiny top is curving slightly. But, in the limit, as the width gets smaller and smaller, the skinny “rectangle” behaves precisely like a real rectangle.) So, to repeat, Axg grows by the area of that dark “rectangle,” which has an area extremely close to 0.1 times 15, or 1.5. That area is swept out in 0.1 second, so the rate of area being swept out is 15 01 . . square units second , or 15 square units per second, the height of the function. This idea is so important that it deserves an icon. FIGURE 15-4: The area under gt between 2 and x is swept out by the moving vertical line at x. 444 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series The sweeping-out area rate equals the height. The rate of area being swept out under a curve by an area function at a given x-value is equal to the height of the curve at that x-value. Q. Consider ft , shown in the following figure. Given the area function Ax ft dtf x 2 , approximate Af 4 , Af 5 , Af 2 , and Af 0 . Also, is Af increasing or decreasing between x 5 and x 6? Between x 8 and x 9? Remember: When using an area function (or a definite integral — stay tuned), area below the horizontal axis counts as negative area. A. Af 4 is the area under ft between 2 and 4. That’s roughly a rectangle with a base of 2 and a height of 3, so the area is about 6. (See the shaded area in the figure.) Af 5 adds a bit to Af 4  — the added shape is roughly a trapezoid with “height” of 1 and “bases” of 2 and 3 (along the dotted lines at x 4 and x 5) that thus has an area of about 2.5 — so Af 5 is roughly 6 plus 2.5, or 8.5. Af 2 is the area between 2 and 2, which is zero. Af 0 is another area roughly in the shape of a trapezoid. Its height is 2 and its bases are 2 and 3, so its area is about 5. But because you go backward from 2 to zero, Af 0 equals about –5. Between x 5 and x 6, Af is increasing. Be careful here: ft is decreasing between 5 and 6, but as you go from 5 to 6, Af sweeps out more and more area so it’s increasing. Between x 8 and x 9, while f t is increasing, Af is decreasing. Area below the t-axis counts as negative area, so in moving from 8 to 9, Af sweeps out more and more negative area, and it thus grows more and more negative. Af is therefore decreasing. For Problems 1 through 4, use the area function Ax gt dtg x 12/ and the following figure. Most answers will be approximations. CHAPTER 15 Integration: It’s Backwards Differentiation 445 1 Where (from x 0 to x 8) does Ag equal zero? 2 Where (from x 0 to x 8) does Ag reach (a) its maximum value? (b) its minimum value? 3 In what intervals between 0 and 8 is Ag (a) increasing? (b) decreasing? 4 Approximate Ag 1 , Ag 3 , and Ag 5 . 446 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series The Power and the Glory of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Sound the trumpets! Now that you’ve seen the connection between the rate of growth of an area function and the height of the given curve, you’re ready for the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus  — what some say is one of the most important theorems in the history of mathematics. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: Given an area function Af that sweeps out area under ft , namely, Ax ft dtf s x , the rate at which area is being swept out is equal to the height of the original function. So, because the rate is the derivative, the derivative of the area function equals the original function: d dx Ax fxf Because Ax ft dtf s x , you can also write this equation as follows: d dx ft dt fx s x Break out the smelling salts. Now, because the derivative of Axf is fx , Axf is by definition an antiderivative of fx . Check out how this works by returning to the simple function from the previous section, ft 10, and its area function, Ax dtf s x10 . According to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, d dx Axf 10. Thus, Af must be an antide- rivative of 10; in other words, Af is a function whose derivative is 10. Because any function of the form 10xC , where C is a number, has a derivative of 10, the antiderivative of 10 is 10xC . The particular number C depends on your choice of s, the point where you start sweeping out area. For a particular choice of s, the area function will be the one function (out of all the functions in the family of curves 10xC ) that crosses the x-axis at s. To figure out C, set the antiderivative equal to zero, plug the value of s into x, and solve for C. For this function with an antiderivative of 10xC , if you start sweeping out area at, say, s 0, then 10 00C , so C 0, and thus, Ax dt xf x 0 10 10 0, or just 10x. (Note that C does not necessarily equal s. In fact, it usually doesn’t [especially when s 0]. When s 0, C often also equals zero, but not for all functions.) Figure 15-5 shows why Ax xf 10 is the correct area function if you start sweeping out area at zero. In the top graph in the figure, the area under the curve from 0 to 3 is 30, and that’s given by Af 3103 30. And you can see that the area from 0 to 5 is 50, which agrees with the fact that Af 5105 50. CHAPTER 15 Integration: It’s Backwards Differentiation 447 If instead you start sweeping out area at s 2 and define a new area function, B xdtf x 210 , then 10 20C , so C equals 20 and B xf is thus 10 20x . This area function is 20 more than Axf , which starts at s 0, because if you start at s 2, you’ve already swept out an area of 20 by the time you get to zero. Figure 15-5 shows why Bf 3 is 20 more than Af 3 . And if you start sweeping out area at s 3, 10 30C , so C 30 and the area function is C xdtxf x 310 10 30. This function is 30 less than Axf because with C xf , you lose the 3-by-10 rectangle between 0 and 3 that Axf has (see the bottom graph in Figure 15-5). An area function is an antiderivative. The area swept out under the horizontal line ft 10, from some number s to x, is given by an antiderivative of 10, namely 10xC , where the value of C depends on where you start sweeping out area. FIGURE 15-5: Three area functions for ft 10. 448 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Now let’s look at graphs of Axf , B xf , and C xf . (Note that Figure  15-5 doesn’t show the graphs of Axf , B xf , or C xf . You see three graphs of the horizontal line function, ft 10; and you see the areas swept out under ft by Ax Bxff,, and C xf , but you don’t actually see the graphs of these three area functions.) Check out Figure 15-6. Figure 15-6 shows the graphs of the equations of Axf , B xf , and C xf , which I worked out before: Ax xf 10 , B xxf 10 20, and C xxf 10 30. (As you can see, all three are simple, y mx b lines.) The y-values of these three functions give you the areas swept out under ft 10 that you see in Figure 15-5. Note that the three x-intercepts you see in Figure 15-6 are the three x-values in Figure 15-5 where the sweeping out of area begins. We worked out that Af 330 and that Af 550. You can see those areas of 30 and 50 in the top graph of Figure 15-5. In Figure 15-6, you see these results on Af at the points 330, and 550, . You can also see in Figure 15-5 that Bf 3 is 20 more than Af 3 ; you see that result in Figure 15-6 where 350, on Bf is 20 higher than 330, on Af . Finally, you see in Figure 15-5 that C xf is 30 less than Axf . Figure 15-6 shows that in a different way: At any x-value, the C f line is 30 units below the Af line. A few observations. You already know from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that d dx Ax fxf 10 (and the same for B xf and C xf ). That was explained a minute ago in terms of rates: For Af , Bf , and C f , the rate of area being swept out under ft 10 equals 10. Figure 15-6 also shows that d dx Axf 10 (and the same for Bf and C f ), but here you see the derivative as a slope. The slopes, of course, of all three lines equal 10. Finally, note that — like you see in Figure 15-1 — the three lines in Figure 15-6 differ from each other only by a verti- cal translation. These three lines (and the infinity of all other vertically translated lines) are all members of the class of functions, 10xC , the family of antiderivatives of fx 10. For the next example, look again at the parabola y x 2 1, our friend from Chapter 14 which we analyzed in terms of the sum of the areas of rectangles (Riemann sums). Flip back to Figure 14-4, and check out the shaded region under y x 2 1. Now you can finally compute the exact area of the shaded region the easy way. FIGURE 15-6: The actual graphs of Axf , B xf , and C xf . CHAPTER 15 Integration: It’s Backwards Differentiation 449 The area function for sweeping out area under x 2 1 is Ax tdtf s x 2 1 . By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, d dx Ax xf 2 1, and so Af is an antiderivative of x 2 1. Any function of the form 1 3 3xx C has a derivative of x 2 1 (try it), so that’s the antiderivative. For Figure 14-4, you want to sweep out area beginning at zero, so s 0. Set the antiderivative equal to zero, plug the value of s into x, and solve for C: 1 3 00 0 3 C , so C 0, and thus Ax tdtx xf x 0 231 1 3 0 The area swept out from 0 to 3 — which we do the hard way in Chapter 14 by computing the limit of a Riemann sum — is simply Af 3 : Ax xx A f f 1 3 3 1 3 33 93 12 3 3 Piece o’ cake. That was much less work than doing it the hard way. And after you know that the area function that starts at zero, 0 2 1 x tdt , equals 1 3 3xx, it’s a snap to figure the area of other sections under the parabola that don’t start at zero. Say, for example, you want the area under the parabola between 2 and 3. You can compute that area by subtracting the area between 0 and 2 from the area between 0 and 3. We just figured the area between 0 and 3 — that’s 12. And the area between 0 and 2 is Af 2 1 3 22 4 2 3 3 . So, the area between 2 and 3 is 12 4 2 3 , or 7 1 3 . This subtraction method brings us to the next topic — the second version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: Take Two Now you finally arrive at the super-duper shortcut integration theorem that you’ll use for the rest of your natural born days — or at least till the end of your stint with calculus. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (second version or shortcut version): Let F be any anti- derivative of the function f; then a b fx dx Fb Fa This theorem gives you the super shortcut for computing a definite integral like 2 3 2 1xdx, the area under the parabola y x 2 1 between 2 and 3. As I show in the previous section, you 450 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series can get this area by subtracting the area between 0 and 2 from the area between 0 and 3, but to do that, you need to know that the particular area function sweeping out area beginning at zero, 0 2 1 x tdt , is 1 3 3xx; and to get that, you need to calculate that the value of C is zero. The beauty of the shortcut theorem is that you don’t have to even use an area function like Ax tdtf x 0 2 1 . You just find any antiderivative, Fx , of your function, and do the subtrac- tion, Fb Fa . The simplest antiderivative to use is the one where C 0. So, here’s how you use the theorem to find the area under our parabola from 2 to 3. You begin with the simplest antiderivative of x 2 1; that’s Fx xx 1 3 3 . Then the theorem gives you: 2 3 2 13 2xdxF F FF xx32 1 3 3 2 3 can be written as and thus,, 2 3 23 2 3 33 1 1 3 1 3 33 1 3 22 12 4 2 3 7 1 3 xdxx x Granted, this is the same computation I did in the previous section using the area function with s 0, but that’s only because for the y x 2 1 function, when s is zero, C is also zero. It’s sort of a coincidence, and it’s not true for all functions. But regardless of the function, the shortcut works, and you don’t have to worry about area functions or s or C. All you do is Fb Fa . Here’s another problem: What’s the area under fx e x between x 3 and x 5? The deriva- tive of e x is e x, so e x is an antiderivative of e x, and thus 3 5 3 5 53 148 4201 128 3 edxe ee xx .. . What could be simpler? Areas above the curve and below the x-axis count as negative areas. Before going on, I’d be remiss if I didn’t touch on negative areas (this is virtually the same caution made at the very end of Chapter  14). Note that with the two examples, the parabola, y x 2 1, and the expo- nential function, y e x , the areas you’re computing are under the curves and above the x-axis. These areas count as ordinary, positive areas. But, if a function goes below the x-axis, areas above the curve and below the x-axis count as negative areas. This is the case whether you’re using an area function, the first version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, or the short- cut version. Don’t worry about this for now. You see how this works in Chapter 17. CHAPTER 15 Integration: It’s Backwards Differentiation 451 Okay, so now you’ve got the super shortcut for computing the area under a curve. And if one big shortcut wasn’t enough to make your day, Table 15-1 lists some rules about definite integrals that can make your life much easier. Table 15-1 Five Easy Rules for Definite Integrals 1) 0 (Well, duh — there’s no area “between” and .) 2) 3) 4) ( is a constant; you can pull a constant out of the integral.) 5) a a ab b a b cb a ac bb aa b b b a a a f x dx a a f x dx f x dx f x dx f x dx f x dx kf x dx k f x dx k f x g x dx f x dx g x dx Q. (a) For the area function, Ax tt dtf x 10 2 5 , what’s d dx Axf ? (b) For the area function, B xt dtf x sin 4 3 2 , what’s d dx Bxf ? A. (a) No work needed here. The answer is simply x x 2 5 by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. (b) sin63 2xx . The argument of an area function is the expression at the top of the integral symbol — not the integrand. Because the argument of this area function, 3 2x , is something other than a plain old x, this is a chain rule problem. Thus, d dx Bx xxf sin3 6 2 , or 6 3 2xxsin Q. What’s the area under 2 5 2x from 0 to 4? Note: this is the same question that you work on in Chapter 10 with the difficult sigma-sum-rectangle method. A. 188 3 452 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Using the second version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, 0 4 225 40xdxF F , where F is any antiderivative of 2 5 2x . Anything of the form 2 3 5 3xx C is an antiderivative of 2 5 2x . You should use the simplest antiderivative where C 0, namely, 2 3 5 3xx. Thus, 0 4 23 0 4 33 25 2 3 5 2 3 45 4 2 3 05 0 188 3 xdxx x You get the same answer with much less work than adding up all those rectangles! 5 6 Given that Ax tdtf x sin / cos 4 , find d dx Axf .

But that doesn’t mean you’re off the hook. Following are three different ways to understand why the shortcut version of the theorem works. This is difficult stuff — brace yourself. Alternatively, you can skip these explanations if all you want to know is how to compute an area: Forget about C and just subtract Fa from Fb . I include these explanations because I suspect you’re dying to learn extra math just for the love of learning — right? Other books just give you the rules; I explain why they work and the underlying principles — that’s why they pay me the big bucks. Actually, in all seriousness, you should read at least some of this material. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is one of the most important theorems in all of mathematics, so you ought to spend some time trying hard to understand what it’s all about. It’s worth the effort. Of the three explanations, the first is the easiest. But if you only want to read one or two of the three, I’d read just the third, or the second and the third. Or, you could begin with the figures accom- panying the three explanations, because the figures really show you what’s going on. Finally, if you can’t digest all of this in one sitting — no worries — you can revisit it later. Why the theorem works: Area functions explained One way to understand the shortcut version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is by looking at area functions. As you can see in Figure 15-7, the dark-shaded area between a and b can be figured by starting with the area between s and b, then cutting away (subtracting) the area between s and a. And it doesn’t matter whether you use 0 as the left edge of the areas or any other value of s. Do you see that you’d get the same result whether you use the graph on the left or the graph on the right? Take a look at ft 10 (see Figure  15-8). Say you want the area between 5 and 8 under the horizontal line ft 10, and you are forced to use calculus. FIGURE 15-7: Figuring the area between a and b with two different area functions. CHAPTER 15 Integration: It’s Backwards Differentiation 455 Look back at two of the area functions for ft 10 in Figure  15-5: Axf starting at zero (in which C 0) and B xf starting at 220 where()C : Ax dt x B xdtx f x f x 0 2 10 10 10 10 20 If you use Axf to compute the area between 5 and 8 in Figure 15-8, you get the following: 5 810 85 10 8105 80 50 dx AAff (80 is the area of the rrectangle from 0 to 8; 50 is the area of the rectangle fromm 0 to 5.) 30 If, on the other hand, you use B xf to compute the same area, you get the same result: 5 810 85 10 820105 20 80 20 50 20 dx BAff (This iss 100 of course; 100 is the area of the rectangle from 70, 22to 8; 70 is the area of the rectangle from 2to 5.) 30 Notice that the two 20’s in the second line from the bottom cancel. Recall that all antiderivatives of ft 10 are of the form 10xC . Regardless of the value of C, it cancels out as in this example. Thus, you can use any antiderivative with any value of C. For convenience, everyone just uses the antiderivative with C 0, so that you don’t mess with C at all. And the choice of s (the point where the area function begins) is irrelevant. So, when you’re using the shortcut version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and computing an area with Fb Fa , you’re sort of using a mystery area function with a C value of zero and an unknown starting point, s (recall that when C is zero, s might or might not be zero.). Get it? FIGURE 15-8: The shaded area equals 30 — well, duh, it’s a 3-by-10 rectangle. 456 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Why the theorem works: The integration- differentiation connection The next explanation of the shortcut version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus involves the yin/yang relationship between differentiation and integration. Check out Figure 15-9. The figure shows a function, fx xx 2 , and its derivative, fx x21. Look carefully at the numbers 4, 6, and 8 on both graphs. The connection between 4, 6, and 8 on the graph of f — which are the amounts of rise between consecutive points on the curve — and 4, 6, and 8 on the graph of f  — which are the areas of the trapezoids under f  — shows the intimate relationship between integration and differentiation. Figure 15-9 is a picture worth a thousand symbols and equations, encapsulating the essence of integration in a single snapshot. It shows how the shortcut version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus works because it shows that the area under fx between 1 and 4 equals the total rise on fx between 12, and 420, , in other words that 1 4 41fx ff Note that I’ve called the two functions in Figure 15-9 and in this equation f and f to emphasize that 2 1x is the derivative of xx 2 . I could have instead referred to xx 2 as F and referred to 2 1x as f, which would emphasize that xx 2 is an antiderivative of 2 1x . In that case, you would write this area equation in the standard way, 1 4 41fx dx FF Either way, the meaning’s the same. I use the derivative version to point out how finding area is differentiation in reverse. Going from left to right in Figure 15-9 is differentiation: The slopes of f correspond to heights on f . Going from right to left is integration: Areas under f corre- spond to the change in height between two points on f. FIGURE 15-9: The essence of differentiation and integration in a single figure! It’s a yin/yang thing. CHAPTER 15 Integration: It’s Backwards Differentiation 457 Okay, here’s how it works. Imagine you’re going up along f from 12, to 26, . Every point along the way has a certain steepness, a slope. This slope is plotted as the y-coordinate, or height, on the graph of f . The fact that f goes up from 13, to 25, tells you that the slope of f goes up from 3 to 5 as you travel between 12, and 26, . This all follows from basic differentiation. Now, as you go along f from 12, to 26, , the slope is constantly changing. But it turns out that because you go up a total rise of 4 as you run across 1, the average of all the slopes on f between 12, and 26, is 4 1 , or 4. Because each of these slopes is plotted as a y-coordinate or height on f , it follows that the average height of f between 13, and 25, is also 4. Thus, between two given points, average slope on f equals average height on f . Hold on, you’re almost there. Slope equals rise run , so when the run is 1, the slope equals the rise. For example, from 12, to 26, on f, the curve rises up 4 and the average slope between those points is also 4. Thus, between any two points on f whose x-coordinates differ by 1, the average slope is the rise. The area of a trapezoid like the ones on the right in Figure 15-9 equals its width times its aver- age height. (This is true of any other similar shape that has a bottom like a rectangle; the top can be any crooked line or funky curve you like.) So, because the width of each trapezoid is 1, and because anything times 1 is itself, the average height of each trapezoid under f is its area; for instance, the area of that first trapezoid is 4 and its average height is also 4. Are you ready for the grand finale? Here’s the whole argument in a nutshell. On f, riseaverageslope; going from f to f , averageslope averageheight; on f , averageheightarea. So that gives you riseslope height area, and thus, finally, risearea. And that’s what the second version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says: fb fa fx dx rise area a b These ideas are unavoidably difficult. You might have to read it two or three times for it to really sink in. Notice that it makes no difference to the relationship between slope and area if you use any other function of the form xx C 2 instead of xx 2 . Any parabola like xx 2 10 or xx 2 5 is exactly the same shape as xx 2 ; it’s just been slid up or down vertically. Any such parabola rises up between x 1 and x 4 in precisely the same way as the parabola in Figure 15-9. From 1 to 2 these parabolas go over 1, up 4. From 2 to 3 they go over 1, up 6, and so on. This is why any antiderivative can be used to find area. The total area under f between 1 to 4, namely 18, corresponds to the total rise on any of these parabolas from 1 to 4, namely 4 68, or 18. At the risk of beating a dead horse, I’ve got a third explanation of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for you. You might prefer it to the first two because it’s less abstract — it’s connected to simple, commonsense ideas encountered in our day-to-day world. This explanation has a lot in common with the previous one, but the ideas are presented from a different angle. 458 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Why the theorem works: A connection to — egad! — statistics Don’t let the title of this section put you off. I realize that many readers of this calculus book may not have studied statistics. No worries; the statistics connection I explain here involves a very simple thing covered in statistics courses, but you don’t need to know any statistics at all to understand this idea. The simple idea is the relationship between a frequency distribution graph and a cumulative frequency distribution graph (you might have run across such graphs in a newspaper or magazine). Consider Figure 15-10. The upper graph in the figure shows a frequency distribution histogram of the annual profits of Widgets-R-Us from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2013. The rectangle marked ’07, for example, shows that the company’s profit for 2007 was $2,000,000 (their best year during the period 2001–2013). The lower graph in the figure is a cumulative frequency distribution histogram for the same data used for the upper graph. The difference is simply that in the cumulative graph, the height of each column shows the total profits earned since 1/1/2001. Look at the ’02 column in the lower graph and the ’01 and ’02 rectangles in the upper graph, for example. You can see that the ’02 column shows the ’02 rectangle sitting on top of the ’01 rectangle, which gives that ’02 column a height equal to the total of the profits from ’01 and ’02. Got it? As you go to the right on the cumulative graph, the height of each successive column simply grows by the amount of profits earned in the corresponding single year shown in the upper graph. Okay. So, here’s the calculus connection. (Bear with me; it takes a while to walk through all this.) Look at the top rectangle of the ’08 column on the cumulative graph (let’s call that graph C for short). At that point on C, you run across 1 year and rise up $1,250,000, the ’08 profit you see on the frequency distribution graph (F for short). Slope rise run/, so, since the run equals 1, the slope equals 1,250,000/1, or just 1,250,000, which is, of course, the same as the rise. Thus, the slope on C (at ’08 or any other year) can be read as a height on F for the corresponding year. (Make sure you see how this works.) Since the heights (or function values) on F are the slopes of C, F is the derivative of C. In short, F, the derivative, tells you about the slope of C. The next idea is that since F is the derivative of C, C, by definition, is the antiderivative of F (for example, C might equal 5 3x and F would equal 15 2x ). Now, what does C, the antiderivative of F, tell you about F ? Imagine dragging a vertical line from left to right over F. As you sweep over the rectangles on F — year by year — the total profit you’re sweeping over is shown climbing up along C. Look at the ’01 through ’08 rectangles on F. You can see those same rectangles climbing up stair-step fashion along C (see the rectangles labeled A, B, C, and so on, on both graphs). The heights of the rectangles from F keep adding up on C as you climb up the stair-step shape. And I’ve shown how the same ’01 through ’08 rectangles that lie along the stair-step top of C can also be seen in a vertical stack at year ’08 on C. I’ve drawn the cumulative graph this way so it’s even more obvious how the heights of the rectangles add up. (Note: Most cumulative histo- grams are not drawn this way.) CHAPTER 15 Integration: It’s Backwards Differentiation 459 Each rectangle on F has a base of 1 year, so, since areabaseheight , the area of each rectan- gle equals its height. So, as you stack up rectangles on C, you’re adding up the areas of those rectangles from F. For example, the height of the ’01 through ’08 stack of rectangles on C ($8.5 million) equals the total area of the ’01 through ’08 rectangles on F. And, therefore, the heights or function values of C — which is the antiderivative of F — give you the area under the top edge of F. That’s how integration works. Okay, we’re just about done. Now let’s go through how these two graphs explain the shortcut version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the relationship between differentiation and integration. Look at the ’06 through ’12 rectangles on F (with the bold border). You can see FIGURE 15-10: A frequency distribution histogram (above) and a cumulative frequency distribution histogram (below) for the annual profits of Widgets-R-Us show the connection between differentiation and integration. 460 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series those same rectangles in the bold portion of the ’12 column of C. The height of that bold stack, which shows the total profits made during those 7 years, $7.75 million, equals the total area of the 7 rectangles in F. And to get the height of that stack on C, you simply subtract the height of the stack’s bottom edge from the height of its upper edge. That’s really all the shortcut version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says: The area under any portion of a function (like F) is given by the change in height on the function’s antiderivative (like C). In a nutshell (keep looking at those rectangles with the bold border in both graphs), the slopes of the rectangles on C appear as heights on F. That’s differentiation. Reversing direction, you see integration: The change in heights on C shows the area under F. Voilà: Differentiation and inte- gration are two sides of the same coin. (Note: Mathematical purists may object to this explanation of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus because it involves discrete graphs [for example, the fact that the cumulative distri- bution histogram in Figure  15-10 goes up at one-year increments], whereas calculus is the study of smooth, continuously changing graphs [the calculus version of the cumulative dis- tribution histogram would be a smooth curve that would show the total profits growing every millisecond — actually, in theory, every infinitesimal fraction of a second]. Okay — objection noted — but the fact is that the explanation here does accurately show how integration and differentiation are related and does correctly show how the shortcut version of the Fundamen- tal Theorem of Calculus works. All that’s needed to turn Figure 15-10 and the accompanying explanation into standard calculus is to take everything to the limit, making the profit interval shorter and shorter and shorter: from a year to a month to a day, and so on. In the limit, the discrete graphs in Figure 15-10 would meld into the type of smooth graphs used in calculus. But the ideas wouldn’t change. The ideas would be exactly as explained here. This is very similar to what you see in Chapter 14 where you first approximate the area under a curve by adding up the areas of rectangles and then are able to compute the exact area by using the limit process to narrow the widths of the rectangles till their widths become infinitesimal.) Well, there you have it — actual explanations of why the shortcut version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus works and why finding area is differentiation in reverse. If you under- stand only half of what I’ve just written, you’re way ahead of most students of calculus. The good news is that you probably won’t be tested on this theoretical stuff. Now let’s come back down to earth. Finding Antiderivatives: Three Basic Techniques I’ve been talking a lot about antiderivatives, but just how do you find them? In this section, I give you three easy techniques. Then, in Chapter 16, I give you four advanced techniques. By the way, you will be tested on this stuff. Reverse rules for antiderivatives The easiest antiderivative rules are the ones that are the reverse of derivative rules you already know. (You can brush up on derivative rules in Chapter 10 if you need to.) These are automatic, CHAPTER 15 Integration: It’s Backwards Differentiation 461 one-step antiderivatives with the exception of the reverse power rule, which is only slightly harder. No-brainer reverse rules You know that the derivative of sin x is cos x, so reversing that tells you that an antiderivative of cos x is sin x. What could be simpler? But don’t forget that all functions of the form sin xC are antiderivatives of cos x. In symbols, you write d dx xx xdxx C sincos , cossin and therefore Table 15-2 lists the reverse rules for antiderivatives.

Use y x5 4 for your function. Recall that the power rule says to do the following: 1.

Reduce the power by one and simplify. 4 54 520 43 3xx x Thus, y x20 3. To reverse this process, you reverse the order of the two steps and reverse the math within each step.

The reverse power rule does not work for a power of negative one. The reverse power rule works for all powers (including negative and decimal powers) except for a power of negative one. Instead of using the reverse power rule, you should just memorize that the antiderivative of x 1 is ln xC (rule 3 in Table 15-2). Test your antiderivatives by differentiating them. Especially when you’re new to antidifferen- tiation, it’s a good idea to test your antiderivatives by differentiating them — you can ignore the C. If you get back to your original function, you know your antiderivative is correct. With the antiderivative you just found and the shortcut version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, you can determine the area under 20 3x between, say, 1 and 2: 20 5 20 5 52 51 80 575 34 1 2 34 1 2 44 xdxx C xdxx ,thus 13 What’s dx x16 2 ? 14 What’s 50xdxx ( )? CHAPTER 15 Integration: It’s Backwards Differentiation 463 Guessing and checking The guess-and-check method works when the integrand (that’s the expression after the inte- gral symbol not counting the dx, and it’s the thing you want to antidifferentiate) is close to a function that you know the reverse rule for. For example, say you want the antiderivative of cos 2x . Well, you know that the derivative of sine is cosine. Reversing that tells you that the antiderivative of cosine is sine. So you might think that the antiderivative of cos 2x is sin 2x . That’s your guess. Now check it by differentiating it to see if you get the original func- tion, cos 2x : d dx x xx sin (sine rule and chain rule) 2 22 22 cos cos This result is very close to the original function, except for that extra coefficient of 2. In other words, the answer is 2 times as much as what you want. Because you want a result that’s half of this, just try an antiderivative that’s half of your first guess: So, your new guess is 1 2 2sin x . Check this second guess by differentiating it, and you get the desired result. Here’s another problem. What’s the antiderivative of 32 4x ? 1. Guess the antiderivative. This looks sort of like a power rule problem, so try the reverse power rule. The antide- rivative of x 4 is 1 5 5x by the reverse power rule, so your guess is 1 5 32 5x . 2. Check your guess by differentiating it. d dx x x 1 5 32 5 1 5 32 3 5 4 (power rule and chain rulee) 33 2 4x 3. Tweak your first guess. Your result, 33 2 4x , is three times too much, so make your second guess a third of your first guess — that’s 1 3 1 5 32 5x , or 1 15 32 5x . 4. Check your second guess by differentiating it. d dx x x 1 15 32 5 1 15 32 3 5 4 (power rule and chain rulle) 32 4x This checks. You’re done. The antiderivative of 32 4x is 1 15 32 5xC . 464 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series The two previous problems show that guess and check works well when the function you want to antidifferentiate has an argument like 3x or 32x (where x is raised to the first power) instead of a plain old x. (Recall that in a function like 5x , the 5x is called the argument.) In this case, all you have to do is tweak your guess by the reciprocal of the coefficient of x: for example, the 3 in 32x (the 2 in 32x has no effect on your answer). In fact, for these easy problems, you don’t really have to do any guessing and checking. You can immediately see how to tweak your guess. It becomes sort of a one-step process. If the function’s argument is more complicated than 32x  — like the x 2 in cos x 2  — you have to try the next method, substitution. 15 Determine 41 3xdx. 16 What’s sec 2 6xdx ? 17 Determine cos x dx 1 2 . 18 What’s 3 25 dt t ? 19 Compute the definite integral, 0 5 55sectantt dt. 20 Find 45 19 2 . x dx. CHAPTER 15 Integration: It’s Backwards Differentiation 465 The substitution method If you look back at the examples of the guess-and-check method in the previous section, you can see why the first guess in each case didn’t work. When you differentiate the guess, the chain rule produces an extra constant: 2 in the first example, 3 in the second. You then tweak the guesses with 1 2 and 1 3 to compensate for the extra constant. Now say you want the antiderivative of cos x 2 and you guess that it is sin x 2 . Watch what happens when you differentiate sin x 2 to check it: d dx x xx xx (sine rule and chain rule) sin cos cos 2 2 2 2 22 Here the chain rule produces an extra 2x — because the derivative of x 2 is 2x — but if you try to compensate for this by attaching a 1 2x to your guess, it won’t work. Try it. So, guessing and checking doesn’t work for antidifferentiating cos x 2  — actually, no method works for this simple-looking integrand (not all functions have antiderivatives)  — but your admirable attempt at differentiation here reveals a new class of functions that you can anti- differentiate. Because the derivative of sin x 2 is 2 2xxcos , the antiderivative of 2 2xxcos must be sin x 2 . This function, 2 2xxcos , is the type of function you can antidifferentiate with the substitution method. Keep your eyes peeled for the derivative of the function’s argument. The substitution method works when the integrand contains a function and the derivative of the function’s argument — in other words, when it contains that extra thing produced by the chain rule — or something just like it except for a constant. And the integrand must not contain any other extra stuff. The derivative of e x 3 is e x x 3 3 2 by the e x rule and the chain rule. So, the antiderivative of e x x 3 3 2 is e x 3 . And if you were asked to find the antiderivative of e x x 3 3 2, you would know that the substitution method would work because this expression contains 3 2x , which is the deriva- tive of the argument of e x 3 , namely x 3. By now, you’re probably wondering why this is called the substitution method. I show you why in the following step-by-step method. But first, I want to point out that you don’t always have to use the step-by-step method. Assuming you understand why the antiderivative of e x x 3 3 2 is e x 3 , you may encounter problems where you can just see the antiderivative without doing any work. But whether or not you can just see the answers to problems like that one, the substitu- tion method is a good technique to learn because, for one thing, it has many uses in calculus and other areas of mathematics, and for another, your teacher may require that you know it and use it. 466 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Okay, so here’s how to find 2 2xx dxcos with substitution: 1. Set u equal to the argument of the main function. The argument of cos x 2 is x 2, so you set u equal to x 2. 2. Take the derivative of u with respect to x. u x du dx x 2 2 so 3. Solve for dx. du dx x du xdx du x dx 2 1 2 2 (cross multiplication) (dividing botth sides by2x ) 4. Make the substitutions. In 2 2xx dxcos , u takes the place of x 2 and du x2 takes the place of dx. So now you’ve got 2 2 xu du x cos . The two 2x’s cancel, giving you cosudu. 5. Antidifferentiate using the simple reverse rule. cossinuduu C 6. Substitute x 2 back in for u, coming full circle. u equals x 2, so x 2 goes in for the u: cossinudux C 2 That’s it. So 2 22xx dx xCcossin . If the original problem had been 5 2xx dxcos instead of 2 2xx dxcos , you would follow the same steps except that in Step 4, after making the substitution, you would arrive at 5 2 xu du x cos . The x’s would still cancel  — that’s the important thing  — but after canceling, you would get 5 2 cos udu, which has that extra 5 2 in it. No worries. You would just pull the 5 2 through the symbol, giving you 5 2 cos udu. Now you would finish this problem just as you did in Steps 5 and 6, except for the extra 5 2: 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 2 cossin sin sin uduu C uC xC Because C is any old constant, 5 2 C is still any old constant, so you can get rid of the 5 2 in front of the C . That may seem somewhat (grossly?) unmathematical, but it’s right. Thus, your final answer is 5 2 2sin xC . You should check this by differentiating it. CHAPTER 15 Integration: It’s Backwards Differentiation 467 Here are a few examples of antiderivatives you can do with the substitution method so you can learn how to spot them: » 4 23xx dxcos The derivative of x 3 is 3 2x , but you don’t have to pay any attention to the 3 in 3 2x or the 4 in the integrand. Because the integrand contains x 2 and no other extra stuff, substitution works. Try it. » 10 2sec tanxe dx x The integrand contains a function, e xtan , and the derivative of its argument (tan)x  — which is sec 2 x . Because the integrand doesn’t contain any other extra stuff (except for the 10, which doesn’t matter), substitution works. Do it. » 2 3 cossinxx dx Because the integrand contains the derivative of sin ,x namely cos ,x and no other stuff except for the 2 3 , substitution works. Go for it. You can do the three problems just listed with a method that combines substitution and guess- and-check (as long as your teacher doesn’t insist that you show the six-step substitution solu- tion). Try using this combo method to antidifferentiate the first example, 4 23xx dxcos . First, you confirm that the integral fits the pattern for substitution — it does, as pointed out in the first item on the checklist. This confirmation is the only part substitution plays in the combo method. Now you finish the problem with the guess-and-check method: Q. Find 4 23xx dxcos . A. 4 3 3sin x 1. Make your guess. The antiderivative of cosine is sine, so a good guess for the antiderivative of 4 23xxcos is sin x 3 . 2. Check your guess by differentiating it. d dx xx x xx sincos cos 33 2 23 3 3 (sine rule and chain rule) 3. Tweak your guess. Your result from Step 2, 3 23xxcos , is 3 4 of what you want, 4 23xxcos , so make your guess 4 3 bigger (note that 4 3 is the reciprocal of 3 4 ). Your second guess is thus 4 3 3sin x . 4. Check this second guess by differentiating it. Oh, heck, skip this — your answer’s got to work. 468 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 21 Find the antiderivative, sin cos x x dx, with the substitution method. 22 Find the antiderivative, xx dx 453 26 , with the substitution method. 23 Use substitution to determine 5 3 4 xe dx x . 24 Use substitution to determine sec 2 x x dx. CHAPTER 15 Integration: It’s Backwards Differentiation 469 Finding Area with Substitution Problems You can use the shortcut version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to calculate the area under a function that you integrate with the substitution method. You can do this in two ways. In the previous section, I use substitution, setting u equal to x 2, to find the antiderivative of 2 2xxcos : 2 22xx dx xCcossin If you want the area under this curve from, say, 0.5 to 1, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus does the trick: 0 5 1 22 05 1 22 2 10 5 1 . .cossin sinsin . sinsi xx dx x nn. .. . 025 0 841 0 247 0 594 Another method, which amounts to the same thing, is to change the limits of integration and do the whole problem in terms of u. Refer back to the six-step solution in the section “The substi- tution method.” What follows is very similar, except that this time you’re doing definite inte- gration rather than indefinite integration. Again, you want the area given by 0 5 1 22 . cosxx dx : 1. Set u equal to x 2. 2. Take the derivative of u with respect to x. du dx x2 3.

CHAPTER 15 Integration: It’s Backwards Differentiation 471 Practice Questions Answers and Explanations 1 At about x 2 or 2 1 2 and about x 6. Ag equals zero twice between x 0 and x 8. First, somewhere between x 2 and x 2 1 2 , where the negative area beginning at x 1 cancels out the positive area between x 1 2 and x 1. The second zero of Ag is somewhere between x 5 1 2 and x 6. After the first zero at about x 2 1 4 , negative area is added between 2 1 4 and 4. The positive area from 4 to, say, 5 3 4 roughly cancels that out, so Ag returns to zero at about x 5 3 4 . 2 (a) Ag reaches its max at about x 8. After the zero at about x 5 3 4 , Ag grows by roughly 3 1 4 square units by the time x gets to 8. (b) The minimum value of Ag is at x 4, where it equals something like 1 1 2 . Note that this minimum occurs at the point where all the negative area has been added (minimums often occur at points like that), and that when you move to the right past x 4, the area crosses above the t-axis and the area begins to increase. 3 (a) Ag is increasing from 0 to 1 and from 4 to 8. (b) Ag is decreasing from 1 to 4. 4 Ag 1 is slightly more than 1; Ag 3 is about 1; Ag (5) is also about 1. Ag 1 is a bit bigger than the right triangle with base from x 1 2 to x 1 on the t-axis and with vertex maybe at 1 2 4, , which has an area of 1. So the area in question is slightly more than 1. There’s a zero at about 2 1 4 . Between there and x 3, the area is very roughly –1, so Ag 3 is about –1. In Problem 2b, you estimate Ag 4 to be about 1 1 2. Between 4 and 5, there’s sort of a trian- gular shape with a rough area of 1 2. Thus Ag 5 equals about 1 1 2 1 2 or roughly –1. 5 (a) d dx Ax xf sin (b) d dx Ax xg sin 6 The answer is sinsin cosxx .

(I’m a poet!) This “poem” always works. Try it for the other problems. Often what you want is a 1. For example, for Problem 15, you’d have, “You wanted a 1 but you got 1 2, so tweak your guess by 1 over 1 2.” That’s 2, of course. It works! Back to Problem 18. Your tweaked guess is 3 2 25ln t .

Differentiate and solve for du. du dx x dux dx sin sin Shortcut for the u-substitution integration method. You can save a little time in all substitution problems by just solving for du — as I did here — and not bothering to solve for dx. You then tweak the expression inside the integral so that it contains the thing du equals and compensate for that tweaking by adding something outside the integral. In the current problem, du equals sin xdx. The integral contains a sin xdx, so you multiply it by 1 to turn it into sin xdx and then compensate for that 1 by multiplying the whole integral by 1. This is a wash because 1 times 1 equals 1. This may not sound like much of a shortcut, but it’s a good time-saver once you get used to it. (Solving for dx is the book and classroom method, and that’s why I went through that method in the text. But I like to use this tip. Either way is fine.

That shape looks sort of like a right triangle with a curvy “hypotenuse.” If it were exactly a right triangle (with a base of 2 and a height that looks very close to 1.5), its area would be 1.5. Add a bit because of the curvy hypotenuse. (b) About 2.5. Ag 1 concerns the area above g and below the x-axis between 1 and 4. That sort-of semi- circle looks like it has an area of about 2.5. Since that area is below the x-axis, it counts as negative area, and so, your answer would be about –2.5 if you were asked for the area from 1 to 4. However, Ag 1 asks for the area from 4 to 1 (which is going backwards). Rule 2 from Table 15-1 tells you that the area from 4 to 1 is the opposite of the area from 1 to 4. Thus, your answer is the opposite of roughly –2.5, or, of course, roughly 2.5. 2 e x3 The input of any area function is the upper index of integration. So, for Ax tdtf e e x 2 , the input is e x. Because the input of this function is not just a simple x, determining the deriva- tive d dx Axf is a chain rule problem. If the upper index had been just x, the derivative would equal x 2 by the fundamental theorem. So, because this is a chain rule problem, you replace the x with e x, then multiply by the derivative of e x (which is e x). So, that gives you ee ee e xx xx x2 23 . 3 2 csccot cotcot 2 4 34 4 34 3 44 11 2 xdxx 4 cos xC Be careful about negative signs when differentiating or integrating sines and cosines, and don’t forget the C! 5 5 25 25 xC xC or 5 Rewrite 2 35 x dx with a power rather than a radical, then use the reverse power rule: 2 2 2 2 5 5 35 35 25 25 x dx xdx xC xC 6 1 5 58 5 xC Guess-and-check is a good method for this one. 478 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 7 eC x This is another problem where guess-and-check works well. 8 eC x1 e x dx x1 2 let u x du x dx 1 1 2 Now rewrite the integrand in terms of u, solve, and switch back to x: e x dx e x dx edue Ce C xx uu x 1 2 1 2 1 9 3 3sin xC cos x x dx 3 23 let ux du xdx x dx 3 23 23 1 3 1 3 Rewrite the integrand in terms of u, solve, and switch back to x: coscos cossin sin x x dx x x dx uduu Cx C 3 23 3 23 33 3 33 3 10 sin.10 84147 cosln x x dx e 1 let ux du x dx ln 1 when when xu xe u 10 1 , , cosln cossin sinsin sin x x dx uduu e 10 1 0 1 10 1 CHAPTER 16 Integration Techniques for Experts 479 Integration Techniques for Experts I figure it wouldn’t hurt to give you a break from the kind of theoretical groundwork stuff that I lay on pretty thick in Chapter  15, so this chapter cuts to the chase and shows you just the nuts and bolts of several integration techniques. In Chapter 15, you saw three basic integration methods: the reverse rules, the guess-and-check method, and substitution. Now you graduate to four advanced techniques: integration by parts, trigonometric integrals, trigonometric substitution, and partial fractions. Ready? Integration by Parts: Divide and Conquer Integrating by parts is the integration version of the product rule for differentiation. Just take my word for it. The basic idea of integration by parts is to transform an integral you can’t do into a simple product minus an integral you can do. Here’s the formula: Integration-by-parts formula: udvuvvdu And here’s a memory aid for it: In the first two chunks, udv and uv, the u and v are in alpha- betical order. If you remember that, you can remember that the integral on the right is just like the one on the left, except the u and v are reversed. Chapter 16 IN THIS CHAPTER » Breaking down integrals into parts and finding trigonometric integrals » Returning to your roots with SohCahToa » Understanding the As, Bs, and Cs of partial fractions » Looking at LIATE 480 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Don’t try to understand the formula yet. You’ll see how it works in a minute. And don’t worry about understanding the first example coming up until you get to the end of it. The integra- tion-by-parts process may seem pretty convoluted your first time through it, so you’ve got to be patient. After you work through a couple examples, you’ll see it’s really not that bad at all. The integration-by-parts box: The integration-by-parts formula contains four things: u, v, du, and dv. To help keep everything straight, organize your problems with a box like the one in Figure 16-1. Let’s do xx dxln to see how this method works. The integration-by-parts formula converts this integral, which you can’t do directly, into a simple product minus an integral you know how to do. First, you’ve got to split up the integrand into two chunks — one chunk becomes the u and the other the dv that you see on the left side of the formula. For this problem, the ln x becomes your u chunk. Then everything else is the dv chunk, namely xdx . ( In the next section, I show you how to decide what goes into the u chunk; then, whatever is left over is automati- cally the dv chunk.) After rewriting the integrand, you’ve got the following for the left side of the formula: Now it’s time to do the box thing. For each new problem, you should draw an empty four- square box, then put your u (ln x in this problem) in the upper-left square and your dv ( xdx in this problem) in the lower-right square. See Figure 16-2. Next, you differentiate u to get your du, and you integrate dv to get your v. The arrows in Figure 16-2 remind you to differentiate on the left and to integrate on the right. Think of dif- ferentiation — the easier thing — as going down (like going downhill), and integration — the harder thing — as going up (like going uphill). FIGURE 16-1: The integration- by-parts box. FIGURE 16-2: Filling in the box. CHAPTER 16 Integration Techniques for Experts 481 Now complete the box: ux du dx x du x dx ln 1 1 dv xdx dv xdx vx 2 3 32/ (reverse power rule; note that you ddrop the C ) Figure 16-3 shows the completed box. You can also use the four-square box to help you remember the right side of the integration- by-parts formula: Start in the upper-left square and draw (or just picture) a number 7 going straight across to the right, then down diagonally to the left. See Figure 16-4. Remembering how you “draw” the 7, look back to Figure 16-3. The right side of the integration- by-parts formula tells you to do the top part of the 7, namely ln /xx 2 3 32, minus the integral of the diagonal part of the 7, 2 3 132x x dx / . By the way, all of this is much easier to do than to explain. Try it. You’ll see how this four-square-box scheme helps you learn the formula and organize these problems. FIGURE 16-3: The completed box for xx dxln . FIGURE 16-4: A box with a 7 in it. Who says calculus is rocket science? 482 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Ready to finish? Plug everything into the formula: udv uv vdu xx x x dx xx x xx dxln ln ln // / 2 3 2 3 1 2 3 2 3 32 32 32 112 32 32 32 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 / // / ln ln dx xx xC x (reverse power rule) xxx C xx xC xx xC 4 9 2 3 2 3 4 9 2 3 4 9 32 32 32 33 / //ln , ln or In the last step, you replace the 2 3 C with C because 2 3 times any old number is still just any old number. Picking your u Here’s a great mnemonic device for how to choose your u chunk (again, once you’ve selected your u, everything else is automatically the dv chunk). The LIATE mnemonic: Herbert E. Kasube came up with the acronym LIATE to help you choose your u (calculus nerds can check out Herb’s article in the American Mathematical Monthly 90, 1983 issue): L Logarithmic like log x I Inverse trigonometric like arctan x A Algebraic like 53 2x T Trigonometric like cos x E Exponential like 10 x To pick your u chunk, go down this list in order; the first type of function on this list that appears in the integrand is the u. Here are some helpful hints on how to remember the acronym LIATE. How about Let’s Integrate Another Tantalizing Example. Or maybe you prefer Lilliputians In Africa Tackle Elephants, or Lulu’s Indigo And Turquoise Earrings. The last one’s not so good because it could also be Lulu’s Turquoise And Indigo Earrings — whoops: Now you’ll never remember it! Here’s a problem. Integrate arctan xdx. (Note: Integration by parts sometimes works for inte- grands like this one that contain a single function.) CHAPTER 16 Integration Techniques for Experts 483 1. Go down the LIATE list and pick the u. You see that there are no logarithmic functions in arctan xdx, but there is an inverse trigonometric function, arctan x. So that’s your u. Everything else is your dv, namely, plain old dx. 2. Do the box thing. See Figure 16-5 (and see Table 15-2 for the derivative of arctan x). 3. Plug everything into the integration-by-parts formula (draw or imagine a 7 in the box on the right in Figure 16-5). udv uv vdu xx x x dxxdxarctan arctan 1 1 2 Now you can finish this problem by integrating x x dx 1 1 2 with the substitution method, setting u x1 2. Try it (see Chapter 15 for more on the substitution method). Note that the u in u x1 2 has nothing to do with the integration-by-parts u. Your final answer should be arctan arctan lnxdxx xx C 1 2 1 2 . Here’s another one. Integrate xx dxsin3 : 1. Go down the LIATE list and pick the u. Going down the LIATE list, the first type of function you find in xx dxsin3 is a very simple algebraic one, namely x, so that’s your u. Everything else is your dv. 2. Do the box thing. See Figure 16-6. FIGURE 16-6: Yet more boxes. FIGURE 16-5: The box thing. 484 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 3. Plug everything into the integration-by-parts formula (draw or imagine a 7 over the box on the right in Figure 16-6). udv uv vdu xx dx xx x x dxsincos cos cos 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3xxx dx 1 3 3cos You can easily integrate cos3xdx with substitution or the guess-and-check method. Go for it. Your final answer: 1 3 3 1 9 3xx xCcossin . Integration by parts: Second time, same as the first Sometimes you have to use the integration-by-parts method more than once because the first run through the method takes you only partway to the answer. Let’s walk through a problem. Find xe dx x2 : 1. Go down the LIATE list and pick the u. You can see that xe dx x2 contains an algebraic function, x 2, and an exponential func- tion, e x. (It’s an exponential function because there’s an x in the exponent.) The first on the LIATE list is x 2, so that’s your u. 2. Do the box thing. See Figure 16-7. 3. Use the integration-by-parts formula — or the “7” mnemonic. xe dx xe exdx xe xe dx xx x xx 22 2 2 2 You end up with another integral, xe dx x , that can’t be done by any of the simple methods — reverse rules, guess and check, and substitution. But note that the power of x has been reduced from 2 to 1, so you’ve made some progress. When you use integration by parts again for xe dx x , the x disappears entirely and you’re done. Here goes: FIGURE 16-7: The boxes for xe dx x2 . CHAPTER 16 Integration Techniques for Experts 485 4. Integrate by parts again. I’ll let you do most of this one on your own. Here’s the final step: xe dx xe edx xe eC xx x xx 5. Take the result from Step 4 and substitute it for the xe dx x in the answer from Step 3 to produce the whole enchilada. xe dx xe xe eC xe xe eC xe xe eC xx xx xx x xx x 22 2 2 2 22 2 22 1 What’s xx dxcos5 2 ? 2 Evaluate xx dxarctan . 3 Evaluate 1 1 10xdx x . 4 What’s xe dx x2 ? 5 Integrate ex dx x sin . Tip: Sometimes you circle back to where you started from — that’s a good thing! 486 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Tricky Trig Integrals Don’t you just love trig? I’ll bet you didn’t realize that studying calculus was going to give you the opportunity to do so much more trig. Remember this next Thanksgiving when everyone around the dinner table is invited to mention something that they’re thankful for. In this section, you integrate powers of the six trigonometric functions, like sin 3 xdx and sec 4 xdx, and products or quotients of different trig functions, like sincos 23xx dx and csc cot 2 x x dx . This is pretty tedious — time to order up a double espresso. To use the following techniques, you must have either an integrand that contains just one of the six trig functions, like csc 3 xdx , or a certain pairing of trig functions, like sincos 2 xx dx . If the integrand has two trig functions, the two must be one of these three pairs: sine with cosine, secant with tangent, or cosecant with cotangent. If you have an integrand containing something other than one of these three pairs, you can easily convert the problem into one of these pairs by using trig identities like sin csc x x 1 and tan sin cos x x x . For instance, sin sectan sin cos sin cos sin cos 2 2 3 2 1 x x x x xx dx x x x dx dx After doing any needed conversions, you want to get one of the following three cases: sincos sectan csccot , mn mn mn xx dx xx dx xx dx where either m or n (or both) is a positive integer. The basic idea with most of the following trig integrals is to organize the integrand so that you can make a handy u-substitution and then integrate with the reverse power rule. You’ll see what I mean in a minute. Integrals containing sines and cosines This section covers integrals with — can you guess? — sines and cosines. Case 1: The power of sine is odd and positive If the power of sine is odd and positive, lop off one sine factor and put it to the right of the rest of the expression, convert the remaining sine factors to cosines with the Pythagorean Identity, and then integrate with the substitution method where u xcos . CHAPTER 16 Integration Techniques for Experts 487 The Pythagorean Identity: The Pythagorean Identity tells you that, for any angle x, sin cos 22 1xx . And thus sin cos 221xx and cos sin 221xx . Now integrate sincos 34xx dx: 1. Lop off one sine factor and move it to the right. sincos sincos sin 34 24xx dx xx xdx 2. Convert the remaining sines to cosines using the Pythagorean Identity and simplify. sin cossin coscos in coscos sin s 24 24 46 1 xx xx xx xdx xdx x ddx 3. Integrate with the substitution method, where uxcos . ux du dx x du xdx cos sin sin Tweak your integral so that it contains what du equals: coscos sin coscos sin 46 46 xx xx xdx xdx Now substitute and solve by the reverse power rule: uu du uu C Cxx x 46 57 57 7 1 5 1 7 1 5 1 7 1 7 1 5 coscos cos or ccos5 xC Case 2: The power of cosine is odd and positive This problem works exactly like Case 1, except that the roles of sine and cosine are reversed. Find cos sin 3 x x dx. 1. Lop off one cosine factor and move it to the right. cos sin cossin cossin cos / / 3 31 2 21 2 x xx xx x dx dx xdx 488 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 2. Convert the remaining cosines to sines with the Pythagorean Identity and simplify. cossin cos sinsin cos sin / / / 21 2 21 2 12 1 xx xx x xdx xdx sincos /32 xx dx 3. Integrate with substitution, where uxsin . ux du dx x du xdx sin cos cos Now substitute: uu du 12 32// And finish integrating as in Case 1. Case 3: The powers of both sine and cosine are even and nonnegative Here you convert the integrand into odd powers of cosines by using the following trig identities. Two handy trig identities: sin cos cos cos2212 2 12 2 xx xx and Then you finish the problem as in Case 2. Let’s go through a problem: sincos sincos coscos 42 22 2 212 2 12 xx dx xx dx xx 22 1 8 12 22 23 dx xx xdxcoscos cos(It s just al’ ggebra!) 1 8 1 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 23dx xdxx dx xdxcoscos cos The first in this string of integrals is a no-brainer; the second is a simple reverse rule with a lit- tle tweak for the 2; you do the third integral by using the cos2 x identity a second time; and the fourth integral is handled by following the steps in Case 2. Do it. Your final answer should be 1 16 1 64 4 1 48 2 3xx xCsinsin A veritable cake walk. CHAPTER 16 Integration Techniques for Experts 489 Don’t forget your trig identities. If you get a sine-cosine problem that doesn’t fit any of the three cases discussed here, try using a trig identity like sin cos 22 1xx or cos cos2 12 2 x x to convert the integral into one you can handle. For example, sin cos 4 2 x x dx doesn’t fit any of the three sine-cosine cases (because when you rewrite the integrand as sin cos 42xx dx , both powers are not non-negative), but you can use the Pythagorean Identity to convert it to 1 2 2 2 cos cos x x dx 12 24 2 coscos cos xx x dx . This splits up into seccos 222xdxx dxdx , and the rest is easy. Try it. See whether you can differen- tiate your result and arrive back at the original problem. 6 Find sincosxx dx 3 3 . 7 Evaluate cossin / 42 6 0 tt dt . Integrals containing secants and tangents (or cosecants and cotangents) The method for solving integrals containing the secant-tangent pairing or the cosecant-cotan- gent pairing is similar to the method used for the sine-cosine problems. In this section, you’ll look at two secant-tangent examples (cosecant-cotangent problems work the same way). You’ll need to use the following Pythagorean Identities. The other Pythagorean Identities: For any angle x, tan sec 221xx and cot csc. 221xx 490 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Case 1: The power of tangent (or cotangent) is odd Q.

Your Worst Nightmare: Trigonometric Substitution With the trigonometric substitution method, you can do integrals containing radicals of the following forms: ua au 22 22, , and ua 22 (as well as powers of those roots), where a is a constant and u is an expression containing x. For instance, 3 22x is of the form au 22 . You’re going to love this technique . . . about as much as sticking a hot poker in your eye. Desperate times call for desperate measures. Consider pulling the fire alarm on the day your teacher is presenting this topic. With any luck, your teacher will decide that they can’t afford to get behind schedule and they’ll just omit this topic from your final exam. Before I show you how trigonometric substitution works, I’ve got some silly mnemonic tricks to help you keep the three cases of this method straight. (Remember, with mnemonic devices, silly [and vulgar] works.) First, the three cases involve three trig functions, tangent, sine, and secant. Their initial letters, t, s, and s, are the same letters as the initial letters of the name of this technique, trigonometric substitution. Pretty nice, eh? Table  16-1 shows how these three trig functions pair up with the radical forms listed in the opening paragraph. 492 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Table 16-1 A Totally Radical Table tan sin sec ua au ua 22 22 22 To keep these pairings straight, note that the plus sign in ua 22 looks like a little t for tan- gent, and that the other two forms, au 22 and ua 22 , contain a subtraction sign — s is for sine and secant. To memorize what sine and secant pair up with, note that au 22 begins with the letter a, and it’s a sin to call someone an ass. Okay, I admit this is pretty weak. If you can come up with a better mnemonic, use it! Ready to do some problems? I’ve stalled long enough. Case 1: Tangents Find dx x94 2 . First, note that this can be rewritten as dx x()32 22 , so it fits the form ua 22 , where u x3 and a 2; you can see that this pairs up with tangent in Table 16-1. 1. Draw a right triangle — basically a SohCahToa triangle — where tan equals u a , which is 3 2 x . Because you know that tan O A (from SohCahToa — see Chapter 6), your triangle should have 3x as O, the side opposite the angle , and 2 as A, the adjacent side. Then, your radical, ()32 22x , or 94 2x , will automatically be the correct length for the hypotenuse. It’s not a bad idea to confirm this with the Pythagorean Theorem, a bc 222. See Figure 16-8. FIGURE 16-8: A SohCahToa triangle for the ua 22 case. What sinister mind dreamt up this technique? CHAPTER 16 Integration Techniques for Experts 493 2. Solve tan 3 2 x for x, differentiate, and solve for dx. 3 2 32 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 2 x x x dx d dx d tan tan tan sec sec 3. Find which trig function is represented by the radical over the a, and then solve for the radical. Look at the triangle in Figure 16-8. The radical is the hypotenuse and a is 2, the adjacent side, so 94 2 2x is H A , which equals secant. So sec 94 2 2x , and thus 94 2 2x sec . 4. Use the results from Steps 2 and 3 to make substitutions in the original problem and then integrate. From Steps 2 and 3, you have dxd 2 3 2sec and 94 2 2x sec . Now you can finally do the integration. dx x d d C 94 2 3 2 1 3 1 3 2 2sec sec sec ln|sec tan| (an iintegral you should memorize or just look up) 5. Substitute the x expressions from Steps 1 and 3 back in for sec and tan . You can also get the expressions from the triangle in Figure 16-8. 1 3 94 2 3 2 1 3 94 3 2 1 3 94 3 1 3 2 2 2 2 ln ln ln xx C xx C xx Cln (by tthe log of a quotient rule, of course, and distributing thee (because ln is just a constant) 1 3 1 3 94 3 2 1 3 2 ) ln xx C C 494 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Now tell me, when was the last time you had so much fun? Before tackling Case 2, here are a couple tips. Step 1 is u a . For all three cases in trigonometric substitution, Step 1 always involves drawing a triangle in which the trig function in question equals u a : Case 1 is Case 2 is sin Case 3 is sec tan. . . u a u a u a The fact that the u goes in the numerator of this u a fraction should be easy to remember because u is an expression in x and something like 3 2 x is somewhat simpler and more natural to see than 2 3x . Just remember, the x goes on top. Step 3 is a . For all three cases, Step 3 always involves putting the radical over the a. The three cases are given here, but you don’t need to memorize the trig functions in this list because you’ll know which one you’ve got by just looking at the triangle — assuming you know SohCahToa and the reciprocal trig functions (flip back to Chapter 6 if you don’t know them). I’ve left out what goes under the radicals because by the time you’re doing Step 3, you’ve already got the right radical expression. Case is Caseis Case is 1 2 3 sec. cos. tan. a a a In a nutshell, just remember u a for Step 1 and a for Step 3. How about U Are Radically Awesome? Case 2: Sines Integrate dx xx 2216 , rewriting it first as dx xx 22 24 so that it fits the form au 22 , where a 4 and u x . 1. Draw a right triangle where sin u a , which is x 4 . Sine equals O H, so the opposite side is x and the hypotenuse is 4. The length of the adjacent side is then automatically equal to your radical, 16 2x . (Confirm this with the Pythagorean Theorem.) See Figure 16-9. CHAPTER 16 Integration Techniques for Experts 495 2. Solve sin x 4 for x, differentiate, and solve for dx. x x dx d dx d 4 4 4 4 sin sin cos cos 3. Find which trig function equals the radical over the a, and then solve for the radical. Look at the triangle in Figure 16-9. The radical, 16 2x , over the a, 4, is A H , which you know from SohCahToa equals cosine. That gives you cos cos 164 16 4 2 2 x x 4. Use the results from Steps 2 and 3 to make substitutions in the original problem and then integrate. Note that you have to make three substitutions here, not just two like in the first example. From Steps 2 and 3, you’ve got xdxd x44 16 4 2sin, cos, cos, and so dx xx d d d 22 2 2 2 16 4 44 16 1 16 1 cos sincos sin csc 116 cot C 5. The triangle shows that cot 16 2x x . Substitute back for your final answer. 1 16 16 16 16 2 2 x x C x x C It’s a walk in the park. FIGURE 16-9: A SohCahToa triangle for the au 22 case. 496 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Case 3: Secants In the interest of space — and sanity — I’m going to skip going through this case in detail. But you won’t have any trouble with it because all the steps are basically the same as in Cases 1 and 2. Try this one. Integrate x x dx 2 9 . I’ll get you started. In Step 1, you draw a triangle, where sec u a , that’s x 3 . Now take it from there. Here’s the answer (no peeking if you haven’t done it yet): x x C 2 2 93 9 3 arctan , or x x C 2 93 3 arcsec , or x x C 2 93 3 arccos . 10 Integrate dx xx94 94 22 . 11 What’s dx x25 2 ? Hint: This is a au 22 problem where u a sin . 12 Integrate dx x625 121 2 . Hint: This is a ua 22 problem where u a sec . 13 Last one: 41 2x x dx. Same hint as in Problem 12. CHAPTER 16 Integration Techniques for Experts 497 The A’s, B’s, and Cx’s of Partial Fractions Just when you thought it couldn’t get any worse than trigonometric substitution, I give you the partial fractions technique. You use the partial fractions method to integrate rational functions like 63 2 2 2 32 xx xx . The basic idea involves “unadding” a fraction: Adding works like this: 1 2 1 3 5 6 . So, you can “unadd” 5 6 by splitting it up into 1 2 plus 1 3 . This is what you do with the partial fraction technique, except that you do it with complicated rational functions instead of ordinary fractions. Before using the partial fractions technique, you have to check that your integrand is a “proper” fraction — that’s one where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denomi- nator. If the integrand is “improper,” like 210 32 32 3 xx xx dx , you first have to do long polyno- mial division to transform the improper fraction into a sum of a polynomial (which sometimes will be just a number) and a proper fraction. Here’s the division for this improper fraction. Basically, it works like regular long division: 3 32 3 2 3 2 2 0 10 2 2 64 66 x x xx x xx xx With regular division, if you divide, say, 23 (the dividend) by 4 (the divisor), you get a quotient of 5 and a remainder of 3, which tells you that 23 4 equals 5 3 4 , or 5 3 4 . The four pieces in this polynomial division (the dividend, the divisor, the quotient, and the remainder) work the same way. The quotient is 2 and the remainder is xx 2 66, thus 210 32 32 3 xx xx equals 2 66 32 2 3 xx xx . The original problem, 210 32 32 3 xx xx dx , therefore becomes 2 66 32 2 3dx xx xx dx. The first integral is just 2xC . You would then do the second integral with the partial fractions method. Let’s walk through a basic problem and then a more advanced one. Case 1: The denominator contains only linear factors Integrate 5 6 2xx dx. This is a Case 1 problem because the factored denominator (see Step 1) contains only linear factors — in other words, first-degree polynomials. (Also note that each 498 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series factor is raised to the 1st power. If one or more factors is raised to a power greater than 1, you have a Case 3 problem.) 1. Factor the denominator. 5 6 5 232xx xx 2. Break up the fraction on the right into a sum of fractions, where each factor of the denominator in Step 1 becomes the denominator of a separate fraction. Then put capital-letter unknowns in the numerator of each fraction. 5 23 23xx A x B x 3. Multiply both sides of this equation by the left side’s denominator. This is basic algebra, so you can’t possibly want to see the steps, right? 53 2Ax Bx 4. Take the roots of the linear factors and plug them — one at a time — into x in the equation from Step 3, and solve for the capital-letter unknowns. If x AB A A 2 52 32 2 55 1 , If x B B B 3 53 33 2 55 1 , 5. Plug these results into the A and B in the equation from Step 2. 5 23 1 2 1 3xx xx 6. Split up the original integral into the partial fractions from Step 5 and you’re home free. 5 6 1 2 1 3 23 2 3 2xx dx x dx x dx xx C x x ln|| ln|| ln C (the log of a quotient rule) Case 2: The denominator contains irreducible quadratic factors Sometimes you can’t factor a denominator all the way down to linear factors because some quadratics are irreducible — like prime numbers, they can’t be factored. CHAPTER 16 Integration Techniques for Experts 499 Check the discriminant. You can easily check whether a quadratic ax bx c 2 is reducible or not by checking its discriminant, b ac 2 4 . If the discriminant is negative, the quadratic is irre- ducible. If the discriminant is a perfect square like 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and so on, the quadratic can be factored into factors you’re used to seeing, like 25 5xx . This is what happens in a Case 1 problem. The last possibility is that the discriminant equals a non-square positive number, as with the quadratic xx 2 10 1, for example, that has a discriminant of 96. In that case, the quadratic can be factored, but you get ugly factors involving square roots. You almost certainly will not get a problem like that. Using the partial fractions technique with irreducible quadratics is a bit different. Here’s a problem: Integrate 59 4 14 3 2 xx xx x dx . 1. Factor the denominator. I did this step for you — a random act of kindness. Note that x 2 4 is irreducible because its discriminant is negative. (Like with the Case 1 example, note that the three factors in this denominator are all raised to the 1st power. If any of the powers had been greater than 1, this would be a Case 3 problem.) 2. Break up the fraction into a sum of “partial fractions.” If you have an irreducible quadratic factor (like the x 2 4), the numerator for that partial fraction needs two capital-letter unknowns instead of just one. You write them in the form of Px Q. 59 4 14 1 4 3 22 xx xx x A x B x Cx D x 3. Multiply both sides of this equation by the left-side denominator. 59 41 44 1 32 2xx Ax xB xx Cx Dx x 4. Take the roots of the linear factors and plug them — one at a time — into x in the equation from Step 3, and then solve. If x A A 0 44 1 , If x B B 1 10 5 2 , Unlike in the Case 1 example, you can’t solve for all the unknowns by plugging in the roots of the linear factors, so you have more work to do. 5. Plug into the Step 3 equation the known values of A and B and any two values for x not used in Step 4 (low numbers make the arithmetic easier) to get a system of two equations in C and D. AB12 and so, If x CD CD CD 1 18 10 10 22 22 2 1 , If x CD CD CD 2 54 8324 2 14 42 72 , 500 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 6. Solve the system: 1 CD and 7 2CD. You should get C 2 and D 3. 7. Split up the original integral and integrate. Using the values obtained in Steps 4 and 6, A 1, B 2, C 2, and D 3, and the equation from Step 2, you can split up the original integral into three pieces: 59 4 14 12 1 23 4 3 22 xx xx x dx x dx x dx x x dx And with simple algebra, you can split up the third integral on the right into two pieces, resulting in the final partial fraction decomposition: 59 4 14 12 1 2 4 3 4 3 22 2 xx xx x dx x dx x dx x x dx x dx The first two integrals are easy. For the third, you use substitution with u x 2 4 and duxdx2 . The fourth is done with the arctangent rule, which you should memorize: dx ax a x a C 22 1 arctan . 59 4 14 21 4 3 22 3 2 2xx xx x dx xx x x Cln ln ln arctan lnnarctanxx x x C14 3 22 2 2 Bonus: Equating coefficients of like terms Here’s another method for finding the capital-letter unknowns that you should have in your bag of tricks. Say you get the following for your Step 3 equation (this comes from a problem with two irreducible quadratic factors): 2 54 12 2 32 22xx xAxB xCxD xx This equation has no linear factors, so you can’t plug in the roots to get the unknowns. Instead, expand the right side of the equation: 2 54 22 22 32 32 32 2xx xAxAxBxB Cx Cx Cx Dx Dx D And collect like terms: 2 54 22 22 32 32xx xA Cx BC Dx AC Dx BD CHAPTER 16 Integration Techniques for Experts 501 Then equate the coefficients of like terms from the left and right sides of the equation: 2 12 52 2 42 AC BC D AC D BD You then solve this system of simultaneous equations to get A, B, C, and D. How about a shortcut? You can finish the Case 2 example by using a shortcut version of the equating-of-coefficients method. Once you have the values for A and B from Step 4, you can look back at the equation in Step 3, and equate the coefficients of the x 3 term on the left and right sides of the equation. Can you see, without actually doing the expansion, that on the right you get AB Cx 3? So, 5 33xA BC x , which means that 5 AB C , and because A 1 and B 2 (from Step 4), C must equal 2. Then, using these values for A, B, and C, and any value of x (other than 0 or 1), you can get D. How about that for a simple shortcut? Practice makes perfect. In a nutshell, you have three ways to find your capital-letter unknowns: 1) Plugging in the roots of the linear factors of the denominator if there are any, 2) Plugging in other values of x and solving the resulting system of equations, and 3) Equating the coef- ficients of like terms. With practice, you’ll get good at combining these methods to find your unknowns quickly. Case 3: The denominator contains one or more factors raised to a power greater than 1 Say you want to integrate 21 1 32 2 x xx dx with the partial fraction technique. This is a Case 3 problem because, unlike in Cases 1 and 2, there are factors in the denominator (in this case, both factors) raised to a power greater than 1. For a problem like this, your Step 2 sum of partial fractions will look like this: 21 1 1 1 32 22 32 2 2 x xx A x B x C x Dx E x Fx G x As you can see, you need a partial fraction for each different power (up to the power on the factor) of any factor that’s raised to a power greater than 1. The rest of a Case 3 solution works the same as in Cases 1 and 2. The remaining steps of the solution for this particular problem are a bit long and messy, because you’ve got six partial fractions. I’ll spare you the gory details, but if you feel like slogging through it, here’s the final solution: 21 1 1 3 21 21 1 2 2 32 2 2 22 2 x xx dx x x x x xx x Cln arctan 502 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 14 Integrate 5 27 4 2 dx xx . 15 Integrate 23 31 45 x xx x dx. 16 What’s xx xx x dx 2 32 1 33 1 ? 17 Integrate dx xx 4265 . 18 Integrate 43 21 1 32 4 xx x x dx . 19 What’s xx xx x dx 2 2211 2 ?

CHAPTER 17 Who Needs Freud? Using the Integral to Solve Your Problems 521 Who Needs Freud? Using the Integral to Solve Your Problems A s I say in Chapter 14, integration is basically just adding up small pieces of something to get the total for the whole thing — really small pieces, actually, infinitely small pieces. Thus, the integral 5 20 sec sec little pieceofdistance . . tells you to add up all the little pieces of distance traveled during the 15-second interval from 5 to 20 seconds to get the total distance traveled during that interval. Chapter 17 IN THIS CHAPTER » One mean theorem: “The Golden Rule!? Don’t make me laugh.” » Adding up the area between curves » Figuring out volumes of odd shapes with the deli meat method » Mastering the disk and washer methods » Finding arc length and surface area » Other stuff you’ll never need 522 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series In all problems, the little piece after the integration symbol is always an expression in x (or some other variable). For the above integral, for example, the little piece of distance might be given by, say, xdx 2 , Then the definite integral 5 20 2xdx would give you the total distance traveled during the time interval. Because you’re now an expert at computing integrals like this one, that’s no longer the issue; your main challenge in this chapter is simply to come up with the algebraic expression for the little pieces you’re add- ing up. But before I begin the adding-up problems, I want to cover another integration topic: The Mean Value Theorem and a function’s average value. The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals and Average Value The best way to understand the Mean Value Theorem for integrals is with a diagram — look at Figure 17-1. The graph on the left in Figure 17-1 shows a rectangle whose area is clearly less than the area under the curve between 2 and 5. This rectangle has a height equal to the lowest point on the curve in the interval from 2 to 5. The middle graph shows a rectangle whose height equals the highest point on the curve. Its area is clearly greater than the area under the curve. By now you’re thinking, “Isn’t there a rectangle taller than the short one and shorter than the tall one whose area is the same as the area under the curve?” Of course. And this rectangle obviously crosses the curve somewhere in the interval. This so-called “mean value rectangle,” shown on the right, basically sums up the Mean Value Theorem for integrals. It’s really just common sense. But here’s the mumbo jumbo. The Mean Value Theorem for integrals: If fx is a continuous function on the closed interval ab, , then there exists a number c in the closed interval such that a bfx dx fc ba FIGURE 17-1: A visual “proof” of the Mean Value Theorem for integrals. CHAPTER 17 Who Needs Freud? Using the Integral to Solve Your Problems 523 The theorem basically just guarantees the existence of the mean value rectangle. (Note that there can only be one mean value rectangle, but its top will sometimes cross the function more than once. Thus, there can be more than one c value that satisfies the theorem.) The area of the mean value rectangle — which is the same as the area under the curve — equals length times width, or base times height, right? So, if you divide its area, a bfx dx, by its base, ba , you get its height, fc . This height is the average value of the function over the interval in question. Average value: The average value of a function fx over a closed interval ab, is 1 ba fx dx a b which is the height of the mean value rectangle. Q. What’s the average speed of a car between t 9 seconds and t 16 seconds whose speed in feet per second is given by the function ft t30 ? A. Approximately 105.7 feet per second. The definition of average value gives you the answer in one step: The average speed is 1 16 9 30 9 16 tdt. Evaluate that integral and you’re done. (That’s all there is to it, so the following two-step process is somewhat superfluous. However, it shows the logic underlying the average value idea.) 1. Determine the area under the curve between 9 and 16. 9 16 32 9 16 30 30 2 3 tdt t / 30 128 3 54 3 740 This area, by the way, is the total distance traveled during the period from 9 to 16 seconds, namely 740 feet. Do you see why? Consider the mean value rectangle for this problem. Its height is a speed (because the function values, or heights, are speeds) and its base is an amount of time, so its area is speed times time, which equals distance. Alternatively, recall that the derivative of position is velocity (see Chapter 12). So, the antiderivative of velocity — what I just did in this step — is position, and the change of position from 9 to 16 seconds gives the total distance traveled. 2. Divide this area, total distance, by the time interval from 9 to 16, namely 7. Averagespeed totaldistance totaltime feet seconds 740 7 105..7 feet per second 524 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series The definition of average value tells you to multiply the total area by 1 ba , which in this problem is 1 16 9 1 7 , or . But because dividing by 7 is the same as multiplying by 1 7 , you can divide like I do in this step. It makes more sense to think about these prob- lems in terms of division: Area equals base times height, so the height of the mean value rectangle equals its area divided by its base. THE MVT FOR INTEGRALS AND FOR DERIVATIVES: TWO PEAS IN A POD Remember the Mean Value Theorem for derivatives from Chapter 11? The graph on the left in the figure shows how it works for the function fx x 3. The basic idea is that there’s a point on the curve between 0 and 2 where the slope is the same as the slope of the secant line from 00, to 28,  — that’s a slope of 4. When you do the math, you get x 23 3 for this point. Well, it turns out that the point guaranteed by the Mean Value Theorem for integrals — the point where the mean value rectangle crosses the derivative of this curve (shown on the right in the figure) — has the very same x-value. Pretty nice, eh? If you really want to understand the intimate relationship between differentiation and integration, think long and hard about the many connections between the two graphs in the accompanying figure. This figure is a real gem, if I do say so myself. (For more on the differentiation/integration connection, check out my other favorites, Figures 15-9 and 15-10.) CHAPTER 17 Who Needs Freud? Using the Integral to Solve Your Problems 525 The Area between Two Curves — Double the Fun This is the first of several topics in this chapter where your task is to come up with an expression for a little bit of something, then add up the bits by integrating. For this first problem type, the little bit is a narrow rectangle that sits on one curve and goes up to another. Let’s walk through an example: Find the area between y x2 2 and y x 1 2 from x 0 to x 1. See Figure 17-2. 1 What’s the average value of fx x x 2 3 1 from 1 to 3? 2 A car’s speed in feet per second is given by ft tt 17 680 . . What’s its aver- age speed from t 5 seconds to t 15 seconds? What’s that in miles per hour? FIGURE 17-2: The area between y x2 2 and y x 1 2 from x 0 to x 1. 526 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series To get the height of the representative rectangle in Figure 17-2, subtract the y-coordinate of its bottom from the y-coordinate of its top — that’s 2 1 2 2xx . Its base is the infinitesimal dx. So, because area equals height times base, Area of representative rectangle xx dx2 1 2 2 Now you just add up the areas of all the rectangles from 0 to 1 by integrating: 0 1 2 32 0 1 2 1 2 2 1 3 1 4 xx dx xx x (power rule for all 33 pieces) square units2 1 3 1 4 000 17 12 Now to make things a little more twisted, in the next problem the curves cross (see Figure 17-3). When this happens, you have to split the total shaded area into two separate regions before integrating. Try this one: Find the area between x 3 and x 3 from x 0 to x 2. 1. Determine where the curves cross. They cross at 11, , so you’ve got two separate regions: one from 0 to 1 and another from 1 to 2. 2. Figure the area of the region on the left. For this region, x 3 is above x 3. So, the height of a representative rectangle is xx 3 3, its area is height times base, or xx dx 3 3 , and the area of the region is, therefore, FIGURE 17-3: Who’s on top? CHAPTER 17 Who Needs Freud?

Add up the areas of the two regions to get the total area. 0 52 61 311.. . square units Height equals top minus bottom. Note that the height of a representative rectangle is always its top minus its bottom, regardless of whether these numbers are positive or negative. For instance, a rectangle that goes from 20 up to 30 has a height of 30 20, or 10; a rectangle that goes from 3 up to 8 has a height of 8 3 , or 11; and a rectangle that goes from 15 up to 10 has a height of 10 15 , or 5. If you think about this top-minus-bottom method for figuring the height of a rectangle, you can now see — assuming you didn’t already see it — why the definite integral of a function counts area below the x-axis as negative. (I mention this in Chapters 14 and 15.) For example, consider Figure 17-4. FIGURE 17-4: What’s the shaded area? Hint: It’s not sin / xdx 0 32 . 528 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series If you want the total area of the shaded region shown in Figure 17-4, you have to divide the shaded region into two separate pieces like you did in the last problem. One piece goes from 0 to , and the other from to 3 2 . For the first piece, from 0 to , a representative rectangle has a height equal to the function itself, y xsin , because its top is on the function and its bottom is at zero — and of course, anything minus zero is itself. So, the area of this first piece is given by the ordinary definite integral sin xdx 0 . But for the second piece from to 3 2 , the top of a representative rectangle is at zero — recall that the x-axis is the line y 0 — and its bottom is on y xsin , so its height is 0 sin x, or just sin x . So, to get the area of this second piece, you figure the definite integral of the negative of the function, sin / xdx 32 , which is the same as sin / xdx 32 . Because this negative integral gives you the ordinary, positive area of the piece below the x-axis, the positive definite integral sin / xdx 32 gives a negative area. That’s why if you figure the definite integral sin / xdx 0 32 over the entire span, the piece below the x-axis counts as a negative area, and the answer gives you the net of the area above the x-axis minus the area below the axis — rather than the total shaded area. 3 What’s the area enclosed by fx x 2 and gx x ? 4 What’s the total area enclosed by ft t 3 and gt t 5? CHAPTER 17 Who Needs Freud? Using the Integral to Solve Your Problems 529 5 The lines y x, y x25, and y x23 form a triangle in the first and fourth quadrants. What’s the area of this triangle? 6 What’s the area of the triangular shape in the first quadrant enclosed by sin x , cos x, and the line y 1 2 ? (I’m referring to the triangular shape that begins at about x 05. and ends at about x 1.) Volumes of Weird Solids: No, You’re Never Going to Need This In geometry, you learned how to figure the volumes of simple solids like boxes, cylinders, and spheres. Integration enables you to calculate the volumes of an endless variety of much more complicated shapes. This section shows you the meat-slicer method, the disk method, and the washer method. The meat-slicer method This metaphor is actually quite accurate. Picture a hunk of meat being cut into very thin slices on one of those deli meat slicers. That’s the basic idea here. You slice up a three-dimensional shape, then add up the volumes of the slices to determine the total volume. Here’s a problem: What’s the volume of the solid whose length runs along the x-axis from 0 to and whose cross sections perpendicular to the x-axis are equilateral triangles such that the midpoints of their bases lie on the x-axis and their top vertices are on the curve y xsin ? Is that a mouthful or what? This problem is almost harder to describe and to picture than it is to do. Take a look at this thing in Figure 17-5. 530 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series So, what’s the volume? 1. Determine the area of any old cross section. Each cross section is an equilateral triangle with a height of sin x . (The height of the second triangle from the left is shown in Figure 17-5 with the vertical dotted segment.) If you do the geometry, you’ll see that the base of each triangle is 23 3 times its height, or 23 3 sin x. (Hint: Half of an equilateral triangle is a 30 60 90 triangle.) So, the triangle’s area, given by Abh 1 2 is 1 2 23 3 sinsinxx, or 3 3 2sin x. 2. Find the volume of a representative slice. The volume of a slice is just its cross-sectional area times its infinitesimal thickness, dx. So, you’ve got the volume of a slice: Volumeofrepresentativeslice xdx 3 3 2sin 3. Add up the volumes of the slices from 0 to by integrating. If the following seems a bit difficult, well, heck, you better get used to it. This is calculus after all. (Actually, it’s not really that bad if you go through it patiently, step by step.)

What’s the volume of the shape shown in the following figure? Its base is formed by the functions fx x and gx x . Its cross sections are isosceles triangles whose heights grow linearly from zero at the origin to 1 when x 1. A. The volume is 2 5 cubic units. 1. Always try to sketch the figure first (of course, I’ve done it for you here). 2. Indicate on your sketch a representative thin slice of the volume in question. This slice should always be perpendicular to the axis or direction along which you are integrating. In other words, if your integrand contains, say, a dx, your slice should be perpendicular to the x-axis. Also, the slice should not be at either end of the three- dimensional figure or at any other special place. Rather, it should be at some arbi- trary, nondescript location within the shape. 3. Express the volume of this slice. It’s easy to show — trust me — that the height of each triangle is the same as its x-coordinate. Its base goes from x up to x and is thus 2 x . And its thickness is dx. Therefore, Volumex xdxx xdxslice 1 2 2 . 532 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 4. Add up the slices from 0 to 1 by integrating. 0 1 0 1 32 52 0 12 5 2 5 xx dx xdxx // cubic units The disk method The disk method is sort of a special case of the meat slicer method that you use when the cross- section slices are all circles. So, the two methods are related, but your approach with the disk method is quite different. Here’s how it works. Find the volume of the solid — between x 2 and x 3 — generated by rotating the curve y e x about the x-axis. See Figure 17-6. 1. Determine the area of any old cross section. Each cross section is a circle with radius e x. So, its area is given by the formula for the area of a circle, Ar 2. Plugging e x into r gives you Ae e xx2 2 2.

(by subst 2 4 6 edu u iitution with and when when ux du dx xu x 22 24 3 ; ,; , cubic units u e ee u 6 2 2 548 4 6 64 ) A representative disk is located at no particular place. Note that Step 1 refers to “any old” cross section. I call it that because when you consider a representative disk like the one shown in Figure 17-6, you should focus on a disk that’s in no particular place. The one shown in Figure 17-6 is located at an unknown position on the x-axis, and its radius goes from the x-axis up to the curve y e x. Thus, its radius is the unknown length of e x. If, instead, you use some special disk like the left-most disk at x 2, you’re more likely to make the mistake of thinking that a representative disk has some known radius like e 2. (This tip also applies to the meat-slicer method in the previous section and the washer method in the next section.) The washer method I could have put the washer method and the disk method in one section and called the section “The disk/washer method,” because the two methods are based on the very same idea. The only difference with the washer method is that each slice has a hole in its middle that you have to subtract. There’s nothing to it. Here you go. Take the area bounded by y x 2 and y x , and generate a solid by revolving that area about the x-axis. See Figure 17-7. Just think: All the forces of the evolving universe and all the twists and turns of your life have brought you to this moment when you are finally able to calculate the volume of this weird solid — something for your diary. So, what’s the volume of this bowl-like shape? 1. Determine where the two curves intersect. It should take very little trial and error to see that y x 2 and y x intersect at x 0 and x 1 — how nice is that? So, the solid in question spans the interval on the x-axis from 0 to 1. 534 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 2. Figure the cross-sectional area of a thin representative washer. Each slice has the shape of a washer — see Figure 17-8 — so its cross-sectional area equals the area of the entire circle minus the area of the hole. The area of the circle minus the hole is Rr 22, where R is the outer radius (the big radius) and r is the hole’s radius (the little radius). For this problem, the outer radius is x and the hole’s radius is x 2, giving you Area xx xx 2 2 2 4 3. Multiply this area by the thickness, dx, to get the volume of a representative washer.

Focus on the simple fact that the area of a washer is the area of the entire disk, R 2, minus the area of the hole, r 2: Thus, Area Rr 22. When you integrate, you get a b Rr dx 22 . If you factor out the pi, and bring it to the outside of the integral, you get a b Rr dx 22 which is the formula given in most books. But if you just learn that formula by rote, you might forget it. You’re more likely to remember the formula and how to do these problems if you understand the simple big-circle-minus-little-circle idea. 7 Use the meat-slicer method to determine the volume of the following solid. The solid’s base is on the x-y coordinate plane; it’s the area surrounded by y x 2, y x 2, and the line x = 1. Cross sections of the solid are squares perpendicular to the x-axis that rise up from the x-y plane. The base of each square runs from y x 2 to y x 2. 536 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 8 Use the meat-slicer method to derive the formula for the volume of a pyramid with a square base (see the following figure). Hint: Integrate from 0 to h along the positive side of the upside-down y-axis. (I set the problem up this way because it simplifies it. You can draw the y-axis the regular way if you like, but then you get an upside-down pyra- mid.) Your formula should be in terms of s and h. 9 Use the washer method to find the volume of the solid that results when the area enclosed by fx x and gx x is revolved around the x-axis. CHAPTER 17 Who Needs Freud? Using the Integral to Solve Your Problems 537 10 Same as Problem 9, but with fx x 2 and gx x4 . 11 Use the disk method to derive the formula for the volume of a cone. Hint: What’s your function? See the following figure. Your formula should be in terms of r and h. Analyzing Arc Length So far in this chapter, you’ve added up the areas of thin rectangles to get total area and the volumes of thin slices to get total volume. Now, you’re going to add up minute lengths along a curve to get the whole length. I could just give you the formula for arc length (the length along a curve), but I’d rather show you why it works and how to derive it. Lucky you. The idea is to divide a length of curve into tiny sections, figure the length of each section, and then add up all the lengths. Figure 17-9 shows how each section of a curve can be approximated by the hypotenuse of a tiny right triangle. 538 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series You can imagine that as you zoom in further and further, dividing the curve into more and more sections, the minute sections of the curve get straighter and straighter, and thus the perfectly straight hypotenuses become better and better approximations of the curve. That’s why — when this process of adding up smaller and smaller sections is taken to the limit — you get the precise length of the curve. So, all you have to do is add up all the hypotenuses along the curve between your start and finish points. The lengths of the legs of each infinitesimal triangle are dx and dy, and thus the length of the hypotenuse — given by the Pythagorean Theorem — is dx dy 22 To add up all the hypotenuses from a to b along the curve, you just integrate: a b dx dy 22 A little tweaking and you have the formula for arc length. First, factor out a dx 2 under the square root and simplify: a b a b dx dy dx dx dy dx 2 2 2 2 2 11 Now you can take the square root of dx 2 — that’s dx, of course — and bring it outside the radical, and, voilà, you’ve got the formula. Arc length formula: The arc length along a curve, y fx , from a to b, is given by the following integral: Arclength dy dx dx a b 1 2 The expression inside this integral is simply the length of a representative hypotenuse. FIGURE 17-9: The Pythago- rean Theorem, a bc 22 2, is the key to the arc length formula. CHAPTER 17 Who Needs Freud?

Your friends will be very impressed — or very concerned. 12 Find the distance from 21, to 510, with the arc length formula. 13 Confirm your answer to Problem 12 with the distance formula. 540 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Surfaces of Revolution — Pass the Bottle ’Round A surface of revolution is a three-dimensional surface with circular cross sections, like a vase or a bell or a wine bottle. For these problems, you divide the surface into narrow circular bands, figure the surface area of a representative band, and then just add up the areas of all the bands to get the total surface area. Figure 17-10 shows such a shape with a representative band. What’s the surface area of a representative band? Well, if you cut the band and unroll it, you get sort of a long, narrow rectangle whose area, of course, is length times width. The rectangle wraps around the whole circular surface, so its length is the circumference of the circular cross section, or 2 r , where r is the height of the function (for garden-variety problems anyway). The width of the rectangle or band is the same as the length of the infinitesimal hypotenuse you used in the section on arc length, namely 1 2dy dx dx . Thus, the surface area of a representa- tive band, from length times width, is 2 1 2 r dy dx dx , which brings you to the formula. Surface of revolution formula: A surface generated by revolving a function, y fx , about an axis has a surface area — between a and b — given by the following integral. Surfacearear dy dx dx r dy dx dx a b a b 21 21 22 If the axis of revolution is the x-axis, r will equal fx  — as shown in Figure 17-10. If the axis of revolution is some other line, like y 5, it’s a bit more complicated — something to look forward to. FIGURE 17-10: The wine bottle problem. If you’re sick of calculus, chill out and take a look at Wine For Dummies. CHAPTER 17 Who Needs Freud? Using the Integral to Solve Your Problems 541 Now try one: What’s the surface area — between x 1 and x 2 — of the surface generated by revolving y x 3 about the x-axis? See Figure 17-11. 1. Take the derivative of your function. yx dy dx x 3 23 Now you can finish the problem by just plugging everything into the formula, but I’ll do it step by step to reinforce the idea that whenever you integrate, you write down a representative little bit of something — that’s the integrand — then you add up all the little bits by integrating. 2. Figure the surface area of a representative narrow band. The radius of the band is x 3, so its circumference is 2 3x  — that’s the band’s “length.” Its width, a tiny hypotenuse, is 11 3 2 2 2dy dx dx xdx. And, thus, its area — length times width — is 2 13 32 2 xx dx.

Integrate to find the area from x 2 to x 5. y x is on the top again, but, for this chunk, y x25 is on the bottom, thus Area xx dx xdx xx 2 5 2 5 2 2 5 25 5 1 2 5 25 2 25 210 9 2 The grand total from Steps 3 and 4 equals 6. Note that you didn’t need the y-coordinates of the three points of intersection of the three lines, but it’s nice to know them, because then you can see exactly where the triangle is. Granted, using calculus for this problem is loads of fun, but it’s totally unnecessary. If you cut the triangle into two triangles — corresponding to Steps 3 and 4 — you can get the total area with simple coordinate geometry. 6 The area is 32 12. 1. Do the graph and find the intersections. a. From the example problem, you know that sin x and cos x intersect at x 4 . b. y 1 2 intersects sin x at sin x 1 2, so x 6 . c. y 1 2 intersects cos x at cos x 1 2 , so x 3 . 2.

You have to add up the square cross sections of this funny shape from 0 to 1. Each square has a base of xx 22 , or 2 2x .

Congrats to anyone who can get through the messiness of this problem to arrive at the beau- tifully simple answer. 5 Use the meat-slicer method to determine the volume of the following solid. The solid’s base is on the x-y coordinate plane; it’s the area in the 1st and 4th quadrants surrounded by fx x 2, gx x, and x 2. Cross sections of the solid are rectangles perpendicular to the x-axis that rise up from the x-y plane. The base of each rectangle runs from gx x up to fx x 2; the height of each rectangle equals the square of its base. 6 Consider the area in the 1st quadrant enclosed by fx x 3 and gx x 3 . What’s the volume of the solid generated by revolving that area about the x-axis? 7 Consider the area in the 1st quadrant enclosed by fx x 2 and gx x .

(Well, each of those two equations actually has an infinite number of solutions, but the three solutions just mentioned are the only ones you need for the two enclosed areas that meet at the origin.) So, you’ve got an enclosed area in the 3rd quadrant from x 4 to x 0 where tan x is on top, and another enclosed area in the 1st quadrant from x 0 to x 4 where sin 2x is on top.

You just have to add up the rectangular cross sections of this odd shape from 0 to 2. Each rectangle has a base of xx 2 , or xx 2 . The height of each rectangle is the square of its base, so each rectangle’s height is given by xx 2 2 , or xx x 43 22 . Area equals base times height, of course, so each rectangular cross section has an area of xx xx x 24 322 , or xxx x 65 4333 .

Now, just plug everything into the arc length formula: Arcength dy dx dx dx dx x l 11 01 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 22 Big surprise. 9 C r2 The equation of a circle with radius r centered at the origin is xy r 22 2. Solve for y to obtain a function of x: y rx 22 . That’s the equation of the top half of the circle. You need its derivative for the arc length formula: yr x y rx x x rx 22 12 22 12 22 1 2 2 Plug this into the arc length formula, and integrate from –r to r to get the length of the top half of the circle (you’ll need to do some not-so-simple algebra): Arclength x rx dx x rx dx rx r r r r r 1 1 22 2 2 22 22 2 xx x rx dx r rx dx r rx dx r rx dx r r r r r r r r 2 2 22 2 22 22 22 1 1 r x r rr r r arcsin 22 That’s the arc length of your semicircle, so that gives you 2 r for the circle’s circumference. 556 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 10 See the following explanation. To create a right circular cylinder with radius r, just take the line y r and revolve it about the x-axis. You need the derivative of this horizontal line for the surface of revolution for- mula. The slope and derivative of any horizontal line is, of course, zero. The cylinder has a height of h, so you need to integrate from 0 to h. Now you’ve got everything you need for the surface of revolution formula: Surfacearear dy dx dx rdx rdx rx a b h h 21 21 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 h rh CHAPTER 18 Taming the Infinite with Improper Integrals 557 Taming the Infinite with Improper Integrals T he main topic of this chapter is really amazing when you stop and think about it: cal- culating the area (or volume) of shapes that are infinitely long. The word infinity comes up in mathematics so often that perhaps we become jaded about the concept and forget how truly incredible it is. It’s about 93 million miles from the Earth to the Sun. That distance is so great that it’s nearly impossible to wrap our minds around it, but it’s nothing compared to the distance to Alpha Centauri A (the nearest star), which is 4.24 light-years away — about 268,000 times as far as the distance to the Sun. Our Milky Way Galaxy is about 100,000 light- years across, and it’s about 4.5 million light-years to our nearest spiral galaxy neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy. Go out about 10,000 times that far and you reach the “edge” of the observ- able universe at about 46 or 47 billion light-years away. That’s definitely quite a ways out there, but it’s nothing compared to infinity. The shapes you deal with in this chapter are not just bigger than the entire universe; they’re so big that they make the universe seem like a speck of dust by comparison. And, yet, using the powerful tools of calculus (including L’Hôpital’s rule), you’re able to compute the area of these gargantuan shapes. And some of them turn out to have nice, manageable areas like, say, 10 square inches! It’s time to get started. Next stop: the twilight zone. Chapter 18 IN THIS CHAPTER » The hospital rule — in case studying calculus makes you ill » Meeting integrals without manners » The paradox of Gabriel’s horn 558 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series L’Hôpital’s Rule: Calculus for the Sick L’Hôpital’s rule is a great shortcut for doing limit problems. Remember limits  — from way back in Chapters 7 and 8 — like lim x x x3 2 9 3 ? By the way, if you’re wondering why I’m showing you this limit shortcut now, it’s because (a) you may need it to solve some improper integral problems (the topic of the next section in this chapter), and (b) you’ll need it for some of the infinite series problems in Chapter 19. As with most limit problems — not counting no-brainer problems — you can’t do lim x x x3 2 9 3 with direct substitution: Plugging 3 into x gives you 0 0, which is undefined. In Chapter 8, you learn to do this problem by factoring the numerator into xx33 and then canceling the x 3 . That leaves you with lim x x 3 3 , which equals 6. Now watch how easy it is to do this limit with L’Hôpital’s rule. Simply take the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator. Don’t use the quotient rule; just take the derivatives of the numerator and denominator separately. The derivative of x 2 9 is 2x and the derivative of x 3 is 1. L’Hôpital’s rule lets you replace the numerator and denominator by their derivatives like this: lim lim x x x x x 3 2 3 9 3 2 1 The new limit is a no-brainer: lim x x 3 2 1 23 1 6 That’s all there is to it. L’Hôpital’s rule transforms a limit you can’t do with direct substitution into one you can do with substitution. That’s what makes it such a great shortcut. Here’s the mumbo jumbo. L’Hôpital’s rule: Let f and g be differentiable functions. If the limit of fx gx as x approaches c produces 0 0 or when you substitute the value of c into x, then lim lim x cx c fx gx fx gx Note that c can be a number or . And note that in the over case, both infinities can be of the same sign or one can be positive and the other negative. Here’s a problem involving : What’s lim ln x x x ? Direct substitution gives you , so you can use L’Hôpital’s rule. The derivative of ln x is 1 x , and the derivative of x is 1, so lim ln lim x x x x x 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 CHAPTER 18 Taming the Infinite with Improper Integrals 559 Here’s another one: Evaluate lim x xe x0 3 1. Substitution gives you 0 0 so L’Hôpital’s rule applies. The derivative of e x3 1 is 3 3e x and the derivative of x is 1, thus lim lim x x x xe x e 0 3 0 313 1 31 1 3 You must have zero over zero or infinity over infinity. The mumbo jumbo says that to use L’Hôpital’s rule, substitution must produce either 0 0 or . You must get one of these acceptable “indeterminate” forms in order to apply the shortcut. Don’t forget to check this. Getting unacceptable forms into shape If substitution produces one of the unacceptable forms, 0 or , you first have to tweak the problem to get an acceptable form before using L’Hôpital’s rule. For instance, find lim x xex . Substituting infinity into x gives you 0 so you’ve got to tweak it: lim lim x x x xex x e Now you’ve got the case, so you’re all set to use L’Hôpital’s rule. The derivative of x is 1 2 x , and the derivative of e x is e x, so lim lim x x x x x e x ee 1 2 1 2 1 0 0 Here’s another problem: What’s lim cosx xx0 1 1 1 ? (Recall from Chapter  7 that lim x 0 means that x approaches 0 from the right only; this is a one-sided limit.) First, substitute zero into x (actually, since x is approaching zero from the right, you must imagine plugging a tiny positive number into x, or you can sort of think of it as plugging a “positive” zero into x). Substitution gives you 1 10 999999 1 0. ... , which results in , one of the unacceptable forms. So, tweak the limit expression with some algebra: lim cos lim cos cos cos x x xx x xx x xx 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 lim cos cosx xx xx0 1 1 560 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Now substitution gives you 0 0, so you can finish with L’Hôpital’s rule: lim cos cos lim sin coss x x xx xx x xx 0 0 1 1 1 11 iin x 10 10 00 1 0 That’s it. Looking at three more unacceptable forms When substitution of the arrow-number into the limit expression produces one of the unacceptable forms 100, , or 0, you use the following logarithm trick to turn it into an acceptable form. Q. Find lim sin x xx 0 . A. The limit equals 1. Substitution gives you sin0 0, which equals 00, so you do the following: 1. Set the limit equal to y. y x x xlimsin 0 2. Take the log of both sides. lnln lim sin lim ln sin( yx x x x x x 0 0 Take my word for it Better review the log rules .) lim ln sin ( x xx 0 iin Chapter 4 if you dont get this ’ .) 3. This limit is a 0 () case, so tweak it. lim ln sin x x x 0 1 CHAPTER 18 Taming the Infinite with Improper Integrals 561 4. Now you’ve got a case, so you can use L’Hôpital’s rule. The derivative of lnsin x is 1 sin cos x x, or cot x , and the derivative of 1 x is 1 2x , so lim ln sin lim cot lim x x x x x x 0 0 2 1 1 xx x x0 2 tan 5. This is a 0 0 case, so use L’Hôpital’s rule again. lim secx x x0 2 20 1 0 Hold your horses! This is not the answer. 6. Solve for y. Do you see that the answer of 0 in Step 5 is the answer to the equation from way back in Step 2: lnln lim sinyx x x 0 ? So, the 0 in Step 5 tells you that ln y 0. Now solve for y: ln y y 0 1 Because you set your limit equal to y in Step 1, this, finally, is your answer: lim sin x x x 0 1 Ordinary math doesn’t work with infinity (or zero to the zero power). Don’t make the mistake of thinking that you can use ordinary arithmetic or the laws of exponents when dealing with any of the acceptable or unacceptable indeterminate forms. It might look like should equal zero, for example, but it doesn’t. By the same token, 0 0, 0 0 1, 1, 0 1 0 , 0 1, and 11. 562 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 1 What’s lim x x x / cos 2 2 ? 2 lim x x x0 2 1cos ? 3 Evaluate lim x xx / tansec 4 16 . 4 What’s lim x xx0 11 sin ? 5 Evaluate lim x xx 0 csclog . 6 What’s lim x xx 0 11 / ? CHAPTER 18 Taming the Infinite with Improper Integrals 563 Improper Integrals: Just Look at the Way That Integral Is Holding Its Fork! Definite integrals are improper when they go infinitely far up, down, right, or left. They go up or down infinitely far in problems like 2 4 1 3x dx that have one or more vertical asymptotes. They go infinitely far to the right or left in problems like 5 2 1 x dx or 1 1 4x dx , where one or both of the limits of integration are infinite. (There are a couple other weird types of improper inte- grals, but they’re rare — don’t worry about them.) It would seem to make sense to just use the term infinite instead of improper to describe these integrals, except for the remarkable fact that many of these “infinite” integrals give you a finite area. More about this in a minute. You solve both types of improper integrals by turning them into limit problems. Take a look at how it works. Improper integrals with vertical asymptotes There are two cases to consider here: problems where there’s a vertical asymptote at one of the edges of the area in question and problems where there’s a vertical asymptote somewhere in the middle of the area. A vertical asymptote at one of the limits of integration What’s the area under y x 1 2 from 0 to 1? This function is undefined at x 0, and it has a vertical asymptote there. So, you’ve got to turn the definite integral into a limit where c approaches the x-value of the asymptote: 0 1 2 0 1 2 11 x dx x dx c c lim (The area in question is to the rigght of zero, so approaches zero from the rightc c .) lim 0 1 xx c c c 1 0 1 1 1 (reverse power rule) lim 1 This area is infinite, which probably doesn’t surprise you because the curve goes up to infinity. But hold on to your hat — the next function also goes up to infinity at x 0, but its area is finite! 564 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Find the area under y x 1 3 from 0 to 1. This function is also undefined at x 0, so the process is the same as in the previous problem: 0 1 3 0 1 3 0 23 1 11 3 2 x dx x dx x c c c c lim lim / (reverse poower rule) lim / c c 0 233 2 3 2 3 2 0 3 2 Convergence and divergence: You say that an improper integral converges if the limit exists — that is, if the limit equals a finite number like in the second problem. Otherwise, an improper integral is said to diverge — like in the first problem. When an improper integral diverges, the area in question (or part of it) usually (but not always) equals infinity or negative infinity. A vertical asymptote between the limits of integration If the undefined point of the integrand is somewhere in between the limits of integration, you split the integral in two — at the undefined point — then turn each integral into a limit and go from there. Evaluate 1 8 31 x dx . This integrand is undefined at x 0. 1. Split the integral in two at the undefined point. 1 8 3 1 0 3 0 8 3 11 1 x dx x dx x dx 2. Turn each integral into a limit and evaluate. For the 1 0 integral, the area is to the left of zero, so c approaches zero from the left. For the 0 8 integral, the area is to the right of zero, so c approaches zero from the right. lim lim lim l / c c c c c c x dx x dx x 0 1 3 0 8 3 0 23 1 11 3 2 iim lim lim / // c c cc x cc 0 23 8 0 23 0 23 3 2 3 2 3 2 6 3 2 3 2 64 5. Keep your eyes peeled for x-values where an integrand is undefined. If you fail to notice that an integrand is undefined at an x-value between the limits of integration, and you integrate the ordinary way, you may get the wrong answer. The above problem, 1 8 31 x dx (undefined at x 0), happens to work out correctly if you do it the ordinary way. However, if you do 1 1 2 1 x dx (also CHAPTER 18 Taming the Infinite with Improper Integrals 565 undefined at x 0) the ordinary way, not only do you get the wrong answer, but you get the totally absurd answer of negative 2, despite the fact that the area in question is above the x-axis and is therefore a positive area. The moral: Don’t risk it. If a part diverges, the whole diverges. If either part of the split-up integral diverges, the origi- nal integral diverges. You can’t get, say, for one part and for the other part and add them up to get zero. Improper integrals with one or two infinite limits of integration You do these improper integrals by turning them into limits where c approaches infinity or negative infinity. Integrals with one infinite limit of integration Let’s look at two somewhat-similar problems: 1 2 1 x dx and 1 1 x dx. 1 2 1 2 1 11 1 11 1 x dx x dx x c c c c c c lim lim lim 01 1 So, this improper integral converges. In the next improper integral, the denominator is smaller, x instead of x 2, and thus the fraction is bigger, so you’d expect 1 1 x dx to be bigger than 1 2 1 x dx, which it is. But it’s not just bigger, it’s way bigger: 11 1 11 1 0 x dx x dx x c c c c c c lim lim ln lim ln ln This improper integral diverges. Figure 18-1 shows these two functions. The area under 1 2x from 1 to is exactly the same as the area of the 1-by-1 square to its left: 1 square unit. The area under 1 x from 1 to is much, much bigger — actually, it’s infinitely bigger than a square large enough to enclose the Milky Way Galaxy. Their shapes are quite similar, but their areas couldn’t be more different. 566 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series By the way, these two functions make another appearance in Chapter 19, which covers infinite series. Deciding whether an infinite series converges or diverges — a distinction quite similar to the difference between these two functions — is one of the main topics in Chapter 19. Integrals with two infinite limits of integration When both of the limits of integration are infinite, you split the integral in two and turn each part into a limit. Splitting up the integral at x 0 is convenient because zero’s an easy number to deal with, but you can split it up anywhere you like. Zero may also seem like a good choice because it looks like it’s in the middle between and . But that’s an illusion because there is no middle between and , or you could say that any point on the x-axis is the middle. Same warning as the one in the section, “A vertical asymptote between the limits of integra- tion.” If either “half” of the split-up integral diverges, the whole, original integral diverges. Q.

Gabriel’s horn is the solid generated by revolving about the x-axis the unbounded region between y x 1 and the x-axis (for x 1). See Figure 18-2. Playing this instrument poses several not-insignificant challenges: 1) It has no end for you to put in your mouth; 2) Even if it did, it would take you till the end of time to reach the end; 3) Even if you could reach the end and put it in your mouth, you couldn’t force any air through it because the hole is infinitely small; 4) Even if you could blow the horn, it’d be kind of pointless because it would take an infinite amount of time for the sound to come out the other end. There are additional difficulties  — infinite weight, doesn’t fit in universe, and so on — but I suspect you get the picture. Believe it or not, Gabriel’s horn has a finite volume, but an infinite surface area! You use the disk method to figure its volume (see Chapter 17). Recall that the volume of each representative disk is rdx 2 . For this problem, the radius is 1 x , so the little bit of volume is 1 2 x dx. You find the total volume by adding up the little bits from 1 to infinity: Volume x dx x dx 1 2 1 2 11 In the section on improper integrals, we calculated that 1 2 1 1 x dx , so the volume is 1, or just . To determine the surface area, you first need the function’s derivative (the method for calcu- lating surface area is covered in Chapter 17): y x dy dx x 1 1 2 FIGURE 18-2: Gabriel’s horn. CHAPTER 18 Taming the Infinite with Improper Integrals 569 Now plug everything into the surface area formula: Surfacerea x x dx x x a dx 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 4 In the previous section, we determined that 1 1 x dx , and because 1 1 1 4x x is always greater than 1 x in the interval [, )1 , 1 4 1 1 1 x x dx must also equal . Finally, 2 times is still , of course, so the surface area is infinite. Bonus question for those with a philosophical bent: Assuming Gabriel is omnipotent, could he overcome the above-mentioned difficulties and blow this horn? Hint: All the calculus in the world won’t help you with this one. 570 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Practice Questions Answers and Explanations 1 lim cos /x x x 2 2 1 1.

Now, compare 1 1 x xdxarctan to 1 1 x dx . But first note that because 1 1 x dx equals infinity, so will 10 1 x dx, 100 1 x dx, or 1 1 000 000 x dx ,, , because the area under 1 x from 1 to any other number must be finite.

Finally, because 1 3 x xdxarctan equals , 1 1 x xdxarctan must as well. Aren’t you glad no work was required for this problem? 12 1 x dx is undefined. Quadruply improper! 1.

Finish: Therefore, the limit doesn’t exist, and the definite integral is thus undefined. Looks can be deceiving. If you look at the graph of y x 1 , its perfect symmetry may make you think that 1 x dx would equal zero. But — strange as it seems — it doesn’t work that way. And, to repeat the warning from earlier in this chapter, you can’t simplify Step 4 to and sum that up to zero.

Replacing the numerator and denominator with their derivatives gives you lim lnx x x e 10 10 , which, again, results in . No problem; from time to time, you have to use L’Hôpital’s rule more than once. With this problem, however, repeated use of L’Hôpital’s rule gets you nowhere. Try it. Tricked you! L’Hôpital’s rule is not needed here. Algebra I is all you need: lim lim . x x x x xee 10 10 Any number, like e 10, that’s between –1 and 1 gets smaller and smaller as you raise it to higher and higher powers, so the limit as x approaches infinity is zero. When doing calculus (or any other type of math), don’t forget to try low-level ideas from pre-algebra, algebra I and II, geometry, trig, and so on. 2 lim tantan x xx x 2 2 1 If you plug 2 in for x, you’ll have something minus itself, so you might think the answer should be zero. But it doesn’t work that way. Be careful: tan x as x approaches 2 from the left equals infinity. And, don’t forget: 0! You’ve got to do a little work so you’ll be able to apply L’Hôpital’s rule. First, factor the limit expression: lim tan x xx 2 2 . Now you’ve got an 0 case, which is usually quite easy to turn into one of the acceptable forms: 0 0 or , to wit: lim cotx x x2 2 is a 0 0 case. Now you’re all set to finish with L’Hôpital’s rule: lim lim cot cscx x x x x22 2 2 1 1 3 lim ln x e x xe e 11 2 22 2 Plugging e into x gives you 0 0, so you’re all set to use L’Hôpital’s rule: lim lim lim ln x ex ex e x xe x x xe 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 22 22 CHAPTER 18 Taming the Infinite with Improper Integrals 577 (a) 31 2 0 3 xe dx x 33 1 2 0 2 0 033 3 xe dx xe dx e xx c x ccc c lim lim lim ee c 3 10 1 (b) 4 3 0 4 xe dx x diverges. 44 1 3 0 3 0 044 4 xe dx xe dx e xx c x ccc c lim lim lim ee c 4 1 (c) 51 4 0 5 xe dx x 55 1 4 0 4 0 055 5 xe dx xe dx e xx c x ccc c lim lim lim ee c 5 10 1 6 ln xdx e 0 0 ln ln ln llim lim limxdxx dx xx xe ec e c e c e cc c0 00 0 1 nncc In the final limit expression, everything equals zero or cancels, leaving only limln c cc 0 .

The natural logarithm function rises from 10, , going to the right toward infinity and going infinitely high. The area, of course, is infinite.

(But — unless your pro- fessor is the world’s most lenient grader — you will certainly lose some points.) CHAPTER 19 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits 581 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits A s with just about every topic in calculus, the subject of this chapter involves the idea of infinity — specifically, series that continue to infinity. An infinite series is the sum of an endless list of numbers like 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 ... . Because the list is unending, it’s not surprising that such a sum can be infinite. What’s remarkable is that some infinite series add up to a finite number. This chapter covers ten tests for deciding whether the sum of a series is finite or infinite. What you do in this chapter is quite fantastic when you think about it. Consider the series 0 10 01 0 001 0 0001.. .. ... . If you go out far enough, you’ll find a number that has so many zeros to the right of the decimal point that even if each zero were as small as a proton, there wouldn’t be enough room in the entire universe just to write it down! As vast as our universe is, anything in it  — say, the number of elementary particles  — is a proverbial drop in the bucket next to the things you look at in this chapter. Actually, not even a drop in the bucket, because next to infinity, any finite thing amounts to nothing. Maybe you’ve heard about the late astronomer, Carl Sagan, getting emotional about the “billions and billions” of stars in our galaxy. “Billions and billions” — pffffftt. Chapter 19 IN THIS CHAPTER » Segueing from sequences into series » An infinite series — the rain delays just wouldn’t end » Getting musical with the harmonic series » Taking a close look at telescoping series » Rooting for the root test » Testing for convergence » Analyzing alternating series 582 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Sequences and Series: What They’re All About Here’s a sequence: 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 ,,, ,... . Change the commas to addition signs and you’ve got a series: 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 ... . Pretty simple, eh? Investigating series is what this chapter is all about, but I need to briefly discuss sequences to lay the groundwork for series. Stringing sequences A sequence is simply a list of numbers. An infinite sequence is an unending list of numbers. That’s the only kind we’re interested in here, and whenever the term sequence (or series) is used alone in this chapter, it means an infinite sequence (or infinite series). Here’s the general form for an infinite sequence: a aa aan12 34,, ,, ... ,, ... where n runs from 1 (usually) to infinity (sometimes n starts at zero or another number). The fourth term of this sequence, for example, is a4 (read “a sub 4”); the nth term is an (read “a sub n”). The thing we care about is what happens to a sequence infinitely far out to the right, or as mathematicians say, “in the limit.” A shorthand notation for this sequence is an . A few paragraphs back, I mentioned the following sequence. It’s defined by the formula an n 1 2 : 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 1 2 ,,, , ... ,, ... n What happens to this sequence as n approaches infinity should be pretty easy to see. Each term gets smaller and smaller, right? And if you go out far enough, you can find a term as close to zero as you want, right? So, lim lim n n n na 1 2 1 2 1 0 Recall from Chapters 7 and 8 how to interpret this limit: As n approaches infinity (but never gets there), an gets closer and closer to zero (but never gets there). Convergence and divergence of sequences Because the limit of the previous sequence is a finite number, you say that the sequence converges. Convergence and divergence: For any sequence an , if lim n naL, where L is a real number (which does not include infinity or negative infinity), then the sequence converges to L. Other- wise, the sequence is said to diverge. (Note: These definitions are very similar to the definitions of these two terms that you saw in Chapter 18.) Sequences that converge sort of settle down to some particular number — plus or minus some miniscule amount  — after you go out to the right far enough. Sequences that diverge never settle down. Instead, diverging sequences might . . . CHAPTER 19 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits 583 » Increase forever, in which case lim n na . Such a sequence is said to “blow up.” A sequence can also have a limit of negative infinity. » Oscillate (go up and down) like the sequence 11 11 11 11,, ,, ,, , ... » Exhibit no pattern at all — this is rare. Sequences and functions go hand in hand The sequence 1 2 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 1 2 nn,,, ,... ,, ... can be thought of as an infinite set of discrete points (discrete is a fancy math word for separate) along the continuous function fx x 1 2 . Figure 19-1 shows the curve fx x 1 2 and the points on the curve that make up the sequence. The sequence is made up of the outputs (the y-values) of the function where the inputs (the x-values) are the positive integers (1, 2, 3, 4, . . .). A sequence and the related function go hand in hand. If the limit of the function as x approaches infinity is some finite number, L, then the limit of the sequence is also L, and thus, the sequence converges to L. Also, the graph of such a convergent function/sequence pair has a horizontal asymptote at y L; the graph in Figure 19-1 has an asymptote with the equation y 0. Determining limits with L’Hôpital’s rule Remember L’Hôpital’s rule from Chapter  18? You’re going to use it now to find limits of sequences. Does the sequence a n n n 2 2 converge or diverge? By plugging in 1, then 2, then 3, and so on into nn 2 2 , you generate the first few terms of the sequence: 1 2 1 9 8 1 25 32 36 64 49 128 64 256 ,, ,, ,, ,,  FIGURE 19-1: The points on the curve fx x 1 2 make up the sequence 1 2 n . 584 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series What do you think? After going up for a couple terms, the sequence goes down and it appears that it’ll keep going down — looks like it will converge to zero. L’Hôpital’s rule proves it. You use the rule to determine the limit of the function fx xx 2 2 , which goes hand in hand with the sequence nn 2 2 . Take two separate derivatives. To use L’Hôpital’s rule, take the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator separately; you do not use the quotient rule. For this problem, you have to use L’Hôpital’s rule twice: lim lim ln lim ln lnx x x x x x xx 2 2 2 22 2 22 2 2 0 Because the limit of the function is zero, so is the limit of the sequence, and thus the sequence nn 2 2 converges to zero. Summing series An infinite series (or just series for short) is simply the adding up of the infinite number of terms of a sequence. Here’s the sequence from the previous section again, an n 1 2 : 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 ,,, ,  And here’s the series associated with this sequence: 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16  You can use fancy summation notation to write this sum in a more compact form: n n 1 1 2 The summation symbol tells you to plug 1 in for n, then 2, then 3, and so on, and then to add up all the terms (more on summation notation in Chapter 14). Nitpickers may point out that you can’t actually add up an infinite number of terms. Okay, so here’s the fine print for the nitpick- ers. An infinite sum is technically a limit. In other words, n n b n b n 11 1 2 1 2 lim To find an infinite sum, you take a limit — just like you do for improper (infinite) integrals (see Chapter 18). From here on, though, I just write infinite sums like n n 1 1 2 and dispense with the limit mumbo jumbo. CHAPTER 19 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits 585 Partial sums Continuing with the same series, take a look at how the sum grows by listing the “sum” of one term (kind of like the sound of one hand clapping), the sum of two terms, three terms, four, and so on: S S S S S n 1 2 3 4 1 2 1 2 1 4 3 4 1 2 1 4 1 8 7 8 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 15 16 1 2 . . . 1 4 1 8 1 16 1 32 1 64 1 2 21 2 ... n n n Each of these sums is called a partial sum of the series. Definition of partial sum: The nth partial sum, S n, of an infinite series is the sum of the first n terms of the series. The convergence or divergence of a series — the main event If you now list the preceding partial sums, you have the following sequence of partial sums: 1 2 3 4 7 8 15 16 ,,, ,... The main point of this chapter is figuring out whether such a sequence of partial sums con- verges — homes in on a finite number — or diverges. If the sequence of partial sums converges, you say that the series converges; otherwise, the sequence of partial sums diverges and you say that the series diverges. The rest of this chapter is devoted to the many techniques used in making this determination. By the way, if you’re getting a bit confused by the terms sequence and series and the connection between them, you’re not alone. Keeping these terms straight can be tricky. For starters, note that there are two sequences associated with every series. With the series 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 ... , for example, you have the underlying sequence, 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 ,,, , ... , and also the sequence of partial sums, 1 2 3 4 7 8 15 16 ,,, , ... . It’s not a bad idea to try to keep these things straight, but all you really need to worry about is whether the series adds up to some finite number or not. If it does, it converges; if not, it diverges. The reason for getting into the somewhat confusing notion of a sequence of partial sums is that the definitions of convergence and divergence are based on the behavior of sequences, not series. Now — don’t get me wrong — in mathematics, ter- minology is important, but it’s the ideas that really matter, and, again, the important idea you need to focus on is whether or not a series sums up to a finite number. 586 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series What about the previous series? Does it converge or diverge? It shouldn’t take too much imag- ination to see the following pattern: S S S S S n n 1 2 3 4 1 2 1 1 2 3 4 1 1 4 7 8 1 1 8 15 16 1 1 16 1 1 2 . . . Finding the limit of this sequence of partial sums is a no-brainer: lim lim n n n nS 1 1 2 1 1 10 1 So, this series converges to 1. In symbols, n n 1 1 2 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 1... By the way, this may remind you of that paradox about walking toward a wall, where your first step is halfway to the wall, your second step is half of the remaining distance, your third step is half the remaining distance, and so on. Will you ever get to the wall? Answer: It depends. More about that later. Convergence or Divergence? That Is the Question This section contains nine ways of determining whether a series converges or diverges. (Then, in the next section on alternating series, you look at a final tenth test for convergence/diver- gence.) Note that all of the series you investigate in this section are made up of positive terms. A no-brainer divergence test: The nth term test If the individual terms of a series (in other words, the terms of the series’ underlying sequence) do not converge to zero, then the series must diverge. This is the nth term test for divergence. CHAPTER 19 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits 587 The nth term test: If lim n na 0, then an diverges. (I presume you figured out that with this naked summation symbol, n runs from 1 to infinity.) (Note: The nth term test not only works for ordinary positive series like the ones in this section, but it also works for series with positive and negative terms. More about this at the end of this chapter in the section, “Alternating Series.”) If you think about it, the nth term test is just common sense. When a series converges, the sum is homing in on a certain number. The only way this can happen is when the numbers being added are getting infinitesimally small  — like in the series I’ve been talking about: 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 ... . Imagine, instead, that the terms of a series are converging, say, to 1, like in the series 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 ... , generated by the formula a n n n 1. In that case, when you add up the terms, you are adding numbers extremely close to 1 over and over and over forever — and this must add up to infinity. So, in order for a series to converge, the terms of the series must converge to zero. But make sure you understand what this nth term test does not say. When the terms of a series converge to zero, that does not guarantee that the series converges. In hifalutin logicianese — the fact that the terms of a series converge to zero is a necessary but not sufficient condition for concluding that the series converges to a finite sum. Because this test is often very easy to apply, it should be one of the first things you check when trying to determine whether a series converges or diverges. If you’re asked to determine whether n n n1 1 1 converges or diverges, note that every term of this series is a number greater than 1 being raised to a positive power. This always results in a number greater than 1, and thus, the terms of this series do not converge to zero, and the series must therefore diverge. Q. Does n n n1 1 1 converge or diverge? A. The series diverges. You can answer this question with common sense if your calc teacher allows such a thing. As n gets larger and larger, 1 1 n increases and gets closer and closer to one. And when you take any root of a number like 0.9, the root is larger than the original number — and the higher the root index, the larger the answer is. So 1 1 n n has to get larger as n increases, and thus lim n n n 1 1 cannot possibly equal zero. The series, therefore, diverges by the nth term test. If your teacher doesn’t like that approach, you can do the following: Plugging into the limit produces 1 1 1/ , which is 1 0, and that equals 1 — you’re done. (Note that 1 0 is not one of the forms that give you a L’Hôpital’s rule problem — see Chapter 18.) Because lim n n n 1 1 equals 1, n n n1 1 1 diverges by the nth term test. (If your teacher is a real stickler for rigor, they might not like this approach either because, technically, you’re not supposed to plug into n even though it works just fine. Oh, well.) 588 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 1 Does n nn nn1 2 2 29 8 52012 converge or diverge? 2 By the nth term test, does n n1 1 converge or diverge? Three basic series and their convergence/ divergence tests In this subsection, you look at geometric series, p-series, and telescoping series. Geometric series and p-series are relatively simple but important series that, in addition to being interest- ing in their own right, can be used as benchmarks when determining the convergence or diver- gence of more complicated series. Telescoping series don’t come up much, but many calculus texts describe them, so who am I to buck tradition? Geometric series A geometric series is a series of the form a ar ar ar ar ar n n23 4 0 ... The first term, a, is called the leading term. Each term after the first equals the preceding term multiplied by r, which is called the ratio. For example, if a is 5 and r is 3, you get 55 35 35 35 15 45 135 23 ... ... You just multiply each term by 3 to get the next term. By the way, the 3 in this example is called the ratio because the ratio of any term divided by its preceding term equals 3, but I think it makes a lot more sense to think of the 3 as your multiplier. CHAPTER 19 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits 589 If a is 100 and r is 0.1, you get 100 100 01 100 01 100 01 100 01 100 1010 10 23 4.. .. ... ..001 ... If that rings a bell, you’ve got a good memory. It’s the series for the “Achilles versus the tortoise” paradox (go way back to Chapter 2). And if a is 1 2 and r is also 1 2, you get the series I’ve been talking so much about: 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 ... The convergence/divergence rule for geometric series is a snap. Geometric series rule: If 0 1r , the geometric series n nar 0 converges to a r1 . If r 1, the series diverges. (Note that this rule works when 10r , in which case you get an alternating series; more about that at the end of this chapter.) In the first example (a half a page back), a 5 and r 3, so the series diverges. In the second example, a is 100 and r is 0.1, so the series converges to 100 10 1 100 09 1111 9.. . That’s the answer to the “Achilles versus the tortoise” problem: Achilles passes the tortoise after running 1111 9 meters. And in the third example, a 1 2 and r 1 2, so the series converges to 1 2 1 1 2 1. This is how far you walk if you start 1 yard from the wall, then step halfway to the wall, then half of the remaining distance, and so on and so on. You take an infinite number of steps, but travel a mere yard. And how long will it take you to get to the wall? Well, if you keep up a constant speed and don’t pause between steps (which, of course, is impossible), you’ll get there in the same amount of time it would take you to walk any old yard. If you do pause between each step, even for a billionth of a second, you’ll never get to the wall. p-series A p-series is of the form n pp pp pn1 11 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 ... (where p is a positive power). The p-series for p 1 is called the harmonic series. Here it is: 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 ... Although this grows very slowly  — after 10,000 terms, the sum is only about 9.79!  — the harmonic series in fact diverges to infinity. By the way, this is called a harmonic series because the numbers in the series have something to do with the way a musical string like a guitar string vibrates — don’t ask. For history buffs, 590 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series in the sixth century B.C., Pythagoras investigated the harmonic series and its connection to the notes of the lyre. Here’s the convergence/divergence rule for p-series. The p-series rule: The p-series n pn1 1 converges if p 1 and diverges if p 1. As you can see from this rule, the harmonic series forms the convergence/divergence border- line for p-series. Any p-series with terms larger than the terms of the harmonic series diverges, and any p-series with terms smaller than the terms of the harmonic series converges. The p-series for p 2 is another common series: 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 4 1 9 1 16 1 25 1 36 1 22 222 ... ... The p-series rule tells you that this series converges. Note, however, that the p-series rule can’t tell you what number this series converges to. (Contrast that to the geometric series rule, which can answer both questions.) By other means — beyond the scope of this book — it can be shown that this sum converges to 2 6 . Multiplying by a constant doesn’t matter. When analyzing the series in this section and the rest of the chapter, remember that multiplying a series by any non-zero constant, big or small and positive or negative, never affects whether it converges or diverges. For example, if n nu 1 converges, then so will 1000 1n nu . Telescoping series You don’t see many telescoping series (and there aren’t any in the practice problems), but the telescoping series rule is a good one to keep in your bag of tricks — you never know when it might come in handy. Consider the following series: n nn1 1 1 1 2 1 6 1 12 1 20 1 30 ... To see that this is a telescoping series, you have to use the partial fractions technique from Chapter 16 — sorry to have to bring that up again — to rewrite 1 1nn as 11 1nn . Now you’ve got n nn nn1 11 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 3 1 3 1 4 1 4 1 5 11 1 ... Do you see how all these terms will now collapse, or telescope? The 1 2 s cancel, the 1 3 s cancel, the 1 4 s cancel, and so on. All that’s left is the first term, 1 (actually, it’s only half a term), and the “last” half-term, 1 1n . So, the sum of the first n terms is simply 1 1 1n . In the limit, as n approaches infinity, 1 1n converges to zero, and thus the sum converges to 10, or 1. CHAPTER 19 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits 591 Each term in a telescoping series can be written as the difference of two half-terms  — call them h-terms. The telescoping series can then be written as hh hh hh hh hhnn12 23 34 45 1... ... I bet you’re dying for another rule, so here’s the next one. Telescoping series rule: A telescoping series of the form immediately above converges if hn 1 converges to a finite number. In that case, the series converges to h h n n11lim . If hn 1 diverges, the series diverges. Note that this rule, like the rule for geometric series, lets you determine what number a con- vergent telescoping series converges to. These are the only two rules I cover where you can do this. The other eight rules for determining convergence or divergence don’t allow you to deter- mine what a convergent series converges to. But hey, you know what they say, “two out of ten ain’t bad.” 3 Does 0 008 0 006 0 0045 0 003375 0 00253125... .. converge or diverge? If it converges, what’s the sum? 4 Does n n1 1 10 converge or diverge? 5 Does 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 n n converge or diverge? 6 Does 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 12 1 16 1 20 converge or diverge? 592 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Three comparison tests for convergence/ divergence Say you’re trying to figure out whether a series converges or diverges, but it doesn’t fit any of the tests you know. No worries. You find a benchmark series that you know converges or diverges and then compare your new series to the known benchmark. For the next three tests, if the benchmark converges, your series converges; and if the benchmark diverges, your series diverges. The direct comparison test This is a simple, common-sense rule. If you’ve got a series with terms that are less than or equal to the terms of a convergent benchmark series, then your series must also converge. And if your series has terms that are greater than or equal to the terms of a divergent benchmark series, then your series must also diverge. Here’s the mumbo jumbo. Direct comparison test: Let 0 abnn for all n. If n nb 1 converges, then n na 1 converges. If n na 1 diverges, then n nb 1 diverges. Let’s walk though a couple problems. Determine whether n n 1 1 53 converges or diverges. Piece o’ cake. This series resembles n n 1 1 3 , which is a geometric series with r equal to 1 3 . (Note that you can rewrite this in the standard geometric series form as n n 0 1 3 1 3 .) Because 0 1r , this series converges. And because 1 53 n is less than 1 3 n for all values of n, n n 1 1 53 must also converge. Here’s another one: Does n n n1 ln converge or diverge? This series resembles n n1 1 , the harmonic p-series that is known to diverge. Because ln n n is greater than 1 n for all values of n 3, ln n nn 1 must also diverge. By the way, if you’re wondering why I’m allowed to consider only the terms where n 3, here’s why: Feel free to ignore initial terms. For any of the convergence/divergence tests, you can disregard any number of terms at the beginning of a series. And if you’re comparing two series, you can ignore any number of terms from the beginning of either or both of the series — and you can ignore a different number of terms in each of the two series. This utter disregard of innocent beginning terms is allowed because the first, say, 10 or 1000 or 1,000,000 terms of a series always sum to a finite number and thus never have any effect on whether the series converges or diverges. Note, however, that disregarding a number of terms would affect the total that a convergent series converges to. CHAPTER 19 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits 593 (Are you wondering why this disregard of beginning terms doesn’t violate the direct compari- son test’s requirement that 0 abnn for all n? Everything’s copacetic because you can lop off any number of terms at the beginning of each series and let the counter, n, start at 1 anywhere in each series. Thus the “first” terms a1 and b1 can actually be located anywhere along each series. See what I mean?) Fore! (That was a joke.) The direct comparison test tells you nothing if the series you’re inves- tigating is greater than a known convergent series or less than a known divergent series. For example, say you want to determine whether 1 101 nn converges. This series resembles 1 1 nn , which is a p-series with p equal to 1 2. The p-series test says that this series diverges, but that doesn’t help you because the terms of your series are less than the terms of this known divergent benchmark. Instead, you should compare your series to the divergent harmonic series, n n1 1 . Your series, 1 10 n , is greater than 1 n for all n 14 (it takes a little work to show this; give it a try). Because your series is greater than the divergent harmonic series, your series must also diverge. The limit comparison test The idea behind this test is related to the tip just before the subsection “Telescoping series.” If you take a known convergent series and multiply each of its terms by any non-zero number, big or small, then that new series also converges. The same thing goes for a divergent series multiplied by any non-zero number. That new series also diverges. This is an oversimplified explanation — with the limit comparison test, it’s only in the limit that one series is sort of a multiple of the other — but it conveys the basic principle. You can discover whether such a connection exists between two series by looking at the ratio of the nth terms of the two series as n approaches infinity. Here’s the test. Limit comparison test: For two series, an and bn, if a bnn00,, and lim n n n a b L, where L is finite and positive, then either both series converge or both diverge. Use this test when your series goes the wrong way. This is a good test to use when you can’t use the direct comparison test for your series because it goes the wrong way — in other words, your series is larger than a known convergent series or smaller than a known divergent series. Q. Does n nn2 2 1 ln converge or diverge? A. The series converges. This series resembles the convergent p-series, 1 2n , so that’s your benchmark. But you can’t use the direct comparison test because the terms of your series are greater than 1 2n . Instead, you use the limit comparison test. 594 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Take the limit of the ratio of the nth terms of the two series. It doesn’t matter which series you put in the numerator and which in the denominator, but putting the known, benchmark series in the denominator makes it a little easier to do these problems and grasp the results. lim ln lim ln lim ( n n n nn n n nn n n n 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 L Hpital’ô ’ss LH pitals rule rule again ) ()lim n n 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 20 1 2 ’ô ’ Because the limit is finite and positive and because the benchmark series converges, your series must also converge. Thus, n nn2 2 1 ln converges. Use this test for rational functions. The limit comparison test is a good one for series where the general term is a rational function — in other words, where the general term is a quotient of two polynomials. Q. Determine the convergence or divergence of n nn nn1 2 3 51 43 . A. The series diverges. 1. Determine the benchmark series. Take the highest power of n in the numerator and the denominator — ignoring any coefficients and all other terms — then simplify. Like this: That’s the benchmark series, 1 n , the divergent harmonic series. CHAPTER 19 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits 595 2. Take the limit of the ratio of the nth terms of the two series. lim lim lim n n n nn nn n nn n nn n n 51 43 1 5 43 5 11 2 3 32 3 22 23 3 1 43 5 1 nn n()dividing numerator and denominator by 11 1 43 50 0 10 0 5 3. Because the limit from Step 2 is finite and positive and because the benchmark series diverges, your series must also diverge. Thus, n nn nn1 2 3 51 43 diverges. Okay, so I’m a rebel. The limit comparison test is always stated as it appears at the beginning of this section, but I want to point out — recklessly ignoring the noble tradition of calculus textbook authors — that in a sense it’s incomplete. The limit, L, doesn’t have to be finite and positive for the test to work. First, if the benchmark series is convergent, and you put it in the denominator of the limit, and the limit is zero, then your series must also converge. Note that if the limit is infinity, you can’t conclude anything. And second, if the benchmark series is diver- gent, and you put it in the denominator, and the limit is infinity, then your series must also diverge. If the limit is zero, you can’t conclude anything. The integral comparison test The third benchmark test involves comparing the series you’re investigating to its companion improper integral (see Chapter 18 for more on improper integrals). If the integral converges, your series converges; and if the integral diverges, so does your series. By the way, to the best of my knowledge, no one else calls this the integral comparison test — but they should because that’s the way it works. Q. Determine the convergence or divergence of n nn2 1 ln . A. The series diverges. The direct comparison test doesn’t work because the terms of this series are less than the terms of the divergent harmonic series, 1 n . Trying the limit comparison test is the next natural choice, but it doesn’t work either — try it. But if you notice that the series 596 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series is an expression you know how to integrate, you’re home free (you did notice that, right?). Just compute the companion improper integral with the same limits of integra- tion as the index numbers of the summation — like this: 2 2 2 1 1 1 xx dx xx dx u du b b b b ln lim ln lim ln ln (substitution with and when and when ux du x dx xu xb ub ln ; ,ln, ,ln) 1 22 llim ln lim ln ln ln ln ln ln ln ln ln ln b b b u b 2 2 2 ln ln 2 Because the integral diverges, your series diverges. After you’ve determined the convergence or divergence of a series with the integral comparison test, you can then use that series as a benchmark for investigating other series with the direct comparison or limit comparison tests. For instance, the integral test just told you that n nn2 1 ln diverges. Now you can use this series to investigate n nn n3 1 ln with the direct comparison test. Do you see how? Or you can inves- tigate, say, n nn n1 1 ln with the limit comparison test. Try it. Don’t forget the integral test. The integral comparison test is fairly easy to use, so don’t neglect to ask yourself whether you can integrate the series expression or something close to it. If you can, it’s a BINGO. By the way, in Chapter 18, you saw the following two improper integrals: 1 1 x dx , which diverges, and 1 2 1 x dx, which converges. Look back at Figure 18-1. Now that you know the integral com- parison test, you can appreciate the connection between those integrals and their companion p-series: the divergent harmonic series, n n1 1 , and the convergent p-series, n n1 2 1 . Here’s the mumbo jumbo for the integral comparison test. Note the fine print. Integral comparison test: If fx is positive, continuous, and decreasing for all x 1 and if a fnn , then n na 1 and 1 fx dx either both converge or both diverge. CHAPTER 19 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits 597 7 For Problems 7 through 14, determine whether the series converges or diverges. n n n1 10 09. 8 n n n1 11 10 . 9 1 1001 1 2001 1 3001 1 4001 10 n nn n1 1 ln 11 n nn1 33 1 ln 12 n nn n2 1 ln sin 598 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 13 n n n e1 2 3 14 n n n1 3 ! (Given that 1 n! converges.) The two “R” tests: Ratios and roots Unlike the three benchmark tests from the previous section, the ratio and root tests don’t com- pare a new series to a known benchmark. They work by looking only at the nature of the series you’re trying to figure out. They form a cohesive pair because the results of both tests tell you the same thing. If the result is less than 1, the series converges; if it’s more than 1, the series diverges; and if it’s exactly 1, you learn nothing and must try a different test. (As presented here, the ratio and root tests are used for series of positive terms. In other books, you may see a different version of each test that uses the absolute value of the terms. These absolute value versions can be used for series made up of both positive and negative terms. Don’t sweat this; the different versions amount to the same thing.) The ratio test: Given a series un, consider the limit of the ratio of a term to the previous term, lim n n n u u 1 . If this limit is less than 1, the series converges. If it’s greater than 1 (this includes ), the series diverges. And if it equals 1, the ratio test tells you nothing. When to use the ratio test. The ratio test works especially well with series involving factorials like n! or where n is in the power, like 3 n. Definition of the factorial symbol. The factorial symbol ( ! ), tells you to multiply like this: 6 65 43 21! . And notice how things cancel when you have factorials in the numerator and denominator of a fraction: 6 5 65 43 21 54 32 1 6 ! ! and 5 6 54 32 1 65 43 21 1 6 ! ! . In both cases, everything cancels but the 6. In the same way, ()! ! nn n 1 1 and n nn ! ()!1 1 1; everything cancels but the ( )n 1 . Lastly, it seems weird, but 0 1!  — just take my word for it. CHAPTER 19 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits 599 Q. Does n n n0 3 ! converge or diverge? A. The series converges. Here’s what you do. You look at the limit of the ratio of the n 1st term to the nth term: lim ! ! lim ! ! lim n n n n n n n n n n n n 3 1 3 3 13 3 1 3 1 1 11 0 Because this limit is less than 1, n n n0 3 ! converges. Q. Here’s another series: n nn n1 ! . What’s your guess — does it converge or diverge? A. The series diverges. Look at the limit of the n 1st term over the nth term: lim ! ! lim ! ! lim n n n n n n n n n n n nn nn 1 1 1 1 1 1 nn nn n n 1 1 1 lim lim lim ( lim n n n n n n n n nn nn n e n 1 1 1 1 1 1 nn e is one of the limits you should memorize, as discussed in Chapter 8.) .2 718 Because the limit is greater than 1, n nn n1 ! diverges. 600 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series The root test: Note its similarity to the ratio test. Given a series un, consider the limit of the nth root of the nth term, lim n n n u . If this limit is less than 1, the series converges. If it’s greater than one (including ), the series diverges. And if it equals 1, the root test says nothing. When to use the root test. The root test (like the ratio test) is a good one to try if the series involves nth powers. (If you’ve got an nth power problem, and you’re not sure which of the two tests to try first, start with the ratio test — it’s often the easier one to use.) Q. Does n n n e n1 2 converge or diverge? A. The series converges. Here’s what you do: lim lim lim / / n n n n n nn nn n e n e n e n e 2 2 2 2 0 Because the limit is less than 1, the series converges. (By the way, you can also do this series with the ratio test, but it’s harder — an exception to the rule of thumb in the previous tip.) Making a good guess about convergence/divergence: Sometimes it’s useful to make an edu- cated guess about the convergence or divergence of a series before you launch into one or more of the convergence/divergence tests. Here’s a tip that helps you make a good guess with some series. (Much of this tip is virtually identical to the tip in Chapter 8 about evaluating limits at infinity.) The following expressions are listed from “smallest” to “largest”: n10, 5 n, n!, and n n. A series with a “smaller” expression over a “larger” one converges, for example, n n n1 50 ! or n n n n1 ! ; and a series with a “larger” expression over a “smaller” one diverges, for instance, n n n n 1 100 or n n n1 100 25 . Note a few things: » Coefficients don’t change the order — for example, 1000 12 5 300 0 065 10nn n nn,, !, . and . » For the first expression (n10), the power can be any number; for the second expression (5 n), the number must be greater than one. » Replacing n with a multiple of n (like 510n or 6 6n n) doesn’t change the order — with one important exception: With the factorial expression, replacing the n with kn (if k 1 like with 4n ! or 18.!n ) makes the expression the largest of the four; if 0 < k < 1, the order doesn’t change. CHAPTER 19 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits 601 15 For Problems 15 through 20, determine whether the series converges or diverges. n n n1 1 2ln 16 n n n n n1 17 n n n n1 ! 18 n n n 1 3 4 19 n nn n1 ! 20 n n n 1 4 ! 602 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Alternating Series In the previous sections, you’ve been looking at series of positive terms. Now you look at alter- nating series — series where the terms alternate between positive and negative — like this: 1 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 1 32 1 64 ... Finding absolute versus conditional convergence Many divergent series of positive terms converge if you change the signs of their terms so they alternate between positive and negative. For example, you know that the harmonic series diverges: 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 ... But, if you change every other sign to negative, you obtain the alternating harmonic series, which converges: 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 ... By the way, although I’m not going to show you how to compute it, this series converges to ln2, which equals about 0.6931. Definition of conditional convergence: An alternating series is said to be conditionally conver- gent if it’s convergent as it is but would become divergent if all its terms were made positive. Definition of absolute convergence: An alternating series is said to be absolutely convergent if it would be convergent even if all its terms were made positive. And any such absolutely conver- gent alternating series is also automatically convergent as it is. Q. Determine the convergence or divergence of the following alternating series: 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 160 n n n A. The series converges. If all these terms were positive, you’d have the familiar geometric series, 1 2 1 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 160 n n which, by the geometric series rule, converges to 2. Because the positive series con- verges, the alternating series must also converge (though to a different result — see the following) and you say that the alternating series is absolutely convergent. CHAPTER 19 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits 603 The fact that absolute convergence implies ordinary convergence is just common sense if you think about it. The previous geometric series of positive terms converges to 2. If you made all the terms negative, it would sum to –2, right? So, if some of the terms are positive and some negative, the series must converge to something between –2 and 2. Did you notice that the alternating series is a geometric series as it is with r 1 2 ? (Recall that the geometric series rule works for alternating series as well as for positive series.) The geometric series rule gives its sum: a r1 1 1 1 2 2 3 . The alternating series test Alternating series test: An alternating series converges if two conditions are met: 1. Its nth term converges to zero. 2. Its terms are non-increasing — in other words, each term is less than or equal to its predecessor (ignoring the minus signs). (Note that you are free to ignore any number of initial terms when checking whether condition 2 is satisfied.) Using this simple test, you can easily show many alternating series to be convergent. The terms just have to converge to zero and get smaller and smaller (they rarely stay the same). The alter- nating harmonic series converges by this test: n n n1 11 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 ... So does the alternating geometric series I discussed at the end of the previous section. And so do the following two series: n n n n n n 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 1 1 1 ... 223 45 6 11 11 222 22 ... The alternating series test can’t tell you whether a series is absolutely or conditionally convergent. The alternating series test can only tell you whether an alternating series itself converges. The test says nothing about the corresponding positive-term series. In other words, the test cannot tell you whether a series is absolutely convergent or conditionally convergent. To answer that, you must investigate the positive series with a different test. 604 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Q. Determine the convergence or divergence of the following alternating series. If conver- gent, determine whether the convergence is conditional or absolute. n n n n3 11 ln A. The series is conditionally convergent. 1. Check that the nth term converges to zero. by L’Hpital’s rule lim ln lim () n n n n n 1 1 0 ô Consider the nth term. Always check the nth term first because if it doesn’t converge to zero, you’re done — the alternating series and the positive series will both diverge. Note that the nth term test of divergence (see the section on the nth term test) applies to alternating series as well as positive series. 2. Check that the terms decrease or stay the same (ignoring the minus signs). To show that ln n n decreases, take the derivative of the function fx x x ln . Remember differentiation? I know it’s been a while. fx x xx xx x 1 1 2 2 ln ln (quotient rule) This is negative for all x 3 (because the natural log of anything 3 or greater is more than 1, and xx 2 3 for is always positive), so the derivative and thus the slope of the function are negative, and therefore the function is decreasing. Finally, because the function is decreasing, the terms of the series are also decreasing (when n 3). That does it: n n n n3 11 ln converges by the alternating series test. 3. Determine the type of convergence. You can see that for n 3 the positive series, ln n n , is greater than the divergent har- monic series, 1 n , so the positive series diverges by the direct comparison test. Thus, the alternating series is conditionally convergent. I can’t think of a good title for this warning. If the alternating series fails to satisfy the second requirement of the alternating series test, it does not follow that your series diverges, only that this test fails to show convergence. You’re getting so good at this, so how about another problem? CHAPTER 19 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits 605 Q. Test the convergence of n n n n4 31 ln . You might want to consider the positive series first. If you think you can show that the positive series converges or diverges, you may want to try that before using the alter- nating series test, because . . . You may have to do this later anyway to determine the type of convergence, and If you can show that the positive series converges, you’re done in one step, and you’ve shown that the alternating series is absolutely convergent. A. The alternating series converges absolutely. Because the positive series ln n n3 resembles the convergent p-series, 1 3n , you guess that it converges. So, try to show the convergence of the positive series n n n4 3 ln . The limit com- parison test seems appropriate here, and n n4 3 1 is the natural choice for the benchmark series, but with that benchmark, the test fails — try it. When this happens, you can sometimes get home by trying a larger convergent series. So, try the limit comparison test with the convergent p-series, n n4 2 1 : lim ln lim ln ( n n n n n n n 3 2 1 0I didthisinthe previous problemwitth L’Hpital’s rule.ô) Because this limit is zero, the positive series n n n4 3 ln converges (see the section, “The limit comparison test”); and because the positive series converges, so does the given alternating series. Thus, n n n n4 31 ln converges absolutely. Q. One last problem and I’ll let you go. Test the convergence of n n n n1 11 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 .... This is an easy one. A. The series diverges. The nth term of this series (ignoring the minus signs) converges to 1 (it’s a L’Hôpital’s rule no-brainer), so you’re done. Because the nth term does not converge to zero, the series diverges by the nth term test. For Problems 21 and 22, determine whether the series converges or diverges. If the series converges, determine whether the convergence is absolute or conditional. 606 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 21 n n n n1 11 1 31 22 n n n n3 21 1 2 Keeping All the Tests Straight You now probably feel like you know — have a vague recollection of? — a gazillion conver- gence/divergence tests and are wondering how to keep track of all of them. Actually, I’ve given you only ten tests in all — that’s a nice, easy-to-remember round number. Here’s how you can keep the tests straight. First are the three series with names: the geometric series, p-series, and telescoping series. A geometric series converges if 0 1r . A p-series converges if p 1. A telescoping series con- verges if the second “half-term” converges to a finite number. Next are the three comparison tests: the direct comparison, limit comparison, and integral comparison tests. All three compare a new series to a known benchmark series. If the bench- mark series converges, so does the series you’re investigating; if the benchmark diverges, so does your new series. And then you have the two “R” tests: the ratio test and the root test. Both analyze just the series in question instead of comparing it to a benchmark series. Both involve taking a limit, and the results of both are interpreted the same way. If the limit is less than 1, the series converges; if the limit is greater than 1, the series diverges; and if the limit equals 1, the test is inconclusive. Finally, you have two tests that form bookends for the other eight — the nth term test of diver- gence and the alternating series test. These two form a coherent pair. You can remember them as the nth term test of divergence and the nth term test of convergence. The alternating series test involves more than just testing the nth term, but this is a good memory aid. Well, there you have it: Calculus, schmalculus. CHAPTER 19 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits 607 Practice Questions Answers and Explanations 1 n nn nn1 2 2 29 8 52012 diverges. You know (vaguely remember?) from Chapter 8 on limits that lim x xx xx 29 8 52012 2 5 2 2 by the horizontal asymptote rule. Because this limit doesn’t converge to zero, neither does the underlying sequence of the series. And, therefore, the nth term test tells you that the series must diverge. 2 n n1 1 converges . . . . NOT. It should be obvious that lim n n 1 0. If you conclude that the series, n n1 1 , must therefore converge by the nth term test, I’ve got some good news and some bad news for you. The bad news is that you’re wrong — you have to use the p-series test to find out whether this converges or not (check out the solution to Problem 4). The good news is that you made this mistake here instead of on a test. Don’t forget that the nth term test is no help in determining the convergence or divergence of a series when the underlying sequence converges to zero. 3 0.008 0.006 0.0045 0.003375 0.00253125 converges to 4 875 . 1.

Probably the easiest way is to, first, simply pull the 10 (actually it’s 1 10) to the outside of the sigma symbol (you learn in Chapter 14 that this is allowed). That gives you: 1 10 1 1 nn . And that’s 1 10 times the divergent harmonic series (it’s divergent because it’s a p-series with p 1). That does it. The tip just above the “Telescoping series” subsection says that multiplication by a constant doesn’t affect the convergence or divergence of a series, so, since 1 1 nn is known to diverge, 1 10 1 10 1 11nnnn must diverge as well. 608 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 5 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 n n diverges. This may not look like a p-series, but you can’t always judge a book by its cover. 1. Rewrite the terms with exponents instead of roots. 1 22 33 44 14 14 14 14// //n n 2. Use ordinary laws of exponents to simplify. 1 1 2 1 3 1 3 1 34 34 34 34/// /n 3. Apply the p-series rule. You’ve got a p-series with p 3 4 , so this series diverges. 6 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 12 1 16 1 20 diverges. This looks like it might be a geometric series, so: 1. Find the first ratio. 1 4 1 2 1 2 2. Test the other pairs. 1 8 1 4 1 2 1 12 1 8 1 2 ?. ?.Check No Thus, this is not a geometric series, and therefore the geometric series rule does not apply. 3. Try something else. The key to this problem is to notice the simple pattern in the denominators (ignoring the first term): namely, 4, 8, 12, 16, . . . . They’re the multiples of 4, of course. Thus, you can write the sum (again, ignoring the first term) as 1 41 nn . And that equals 1 4 1 1 nn . This is a constant times the divergent harmonic series, and (just like you saw in the solution to Problem 4) this multiplication doesn’t affect divergence. Therefore, 1 4 1 1 nn diverges. Finally, if all the terms beginning with 1 4 sum to infinity, adding back the 1 2 still gives you infinity. 7 n n n1 10 09. converges. 1. Look in the summation expression for a series you recognize that can be used for your benchmark series. You should recognize 09. n as a convergent geometric series, because r, namely 0.9, is between 0 and 1. CHAPTER 19 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits 609 2. Use the direct comparison test to compare n n n1 10 09. to n n 1 09. . First, you can pull the 10 out and ignore it because multiplying a series by a constant has no effect on its convergence or divergence. That gives you n n n1 09. . Now, because each term of n n n1 09. is less than or equal to the corresponding term of the convergent series n n 1 09. , n n n1 09. has to converge as well. Finally, because n n n1 09. converges, so does n n n1 10 09. . 8 n n n1 11 10 . diverges. 1. Find an appropriate benchmark series. Like in Problem 7, there is a geometric series in the numerator, n n 1 11. . By the geometric series rule, it diverges. But unlike Problem 7, this doesn’t help you, because the given series is less than that divergent geometric series. Use the series in the denominator instead: n n n n nn11 11 10 1 10 11.. The denominator of n n n1 11. is the divergent p-series n n1 1 . 2. Apply the direct comparison test. Because each term of n n n1 11. is greater than the corresponding term of the divergent series n n1 1 , n n n1 11. diverges as well — and therefore so does n n n1 11 10 . . 9 1 1001 1 2001 1 3001 1 4001 diverges. 1. Ask yourself what this series resembles. It’s sort of like the divergent harmonic series, 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 , right? 2. Multiply the given series by 1001 so that you can compare it to the harmonic series. 1001 1 1001 1 2001 1 3001 1 4001 1001 1001 1001 2001 1001 3001 1001 4001 3. Use the direct comparison test. It’s easy to show that the terms of the series in Step 2 are greater than or equal to the terms of the divergent p-series, so it, and thus your given series, diverges as well. 610 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 10 n nn n1 1 ln diverges. Try the limit comparison test: Use the divergent harmonic series n n1 1 as your benchmark. lim lim lim by LH pita n n n nn n n n nn n n n 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 ln ln (’ ôlls rule)’ 1 Because the limit is finite and positive, the limit comparison test tells you that n nn n1 1 ln diverges along with the benchmark series. By the way, you could do this problem with the direct comparison test as well. Do you see how? Hint: You can use the harmonic series as your benchmark, but you have to tweak it first. 11 n nn1 33 1 ln converges. 1. Do a quick check to see whether the direct comparison test will give you an immediate answer. It doesn’t because n nn1 33 1 ln is greater than the known convergent p-series n n1 3 1 . 2.

( 1 1 1 1 3 n n ’ô ’’s rule) 1 Because this is finite and positive, the limit comparison test tells you that since the bench- mark series converges, n nn1 33 1 ln must converge as well. 12 n nn n2 1 ln sin diverges. 1.

Try the direct comparison test. It won’t work yet because 1 nn nln sin is sometimes less than the divergent series 1 nnln . 3. Try multiplication by a constant (always easy to do and always a good thing to try). n nn2 1 ln diverges; thus, so does 1 2 11 222nnnn nnln ln . 4. Now try the direct comparison test again. It’s easy to show that 1 nn nln sin is always greater than 1 2 2 nn n ln for , and thus the direct comparison test tells you that n nn n2 1 ln sin must diverge along with n nn2 1 2ln . 612 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 13 n n n e1 2 3 converges.

Try the limit comparison test with the convergent series, n n1 1 ! , as the benchmark. lim lim nn n n n nn n 3 3 1 ! ! ! ! . No good. This result tells you nothing. 2. Try the following nifty trick. Ignore the first three terms of n n n1 3 ! , which doesn’t affect the convergence or divergence of the series. (You ignore three terms because the power on n is 3; that’s what makes this trick work.) The series is now 4 4 5 5 6 6 333 !! ! , which can be written as n n n1 33 3! . 3.

And because n n n1 3 ! is the same series except for its first three terms, it converges as well. 15 n n n1 1 2ln converges. Try the root test: lim lim n n n n n n 1 2 1 2 0 1 ln ln / This is less than 1, so the series converges. CHAPTER 19 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits 613 16 n n n n n1 converges. Try the root test again: lim lim lim lim n n n n nn n nn nn n n n n nn 1 12 12 12 1 11 nn 0 Thus the series converges. 17 n n n n1 ! converges.

It needs just a little work: Set u n 1 then substitute: lim lim lim lim n n uu u uu nu uu 1 1 11 1 11 11 1 1 1 1 1 ee Because this is less than one, the series converges. 18 n n n 1 3 4 converges. Rewrite this so it’s one big nth power: n n n n 1 1 3 4 / .

Thus the series diverges. 21 n n n n1 1 1 1 31 diverges. This one is a no-brainer, because lim n n n 1 31 1 3 , the first condition of the alternating series test, is not satisfied, which means that both the alternating series and the series of positive terms are divergent. CHAPTER 19 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits 615 22 n n n n3 21 1 2 converges conditionally. Check the two conditions of the alternating series test: 1. Does the limit equal zero? lim lim () n n n n n 1 2 1 2 0 2 LH pitals rule Check. ’ô ’ 2. Are the terms non-increasing? n n n n n n n nn nn n 1 2 11 12 1 2 2 21 12 1 22 22 2 ? ? ?? ? ? nn nn nn nn nn nn nn 22 22 12 24 31 2 2 32 23 2 32 3 nnn nn 2 2 24 33 0 Check. (Extra credit question: Do you see why the above inequality math is a bit loose? It is valid, however.) Thus, the series is at least conditionally convergent. And it is easy to show that it is only conditionally convergent and not absolutely convergent by the direct comparison test. Each term of the given series, n n n3 2 1 2 , is greater than the corresponding term of the series n n n3 2 , because each term of n n n3 2 1 2 has a larger numerator and a smaller denominator. Since n n n3 2 is the same as the divergent harmonic series, n n3 1 , it follows that n n n3 2 1 2 is divergent as well.

Use some simple algebra to rewrite the fraction (always consider taking a fraction apart like this): nn n n n n nnn 2 1 22 1 n n n n n n nn nn 2 1 2 1 1 32 1 11 The first series is the harmonic series, which diverges to infinity; the second is a p-series with p 3 2, so it converges. Thus, the original series diverges. 2 2 89 2 1 n nnn diverges to infinity. Always ask yourself whether you can easily integrate the series expression, because if you can, the integral comparison test is a snap. The derivative of the denominator is 2 8n . If that were in the numerator, you’d be all set for a simple u-substitution. Like with Problem 1, some simple algebra does the trick — just add and subtract the same thing from the numer- ator (a handy trick to remember): 2 89 28 8 89 28 89 8 89 2 1 2 1 22 n nn n nn n nn nnnnn 11 2 1 2 1 28 89 8 89 n nn nnnn For the first series, compare it to the improper integral 28 89 2 1 x xx dx, which you can solve with a u-substitution (u xx 2 89): (If you remember 28 89 2 1 18 18 x xx dx du u du uc c lim tthis improper integral from Ch. 18, you can stop here; you know it diverges.) lim lim ln ln ln c c cu c 18 18 Because 28 89 2 1 x xx dx diverges to infinity, so does 28 89 2 1 n nnn . For the second series, pull the 8 to the outside: 8 89 8 1 89 2 1 2 1nn nnnn . Now you’ve got a series where each term is less than the convergent p-series (with p 2), so your series con- verges as well, and 8 times that series still converges. 618 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series Infinity plus a finite number equals infinity, so the original series diverges. I wanted to show you the above algebra trick, so I did the problem with the integral compari- son test. But you can do the problem more quickly with the limit comparison test. Give it a try. 3 nn n n n 3 1 ! converges.

Use the direct comparison test: sin2 n is always greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to 1. Thus, each term of the given series is greater than or equal to each term of the divergent harmonic series, and, therefore, it also diverges. Congrats if you noticed the potential problem that the denominator might equal zero, which would throw a wrench into the works (always be on the lookout for this). No worries: sin2 x is only zero at multiples of pi, and no positive integer value of n can ever be equal to a multiple of pi. (Multiples of pi, of course, are always irrational numbers which, when written in deci- mal form, never end.) CHAPTER 19 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits 619 5 1 2 1 ln ln n nnn converges. This resembles a series, 1 2n , that you should know converges, so you might guess that it con- verges as well. But the direct comparison test fails because the given series is greater than the convergent 1 2n series. The ratio test also fails, because the limit equals 1. Next, you might try the limit comparison test with 1 2n as your benchmark series. The limit equals infinity. Strike three — but you’re not out! Try the limit comparison test again, but with a larger convergent series as your benchmark series, 1 32n .

Finally, the fact that this limit is zero means that the given series is infinitely smaller than the convergent benchmark series, so the given series must converge as well. (I had to use the “Okay, so I’m a rebel” tip at the end of the subsection, “The limit comparison test.” This common-sense tip is perfectly sound, but your calc prof might not buy it.) 6 1 2 1 e ne n n n diverges to infinity. Don’t forget to use the nth term test! It’s easy to show that lim n n n e ne 1 1 2 (use L’Hôpital’s rule three times). Because the nth term does not converge to zero, the series diverges. 620 UNIT 5 Integration and Infinite Series 7 1 2 nnn ln diverges to infinity. Use the limit comparison test (sort of) with the harmonic series as your benchmark series: lim ln lim ln lim ln lim n n n n nn n n nn n n n n 1 1 1 2 1 ((by rule)LH pitals’ô ’ lim n n 2 The given series is, thus, infinitely greater than the divergent harmonic series, so it must diverge as well. The reason I wrote “sort of” is that to get this result, I had to use the “Okay, so I’m a rebel” tip again. 8 1 2 n n nlog converges conditionally. This series meets the requirements of the alternating series test, so it converges. Next, you have to consider the ordinary, positive series: 1 2 log nn . That series diverges by the direct comparison test — using the harmonic series as your benchmark series. (As you have proba- bly noticed, the harmonic series is one of the most useful — perhaps the most useful — benchmark series.) Because the series of positive terms diverges, the given alternating series converges conditionally. 9 log n nn 1 diverges to infinity. This is a snap with the direct comparison test. Each term of the given series is greater than or equal to the corresponding term of the diver- gent harmonic series (for all n 10), so this series diverges as well. Don’t forget: You are always free to disregard any number of initial terms. 10 log ln n nn 2 diverges to infinity. Don’t forget to use pre-calc! log ln log. n n e 0 434 for all values of n by the change of base rule. Thus, the series sums to infinity times that value, which, of course, is infinity. The series also diverges by the nth term test. 11 log 33 3 1 n nn converges. Use the very same approach as with Problem 5: CHAPTER 19 Infinite Series: Welcome to the Outer Limits 621 You can use the limit comparison test with the known benchmark series, 1 2n . (The test will fail if you use the smaller benchmark series, 1 3n .) lim log lim log lim log n n n n n n n n n n 33 3 2 33 23 3 1 3 1 33 1 2n (by rule; the derivative is a nestedLH pitals’ô ’ chain rule problem) lim log lim log n n n n n n 9 18 1 3 23 3 3 nn n nn n 2 3 1 54 5 ( rule again)LH pitals’ô ’ lim log lim 44 1 3 1 162 0 3 2 n n nn ( rule yet again)LH pitals’ô ’ lim Just like with Problem 5, this zero result tells you that the given series converges. And the same caveat as you see at the end of the Problem 5 solution applies here. 12 e n n 1 1 converges to e e 1 497. . Congrats if you saw that this one is a geometric series in disguise. You can rewrite this in standard geometric series format, ar n n 0 : e en nn n 1 10 1 0 1 1 e , so, by the geometric series rule, this series converges to 1 1 1 497 e e e . .

He runs The Math Center in Winnetka, Illinois (www. themathcenter.com), a one-man math teaching and tutoring business; he helps students with all junior high and high school math courses, including calculus and statistics as well as ACT, PSAT, and SAT preparation. In high school, Ryan twice scored a perfect 800 on the math por- tion of the SAT, and he not only knows mathematics, he also has a gift for explaining it in plain English. He practiced law for four years before deciding he should do something he enjoys and use his natural talent for mathematics. Calculus All-in-One For Dummies is Mark Ryan’s twelfth book. His first book, Everyday Math for Everyday Life (Grand Central Publishing), was published in 2002. For Wiley, Calculus For Dummies, 1st Edition, was published in 2003; Calculus Workbook For Dummies, 1st Edition, in 2005; Geometry Workbook For Dummies in 2007; Geometry For Dummies, 2nd Edition, in 2008; Calculus Essentials For Dummies in 2010; Geometry Essentials For Dummies in 2011; Calculus For Dummies, 2nd Edition, in 2014; Calculus Workbook For Dummies, 2nd Edition, in 2015; Geometry For Dummies, 3rd Edition, in 2016; and Calculus Workbook For Dummies, 3rd Edition, in 2018. Ryan’s math books have sold over 850,000 copies. Ryan lives in Evanston, Illinois. For fun, he hikes, skies, plays platform tennis, travels, plays on a pub trivia team, and roots for the Chicago Blackhawks. Dedication To my current and former math students. Through teaching them, they taught me. Author’s Acknowledgments I’m very grateful to my agent, Sheree Bykofsky, and her staff for all their efforts, which ultimately resulted in my writing the first edition of Calculus For Dummies for Wiley Publishing in 2003. Many thanks, Sheree. This book is a testament to the high standards of everyone at Wiley. I’ve worked for many years with executive editor Lindsay Berg. She’s intelligent, professional, down-to-earth, and has a great sense of humor. She always has an empathetic and quick understanding of my concerns as an author. And she has a special way of dealing with my oh-so-minor personal- ity foibles with patience, skill, and finesse. It’s always a pleasure to work with her. Chrissy Guthrie, editorial project manager and development editor extraordinaire, managed all phases of this complicated project, from the minor details to the big picture, with skill, efficiency, and intelligence. Marylouise Wiack, copy editor, has been invaluable in proofreading and editing the extremely complicated mathematics in the book. She has a great eye for detail and preci- sion. Kristie Pyles, senior managing editor, and Kelsey Baird, managing editor, managed the production schedule and page proofs process. Toy Simmons, technical editor, did an excellent job checking the thousands of equations in the book. She’s a calculus expert with a great eye for spotting errors. I’ve done four books with development editor Tim Gallan. He’s a very talented and experienced editor who has a deft touch with the many aspects of taking a book from start to finish. These talented editors understand the forest, the trees, when to edit, and when not to edit. The layout and graphics team at Straive did a fantastic job with the book’s complex equa- tions and mathematical figures. Derrick Fimon and others at Wiris were a big help in bringing me up to speed in the use of MathType. (Wiris has great technical support.) This is an enormous undertaking; I’m grateful for this great team of talented professionals. Many thanks to my bright, professional, and computer-savvy assistants, Benjamin Mumford, Randy Claussen, and Caroline DeVane. Josh Dillon did a meticulous review of the mathemat- ics in the book. He knows calculus and how to communicate it clearly. And thanks to another assistant of mine, the multi-talented Amanda Wasielewski. A special thanks to my brother-in-law, Steve Mardiks, and my friends Abby Lombardi, Ted Lowitz, and Barry Sullivan for their valuable advice, editing, and support. My friend, Beverly Wright, psychoacoustician and writer extraordinaire, was a big help with my contract negotia- tions. She gave me astute and much-needed advice and was generous with her time. Lastly, I’m grateful to my business advisor, Josh Lowitz. His insights into my writing career and my teaching and tutoring business have made him invaluable. His accessibility might make you think I was his only client instead of one of a couple dozen.
