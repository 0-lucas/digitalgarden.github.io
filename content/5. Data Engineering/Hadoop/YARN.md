# What is it?

*YARN*, which stands for *Yet Another Resource Negotiator*, is a [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]] component, often called the *brain of [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]]*. It controls all other components, **distributes workloads**, **schedules tasks**, and **decouples data processing** from resource management.
