# What is it?

In [[Software Engineering]], most [[Process Models|process models]] are better used when the **software and its context is correspondent to the model** itself. [[Process Models|Process models]] itself are **very hard to be universal** and to work for every possible software and business.

However, *RUP*, which stands for *Rational Unified Process*, was created with this exact thought in mind: **to be a universal, flexible and hybrid [[Process Models|process model]]**.

# RUP phases

*RUP* has four main phases, which are:

- ### Inception
	This phase gathers all information about **user's requirements**, **potential risks**, and **contribution of the project to the business**. In other words, it's about understanding **what is being developed and for what**.
	
- ### Elaboration
	This phase analyze the requirements to **design the system architecture**and **features**, also planning how it's going to **work in the insides.** In other words, it's about understanding **how it will be developed**.

- ### Construction
	This phase is about **creating a prototype of the product**. Most development will be done here, **building the product in ascending iterations** until most of the product is done.

- ### Transition
	After the product is operational and ready to be used, it should be **deployed to the user**, being **strategically introduced to its end user**.

# Workflows in RUP

For each of the four phases demonstrated above, the *RUP model* also presents a workflow of
