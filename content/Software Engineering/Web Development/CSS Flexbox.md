# What is it?

The [[CSS]] *Flexible Box Module*, also called *flexbox* for short, allowing users to align and position elements in a way that they **behave predictably when the page layout needs to accommodate different screen sizes**.

*Flexbox* **shrinks and expands elements** depending on the **available space** on the [[HTML]] page layout based on a **one-dimensional layout**.

# Creating flexbox layouts

The *flex container* is created using the property `display:flex`.
