# What is it?
*CSS* stands for *Cascading Styling Sheets*, and in [[Web Development]], it's used with [[HTML]] to **create the design and visual style of web pages**. While [[HTML]] defines the bare bones structure, *CSS* adds all **visual cues**, **layout**, and **animations**.

>[!tip] Creating *CSS* files
>We can work with *CSS* **inside** [[HTML]] files, defining the structure along with the style, or **create an *external stylesheet*** to use as **reference** in a *.html* file.
>
>To **create an standalone *CSS* file**, create a **text file** ending with the ***.css* extension**.
