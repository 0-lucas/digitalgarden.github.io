# What is it?

Any company that adopts [[Data Engineering]] should also have a *data governance* strategy, which **include the people**, **processes**, and **technologies** needed to guarantee that the **data is comprehensible**, **complete**, **accurate**, **secure** and **detectable**. In other words, it focuses on **quality**, **security**, and **availability**.

# The topics of Data Governance

According to *Rosangela Marquesone*, in her [[Livro de Big Data - Tecnicas extracao de valor dos dados.pdf|book]] about [[Big Data]], the main topics of a *data governance* strategy are:

- ##### Data Architecture
	The *chosen architecture* defines how data will be **stored across the organization**. The underlying infrastructure should be **updated**, **maintained**, and **suffice** the organization needs.

- ##### Audit
	A effective *data governance* strategy should allow for **tracking when the data is created**, **modified** and **how it's being used**, being possible to know **where the data is impacting the organization**, and **which teams are using**.

- ##### Metadata Management
	*Metadata* will be used by the *governance team* to **contextualize** and **standardize** all data. It can be both **technical** information and **business-oriented** information.

- ##### Master Data Management â€” MDM
	In [[Big Data]], [[Types of Data|unstructured data]] is captured and stored in its **original format**, which can **make it difficult** for analysts and developers to use it. The *MDM* initiative tries to create [[Types of Data|structured databases]] **from the original data**, making it **easier and more accessible to users**.

- ##### Data Modelling
	The various [[Types of Data|types of data]] of a organization need **various types of databases** and ***data modelling strategies***. These need to share a **common ground**, with **standard attributes**.

- ##### Data Quality
	While the *MDM* data should always be the **most accurate possible**, *quality strategies* should be **applied to all data in a organization**. **Profiling**, **cleaning**, **filtering**, and **grouping** should be a **culture across the organization**, not only the team behind *MDM*.

- ##### Security
	Data should be secured physically, technically, and administratively. *Risk management* related to **extraction**, **storage**, **access**, **processing** and **analysis of data** should be applied to all data.
