# What is it?

In [[Mathematics]], *Manhattan distance*, also known as *L2 distance* in [[Machine Learning]], is a distance measure which can be defined as the **sum of the absolute differences between two points** in a plane.

It's mathematically represented as:
$$
d = |x_{i} -x_{j}| + |y_{i} - y_{j}|
$$
