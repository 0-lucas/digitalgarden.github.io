# What is it?

*Algorithms* are procedures done **step-by-step** to solve a problem. These steps need to be **finite** and contain **well-defined instructions**, from which an **input will be converted to a desirable output**.

Think of an *algorithm* like following a recipe. In the end, *algorithms* are just a **list of instructions**, used to solve a problem.
