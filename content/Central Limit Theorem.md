# What is it?

The *Central Limit Theorem* is a important **[[Limits|limit]] theorem** in [[Statistics]] and [[Probability]], which creates the base for **assuming characteristics from a sample to the entire population**, along with the [[Law of Large Numbers]].

The idea is that the **sum of a large number of averages is approximately normal**, given some assumptions. So for an unknown variable, one could use the *central limit theorem* to analyze it as a [[Normal Distribution]], which opens up various different methods to apply, like [[ANOVA]].

# Assumptions of the theorem

In order to apply the *central limit theorem*, some conditions must be met:

- ##### The variable must be *i.i.d.* - independent and identically distributed.
- ##### The population's distribution must have **finite variance**.
- ##### Sampling must be random and sufficiently large. The rule of thumb is $n \geq 30$,
- ##### Some statisticians also say that the sample size cannot be greater than 10% of the population.

# Applying the theorem

It's possible to apply the *central limit theorem* to any variable that **comply with the assumptions** above. The **original distribution of the variable doesn't really matter** as long as it follows the assumptions. 

Even though one can apply the *central limit theorem* conceptually,
