# What is it?

In [[Mathematics]] and [[Linear Algebra]], a *homogeneous system* is a [[Linear Systems|linear system]] which the right hand of every *linear equation* is equal to $0$. 
This can be defined mathematically as $Ax = b / b = 0$, where $A$ is the *[[Matrices|matrix]] of coefficients*, $x$ is the *unknown [[Vectors|vector]]*, and $b$ is the *known [[Vectors|vector]], the value after the equal sign.

$$
\begin{cases}
6x - y + 5.25z = 0 \\
-2x + y + 10z = 0 \\
+9x -5y - 4z = 0
\end{cases} 
\qquad
\text{rewritten as} \qquad
\begin{pmatrix}
6 & -1 & 5.25 &  | 0\\
-2 & 1 & 10  & | 0\\
9 & -5 & -4 & |0
\end{pmatrix}

# Solutions of homogeneous systems

A *homogeneous system* can have have **two types of solutions**, the *trivial* and *non-trivial solution*.

- ##### Trivial solution
	The system always has a *trivial solution*, where the **value of each variable is equal to $0$**. This solution **can happen to every *homogeneous system***.

- ##### Non-trivial solution
	The value of **a least one variable is not equal to $0$**, even if it depends on the value **of another variable**. It can **only happen when the number of equations is less than the number of variables**.
