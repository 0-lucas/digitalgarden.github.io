# What is it?

*Descriptive Statistics* is a sub-field of [[Statistics]], focused on **methods to summarize and describe** a dataset, **measuring data and getting valuable information** that can identify patterns and relationships.

# Sampling techniques

The set of elements which will be **studied a certain characteristic from** is called *population*, which encompasses the entire dataset. In practice, it's not viable to study the entire *population*, so statisticians **opt to study just a subset** of said *population*. This subset is called *sample*.

>[!tip] The difference between sample and population
> *Population* refers to the **entire data**. *Sample* is any **subset of the data**.

The process of extracting a *sample* from a *population* can yield bad *samples* that can **bias the analysis**. Because of it, we use ***sampling techniques* to collect representative samples** of the population.

## Intentional sampling

*Intentional sampling* methods are **non-randomized and non-probabilistic procedures**, which results in a **biased sample**. The purpose of *intentional sampling* is to **deliberately select a group of elements which satisfy specific prescribed criteria**. 

It should be used only with **enough previous knowledge of the population**.
___
## Simple random sampling

To perform a *simple random sampling*, each element from the *population* **receives a number** from $1$ to $n$, and to collect a sample with size $x$, **draw random numbers** corresponding to the elements, **with or without reposition**.
