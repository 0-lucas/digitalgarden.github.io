# What is it?

The *layered* [[Architecture Patterns|architecture pattern]] is an **abstraction representation of a system**, where each layer represents a functionality. *External layers* represent **visible and interface components** and *internal layers* represent the **back-end processing**.

A *layered architecture* can have **multiple layers**, from simple systems with three layers to complex system with multiple ones.
The most common way to represent *layered architectures* is to abstract into three layers, with *user interface*, *business logic* and *database*.

However, complex systems can isolate other components into other layers:
