# What is it?

*Integration* is to [[Integrals]] the same [[Differentiation]] is to [[Derivatives]]. Both involve shrink a number down to its infinitesimal scale to calculate something. In the case of *Integration*, they are the about **adding up infinitesimal pieces of something** and **calculating the area under a curve**.

The objective of *integration* is to discover the [[Integrals|integral]] of a function, also commonly named as *antiderivative* and *primitive function*. In other words, if you have a derivative $f'(x)$, the original function $f(x)$ is our *antiderivative*, the function *integration* wants to discover.
