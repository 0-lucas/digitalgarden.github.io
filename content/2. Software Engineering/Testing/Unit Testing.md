# What is it?

In [[Software Testing]], *unit tests* are the most basic [[Software Testing|testing method]] used, which consists of **validating** an **individual component of the software**, accordingly to **functionality** and [[Requirements|requirements]]. This small component can be a *function* or a *method*.

This way, **bugs can be detected and fixed early** in the development process, ensuring that **each part of the code works correctly** before connecting to other units and implementing the entire system.
