# What is it?

A *graph* is a **non-linear** [[Data Structures|data structure]] consisting of *vertices* and *edges*. A *graph* can be thought of as a [[Binary Trees|binary tree]] with **no hierarchy**. This way, **any element can be connected to another**, granting more flexibility.

*Vertices*, also referred as *nodes*, contain **relevant data**, or are just **points of interest** to the application.
*Edges* are used to **connect two *nodes*** of the *graph*, in **any possible way**.
