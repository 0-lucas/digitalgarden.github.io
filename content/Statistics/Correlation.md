# What is it?

*Correlation* is a [[Statistical Measure]] that measures the **direction and strength** of the **linear relationship** between two numerical variables, meaning these two variables **change together at a constant rate**. 

*Correlation* is a great for **describing simple relationships** between variables without making a statement about cause and effect. Even though two variables can be highly correlated, **it doesn't imply causation**.

# Notation and Definition

The first thing to have in mind when thinking about **correlated variables**, is that the concept of *correlation* **applies only to linear relationships**. More complex, non-**linear relationships** are **not explained by correlation**. 

*Correlation* is used in numerical format through a *correlation coefficient*, which is a [[Statistical Measure]] with values ranging from $-1$ to $+1$, normally written as $r$.
There are two common ways to calculate a *correlation coefficient*, being []
