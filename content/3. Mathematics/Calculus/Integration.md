# What is it?

*Integration* is to [[Integrals]] the same [[Differentiation]] is to [[Derivatives]]. Both involve shrink a number down to its infinitesimal scale to calculate something. In the case of *Integration*, they are the about **adding up infinitesimal pieces of something** and **calculating the area under a curve**.

The objective of *integration* is to discover the [[Integrals|integral]] of a function, also commonly named as *antiderivative* and *primitive function*. In other words, if you have a derivative $f'(x)$, the original function $f(x)$ is our *antiderivative*, the function *integration* wants to discover.

# Integration Rules

[[Calculus]]' *first fundamental theorem* states that **the integral of a derivative of a function, is the function itself**, except for a **constant value**.  Because of it, the rules used in [[Differentiation]] can be applied to *integration*, just in reverse. 

For example, the *Power Rule* in [[Differentiation]] can also be applied to *integration*, but instead of subtracting, you add the exponent.
$$
f'(x^2) =2x\quad \text{and} \quad\int(2x)dx = 2x$$
