Laura and John Arnold Foundation (LJAF) actively seeks opportunities to invest in organizations and thought leaders that have a sincere interest in implementing fundamental changes that not only yield immediate gains, but also repair broken systems for future generations. LJAF currently focuses its strategic investments on education, criminal justice, research integrity, and public accountability. The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation has been making grants since 1967 to help solve social and environmental problems at home and around the world. The Foundation concentrates its resources on activities in education, the environment, global development and population, performing arts, and philanthropy, and makes grants to support disadvantaged communities in the San Francisco Bay Area. Calvin K. Kazanjian was the founder and president of Peter Paul (Almond Joy), Inc. He firmly believed that the more people understood about basic economics the happier and more prosperous they would be. Accordingly, he established the Calvin K. Kazanjian Economics Foundation Inc, in 1949 as a philanthropic, nonpolitical educational organization to support efforts that enhanced economic understanding. Guided by the belief that every life has equal value, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation works to help all people lead healthy, productive lives. In developing countries, it focuses on improving people’s health with vaccines and other life-saving tools and giving them the chance to lift themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty. In the United States, it seeks to significantly improve education so that all young people have the opportunity to reach their full potential. Based in Seattle, Washington, the foundation is led by CEO Jeff Raikes and Co-chair William H. Gates Sr., under the direction of Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett. The Maxfield Foundation supports projects with potential for high impact in science, education, sustainability, and other areas of social importance.

Coverage and scope Chapter 1 Sampling and Data Chapter 2 Descriptive Statistics Chapter 3 Probability Topics Chapter 4 Discrete Random Variables Chapter 5 Continuous Random Variables Chapter 6 The Normal Distribution Chapter 7 The Central Limit Theorem Chapter 8 Confidence Intervals Chapter 9 Hypothesis Testing with One Sample Chapter 10 Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples Chapter 11 The Chi-Square Distribution Chapter 12 Linear Regression and Correlation Chapter 13 F Distribution and One-Way ANOVA Preface 1 Alternate sequencing Introductory Statistics was conceived and written to fit a particular topical sequence, but it can be used flexibly to accommodate other course structures. One such potential structure, which fits reasonably well with the textbook content, is provided below. Please consider, however, that the chapters were not written to be completely independent, and that the proposed alternate sequence should be carefully considered for student preparation and textual consistency. Chapter 1 Sampling and Data Chapter 2 Descriptive Statistics Chapter 12 Linear Regression and Correlation Chapter 3 Probability Topics Chapter 4 Discrete Random Variables Chapter 5 Continuous Random Variables Chapter 6 The Normal Distribution Chapter 7 The Central Limit Theorem Chapter 8 Confidence Intervals Chapter 9 Hypothesis Testing with One Sample Chapter 10 Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples Chapter 11 The Chi-Square Distribution Chapter 13 F Distribution and One-Way ANOVA Pedagogical foundation and features • Examples are placed strategically throughout the text to show students the step-by-step process of interpreting and solving statistical problems. To keep the text relevant for students, the examples are drawn from a broad spectrum of practical topics, including examples about college life and learning, health and medicine, retail and business, and sports and entertainment. • Try It practice problems immediately follow many examples and give students the opportunity to practice as they read the text. They are usually based on practical and familiar topics, like the Examples themselves. • Collaborative Exercises provide an in-class scenario for students to work together to explore presented concepts. • Using the TI-83, 83+, 84, 84+ Calculator shows students step-by-step instructions to input problems into their calculator. • The Technology Icon indicates where the use of a TI calculator or computer software is recommended. • Practice, Homework, and Bringing It Together problems give the students problems at various degrees of difficulty while also including real-world scenarios to engage students. Statistics labs These innovative activities were developed by Barbara Illowsky and Susan Dean in order to offer students the experience of designing, implementing, and interpreting statistical analyses. They are drawn from actual experiments and data-gathering processes and offer a unique hands-on and collaborative experience. The labs provide a foundation for further learning and classroom interaction that will produce a meaningful application of statistics. Statistics Labs appear at the end of each chapter and begin with student learning outcomes, general estimates for time on task, and any global implementation notes. Students are then provided with step-by-step guidance, including sample data tables and calculation prompts. The detailed assistance will help the students successfully apply the concepts in the text and lay the groundwork for future collaborative or individual work.

(credit: David Sim) Introduction Chapter Objectives By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: • Recognize and differentiate between key terms. • Apply various types of sampling methods to data collection. • Create and interpret frequency tables. You are probably asking yourself the question, \"When and where will I use statistics?\" If you read any newspaper, watch television, or use the Internet, you will see statistical information. There are statistics about crime, sports, education, politics, and real estate. Typically, when you read a newspaper article or watch a television news program, you are given sample information. With this information, you may make a decision about the correctness of a statement, claim, or \"fact.\" Statistical methods can help you make the \"best educated guess.\" Since you will undoubtedly be given statistical information at some point in your life, you need to know some techniques for analyzing the information thoughtfully. Think about buying a house or managing a budget. Think about your chosen profession. The fields of economics, business, psychology, education, biology, law, computer science, police science, and early childhood development require at least one course in statistics. Included in this chapter are the basic ideas and words of probability and statistics. You will soon understand that statistics and probability work together. You will also learn how data are gathered and what \"good\" data can be distinguished from \"bad.\" 1.1 | Definitions of Statistics, Probability, and Key Terms The science of statistics deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. We see and use data in our everyday lives. Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data 5 In your classroom, try this exercise. Have class members write down the average time (in hours, to the nearest half- hour) they sleep per night. Your instructor will record the data. Then create a simple graph (called a dot plot) of the data. A dot plot consists of a number line and dots (or points) positioned above the number line. For example, consider the following data: 5; 5.5; 6; 6; 6; 6.5; 6.5; 6.5; 6.5; 7; 7; 8; 8; 9 The dot plot for this data would be as follows: Figure 1.2 Does your dot plot look the same as or different from the example? Why? If you did the same example in an English class with the same number of students, do you think the results would be the same? Why or why not? Where do your data appear to cluster? How might you interpret the clustering? The questions above ask you to analyze and interpret your data. With this example, you have begun your study of statistics. In this course, you will learn how to organize and summarize data. Organizing and summarizing data is called descriptive statistics. Two ways to summarize data are by graphing and by using numbers (for example, finding an average). After you have studied probability and probability distributions, you will use formal methods for drawing conclusions from \"good\" data. The formal methods are called inferential statistics. Statistical inference uses probability to determine how confident we can be that our conclusions are correct. Effective interpretation of data (inference) is based on good procedures for producing data and thoughtful examination of the data. You will encounter what will seem to be too many mathematical formulas for interpreting data. The goal of statistics is not to perform numerous calculations using the formulas, but to gain an understanding of your data. The calculations can be done using a calculator or a computer. The understanding must come from you. If you can thoroughly grasp the basics of statistics, you can be more confident in the decisions you make in life. Probability Probability is a mathematical tool used to study randomness. It deals with the chance (the likelihood) of an event occurring. For example, if you toss a fair coin four times, the outcomes may not be two heads and two tails. However, if you toss the same coin 4,000 times, the outcomes will be close to half heads and half tails. The expected theoretical probability of heads in any one toss is 1 2or 0.5. Even though the outcomes of a few repetitions are uncertain, there is a regular pattern of outcomes when there are many repetitions. After reading about the English statistician Karl Pearson who tossed a coin 24,000 times with a result of 12,012 heads, one of the authors tossed a coin 2,000 times. The results were 996 heads. The fraction 996 2000 is equal to 0.498 which is very close to 0.5, the expected probability. The theory of probability began with the study of games of chance such as poker. Predictions take the form of probabilities. To predict the likelihood of an earthquake, of rain, or whether you will get an A in this course, we use probabilities. Doctors use probability to determine the chance of a vaccination causing the disease the vaccination is supposed to prevent. A 6 Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 stockbroker uses probability to determine the rate of return on a client's investments. You might use probability to decide to buy a lottery ticket or not. In your study of statistics, you will use the power of mathematics through probability calculations to analyze and interpret your data. Key Terms In statistics, we generally want to study a population. You can think of a population as a collection of persons, things, or objects under study. To study the population, we select a sample. The idea of sampling is to select a portion (or subset) of the larger population and study that portion (the sample) to gain information about the population. Data are the result of sampling from a population. Because it takes a lot of time and money to examine an entire population, sampling is a very practical technique. If you wished to compute the overall grade point average at your school, it would make sense to select a sample of students who attend the school. The data collected from the sample would be the students' grade point averages. In presidential elections, opinion poll samples of 1,000–2,000 people are taken. The opinion poll is supposed to represent the views of the people in the entire country. Manufacturers of canned carbonated drinks take samples to determine if a 16 ounce can contains 16 ounces of carbonated drink. From the sample data, we can calculate a statistic. A statistic is a number that represents a property of the sample. For example, if we consider one math class to be a sample of the population of all math classes, then the average number of points earned by students in that one math class at the end of the term is an example of a statistic. The statistic is an estimate of a population parameter. A parameter is a numerical characteristic of the whole population that can be estimated by a statistic. Since we considered all math classes to be the population, then the average number of points earned per student over all the math classes is an example of a parameter. One of the main concerns in the field of statistics is how accurately a statistic estimates a parameter. The accuracy really depends on how well the sample represents the population. The sample must contain the characteristics of the population in order to be a representative sample. We are interested in both the sample statistic and the population parameter in inferential statistics. In a later chapter, we will use the sample statistic to test the validity of the established population parameter. A variable, usually notated by capital letters such as X and Y, is a characteristic or measurement that can be determined for each member of a population. Variables may be numerical or categorical. Numerical variables take on values with equal units such as weight in pounds and time in hours. Categorical variables place the person or thing into a category. If we let X equal the number of points earned by one math student at the end of a term, then X is a numerical variable. If we let Y be a person's party affiliation, then some examples of Y include Republican, Democrat, and Independent. Y is a categorical variable. We could do some math with values of X (calculate the average number of points earned, for example), but it makes no sense to do math with values of Y (calculating an average party affiliation makes no sense). Data are the actual values of the variable. They may be numbers or they may be words. Datum is a single value. Two words that come up often in statistics are mean and proportion. If you were to take three exams in your math classes and obtain scores of 86, 75, and 92, you would calculate your mean score by adding the three exam scores and dividing by three (your mean score would be 84.3 to one decimal place). If, in your math class, there are 40 students and 22 are men and 18 are women, then the proportion of men students is 22 40 and the proportion of women students is 18 40 . Mean and proportion are discussed in more detail in later chapters. NOTE The words \" mean\" and \" average\" are often used interchangeably. The substitution of one word for the other is common practice. The technical term is \"arithmetic mean,\" and \"average\" is technically a center location. However, in practice among non-statisticians, \"average\" is commonly accepted for \"arithmetic mean.\" Example 1.1 Determine what the key terms refer to in the following study. We want to know the average (mean) amount of money first year college students spend at ABC College on school supplies that do not include books. We randomly surveyed 100 first year students at the college. Three of those students spent $150, $200, and $225, respectively. Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data 7 Solution 1.1 The population is all first year students attending ABC College this term. The sample could be all students enrolled in one section of a beginning statistics course at ABC College (although this sample may not represent the entire population). The parameter is the average (mean) amount of money spent (excluding books) by first year college students at ABC College this term. The statistic is the average (mean) amount of money spent (excluding books) by first year college students in the sample. The variable could be the amount of money spent (excluding books) by one first year student. Let X = the amount of money spent (excluding books) by one first year student attending ABC College. The data are the dollar amounts spent by the first year students. Examples of the data are $150, $200, and $225. 1.1 Determine what the key terms refer to in the following study. We want to know the average (mean) amount of money spent on school uniforms each year by families with children at Knoll Academy. We randomly survey 100 families with children in the school. Three of the families spent $65, $75, and $95, respectively. Example 1.2 Determine what the key terms refer to in the following study. A study was conducted at a local college to analyze the average cumulative GPA’s of students who graduated last year. Fill in the letter of the phrase that best describes each of the items below. 1. Population_____ 2. Statistic _____ 3. Parameter _____ 4. Sample _____ 5. Variable _____ 6. Data _____ a) all students who attended the college last year b) the cumulative GPA of one student who graduated from the college last year c) 3.65, 2.80, 1.50, 3.90 d) a group of students who graduated from the college last year, randomly selected e) the average cumulative GPA of students who graduated from the college last year f) all students who graduated from the college last year g) the average cumulative GPA of students in the study who graduated from the college last year Solution 1.2 1. f; 2. g; 3. e; 4. d; 5. b; 6. c 8 Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Example 1.3 Determine what the key terms refer to in the following study. As part of a study designed to test the safety of automobiles, the National Transportation Safety Board collected and reviewed data about the effects of an automobile crash on test dummies. Here is the criterion they used: Speed at which Cars Crashed Location of “drive” (i.e. dummies) 35 miles/hour Front Seat Table 1.1 Cars with dummies in the front seats were crashed into a wall at a speed of 35 miles per hour. We want to know the proportion of dummies in the driver’s seat that would have had head injuries, if they had been actual drivers. We start with a simple random sample of 75 cars. Solution 1.3 The population is all cars containing dummies in the front seat. The sample is the 75 cars, selected by a simple random sample. The parameter is the proportion of driver dummies (if they had been real people) who would have suffered head injuries in the population. The statistic is proportion of driver dummies (if they had been real people) who would have suffered head injuries in the sample. The variable X = the number of driver dummies (if they had been real people) who would have suffered head injuries. The data are either: yes, had head injury, or no, did not. Example 1.4 Determine what the key terms refer to in the following study. An insurance company would like to determine the proportion of all medical doctors who have been involved in one or more malpractice lawsuits. The company selects 500 doctors at random from a professional directory and determines the number in the sample who have been involved in a malpractice lawsuit. Solution 1.4 The population is all medical doctors listed in the professional directory. The parameter is the proportion of medical doctors who have been involved in one or more malpractice suits in the population. The sample is the 500 doctors selected at random from the professional directory. The statistic is the proportion of medical doctors who have been involved in one or more malpractice suits in the sample. The variable X = the number of medical doctors who have been involved in one or more malpractice suits. The data are either: yes, was involved in one or more malpractice lawsuits, or no, was not. Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data 9 Do the following exercise collaboratively with up to four people per group. Find a population, a sample, the parameter, the statistic, a variable, and data for the following study: You want to determine the average (mean) number of glasses of milk college students drink per day. Suppose yesterday, in your English class, you asked five students how many glasses of milk they drank the day before. The answers were 1, 0, 1, 3, and 4 glasses of milk. 1.2 | Data, Sampling, and Variation in Data and Sampling Data may come from a population or from a sample. Lowercase letters like xor ygenerally are used to represent data values. Most data can be put into the following categories: • Qualitative • Quantitative Qualitative data are the result of categorizing or describing attributes of a population. Qualitative data are also often called categorical data. Hair color, blood type, ethnic group, the car a person drives, and the street a person lives on are examples of qualitative data. Qualitative data are generally described by words or letters. For instance, hair color might be black, dark brown, light brown, blonde, gray, or red. Blood type might be AB+, O-, or B+. Researchers often prefer to use quantitative data over qualitative data because it lends itself more easily to mathematical analysis. For example, it does not make sense to find an average hair color or blood type. Quantitative data are always numbers. Quantitative data are the result of counting or measuring attributes of a population. Amount of money, pulse rate, weight, number of people living in your town, and number of students who take statistics are examples of quantitative data. Quantitative data may be either discrete or continuous. All data that are the result of counting are called quantitative discrete data. These data take on only certain numerical values. If you count the number of phone calls you receive for each day of the week, you might get values such as zero, one, two, or three. Data that are not only made up of counting numbers, but that may include fractions, decimals, or irrational numbers, are called quantitative continuous data. Continuous data are often the results of measurements like lengths, weights, or times. A list of the lengths in minutes for all the phone calls that you make in a week, with numbers like 2.4, 7.5, or 11.0, would be quantitative continuous data. Example 1.5 Data Sample of Quantitative Discrete Data The data are the number of books students carry in their backpacks. You sample five students. Two students carry three books, one student carries four books, one student carries two books, and one student carries one book. The numbers of books (three, four, two, and one) are the quantitative discrete data. 1.5 The data are the number of machines in a gym. You sample five gyms. One gym has 12 machines, one gym has 15 machines, one gym has ten machines, one gym has 22 machines, and the other gym has 20 machines. What type of data is this? Example 1.6 Data Sample of Quantitative Continuous Data The data are the weights of backpacks with books in them. You sample the same five students. The weights (in pounds) of their backpacks are 6.2, 7, 6.8, 9.1, 4.3. Notice that backpacks carrying three books can have different 10 Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 weights. Weights are quantitative continuous data. 1.6 The data are the areas of lawns in square feet. You sample five houses. The areas of the lawns are 144 sq. feet, 160 sq. feet, 190 sq. feet, 180 sq. feet, and 210 sq. feet. What type of data is this? Example 1.7 You go to the supermarket and purchase three cans of soup (19 ounces tomato bisque, 14.1 ounces lentil, and 19 ounces Italian wedding), two packages of nuts (walnuts and peanuts), four different kinds of vegetable (broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, and carrots), and two desserts (16 ounces pistachio ice cream and 32 ounces chocolate chip cookies). Name data sets that are quantitative discrete, quantitative continuous, and qualitative. Solution 1.7 One Possible Solution: • The three cans of soup, two packages of nuts, four kinds of vegetables and two desserts are quantitative discrete data because you count them. • The weights of the soups (19 ounces, 14.1 ounces, 19 ounces) are quantitative continuous data because you measure weights as precisely as possible. • Types of soups, nuts, vegetables and desserts are qualitative data because they are categorical. Try to identify additional data sets in this example. Example 1.8 The data are the colors of backpacks. Again, you sample the same five students. One student has a red backpack, two students have black backpacks, one student has a green backpack, and one student has a gray backpack. The colors red, black, black, green, and gray are qualitative data. 1.8 The data are the colors of houses. You sample five houses. The colors of the houses are white, yellow, white, red, and white. What type of data is this? NOTE You may collect data as numbers and report it categorically. For example, the quiz scores for each student are recorded throughout the term. At the end of the term, the quiz scores are reported as A, B, C, D, or F. Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data 11 Example 1.9 Work collaboratively to determine the correct data type (quantitative or qualitative). Indicate whether quantitative data are continuous or discrete. Hint: Data that are discrete often start with the words \"the number of.\" a. the number of pairs of shoes you own b. the type of car you drive c. the distance it is from your home to the nearest grocery store d. the number of classes you take per school year. e. the type of calculator you use f. weights of sumo wrestlers g. number of correct answers on a quiz h. IQ scores (This may cause some discussion.) Solution 1.9 Items a, d, and g are quantitative discrete; items c, f, and h are quantitative continuous; items b and e are qualitative, or categorical. 1.9 Determine the correct data type (quantitative or qualitative) for the number of cars in a parking lot. Indicate whether quantitative data are continuous or discrete. Example 1.10 A statistics professor collects information about the classification of her students as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, or seniors. The data she collects are summarized in the pie chart Figure 1.2. What type of data does this graph show? Figure 1.3 12 Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Solution 1.10 This pie chart shows the students in each year, which is qualitative (or categorical) data. 1.10 The registrar at State University keeps records of the number of credit hours students complete each semester. The data he collects are summarized in the histogram. The class boundaries are 10 to less than 13, 13 to less than 16, 16 to less than 19, 19 to less than 22, and 22 to less than 25. Figure 1.4 What type of data does this graph show? Qualitative Data Discussion Below are tables comparing the number of part-time and full-time students at De Anza College and Foothill College enrolled for the spring 2010 quarter. The tables display counts (frequencies) and percentages or proportions (relative frequencies). The percent columns make comparing the same categories in the colleges easier. Displaying percentages along with the numbers is often helpful, but it is particularly important when comparing sets of data that do not have the same totals, such as the total enrollments for both colleges in this example. Notice how much larger the percentage for part-time students at Foothill College is compared to De Anza College. De Anza College Foothill College Number Percent Number Percent Full-time 9,200 40.9% Full-time 4,059 28.6% Part-time 13,296 59.1% Part-time 10,124 71.4% Total 22,496 100% Total 14,183 100% Table 1.2 Fall Term 2007 (Census day) Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data 13 Tables are a good way of organizing and displaying data. But graphs can be even more helpful in understanding the data. There are no strict rules concerning which graphs to use. Two graphs that are used to display qualitative data are pie charts and bar graphs. In a pie chart, categories of data are represented by wedges in a circle and are proportional in size to the percent of individuals in each category. In a bar graph, the length of the bar for each category is proportional to the number or percent of individuals in each category. Bars may be vertical or horizontal. A Pareto chart consists of bars that are sorted into order by category size (largest to smallest). Look at Figure 1.5 and Figure 1.6 and determine which graph (pie or bar) you think displays the comparisons better. It is a good idea to look at a variety of graphs to see which is the most helpful in displaying the data. We might make different choices of what we think is the “best” graph depending on the data and the context. Our choice also depends on what we are using the data for. (a) (b) Figure 1.5 Figure 1.6 14 Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Percentages That Add to More (or Less) Than 100% Sometimes percentages add up to be more than 100% (or less than 100%). In the graph, the percentages add to more than 100% because students can be in more than one category. A bar graph is appropriate to compare the relative size of the categories. A pie chart cannot be used. It also could not be used if the percentages added to less than 100%. Characteristic/Category Percent Full-Time Students 40.9% Students who intend to transfer to a 4-year educational institution 48.6% Students under age 25 61.0% TOTAL 150.5% Table 1.3 De Anza College Spring 2010 Figure 1.7 Omitting Categories/Missing Data The table displays Ethnicity of Students but is missing the \"Other/Unknown\" category. This category contains people who did not feel they fit into any of the ethnicity categories or declined to respond. Notice that the frequencies do not add up to the total number of students. In this situation, create a bar graph and not a pie chart. Frequency Percent Asian 8,794 36.1% Black 1,412 5.8% Filipino 1,298 5.3% Hispanic 4,180 17.1% Native American 146 0.6% Pacific Islander 236 1.0% White 5,978 24.5% TOTAL 22,044 out of 24,382 90.4% out of 100% Table 1.4 Ethnicity of Students at De Anza College Fall Term 2007 (Census Day) Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data 15 Figure 1.8 The following graph is the same as the previous graph but the “Other/Unknown” percent (9.6%) has been included. The “Other/Unknown” category is large compared to some of the other categories (Native American, 0.6%, Pacific Islander 1.0%). This is important to know when we think about what the data are telling us. This particular bar graph in Figure 1.9 can be difficult to understand visually. The graph in Figure 1.10 is a Pareto chart. The Pareto chart has the bars sorted from largest to smallest and is easier to read and interpret. Figure 1.9 Bar Graph with Other/Unknown Category 16 Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Figure 1.10 Pareto Chart With Bars Sorted by Size Pie Charts: No Missing Data The following pie charts have the “Other/Unknown” category included (since the percentages must add to 100%). The chart in Figure 1.11b is organized by the size of each wedge, which makes it a more visually informative graph than the unsorted, alphabetical graph in Figure 1.11a. (a) (b) Figure 1.11 Sampling Gathering information about an entire population often costs too much or is virtually impossible. Instead, we use a sample of the population. A sample should have the same characteristics as the population it is representing. Most statisticians use various methods of random sampling in an attempt to achieve this goal. This section will describe a few of the most common methods. There are several different methods of random sampling. In each form of random sampling, each member of a population initially has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. Each method has pros and cons. The easiest method to describe is called a simple random sample. Any group of n individuals is equally likely to be chosen as any other group of n individuals if the simple random sampling technique is used. In other words, each sample of the same size has an equal chance of being selected. For example, suppose Lisa wants to form a four-person study group (herself and three other people) from her pre-calculus class, which has 31 members not including Lisa. To choose a simple random sample of size three from the other members of her class, Lisa could put all 31 names in a hat, shake the hat, close her eyes, and pick out three names. A more technological way is for Lisa to first list the last names of the members of her class together with a two-digit number, as in Table 1.5: Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data 17 ID Name ID Name ID Name 00 Anselmo 11 King 21 Roquero 01 Bautista 12 Legeny 22 Roth 02 Bayani 13 Lundquist 23 Rowell 03 Cheng 14 Macierz 24 Salangsang 04 Cuarismo 15 Motogawa 25 Slade 05 Cuningham 16 Okimoto 26 Stratcher 06 Fontecha 17 Patel 27 Tallai 07 Hong 18 Price 28 Tran 08 Hoobler 19 Quizon 29 Wai 09 Jiao 20 Reyes 30 Wood 10 Khan Table 1.5 Class Roster Lisa can use a table of random numbers (found in many statistics books and mathematical handbooks), a calculator, or a computer to generate random numbers. For this example, suppose Lisa chooses to generate random numbers from a calculator. The numbers generated are as follows: 0.94360; 0.99832; 0.14669; 0.51470; 0.40581; 0.73381; 0.04399 Lisa reads two-digit groups until she has chosen three class members (that is, she reads 0.94360 as the groups 94, 43, 36, 60). Each random number may only contribute one class member. If she needed to, Lisa could have generated more random numbers. The random numbers 0.94360 and 0.99832 do not contain appropriate two digit numbers. However the third random number, 0.14669, contains 14 (the fourth random number also contains 14), the fifth random number contains 05, and the seventh random number contains 04. The two-digit number 14 corresponds to Macierz, 05 corresponds to Cuningham, and 04 corresponds to Cuarismo. Besides herself, Lisa’s group will consist of Marcierz, Cuningham, and Cuarismo. To generate random numbers: • Press MATH. • Arrow over to PRB. • Press 5:randInt(. Enter 0, 30). • Press ENTER for the first random number. • Press ENTER two more times for the other 2 random numbers. If there is a repeat press ENTER again. Note: randInt(0, 30, 3) will generate 3 random numbers. 18 Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Figure 1.12 Besides simple random sampling, there are other forms of sampling that involve a chance process for getting the sample. Other well-known random sampling methods are the stratified sample, the cluster sample, and the systematic sample. To choose a stratified sample, divide the population into groups called strata and then take a proportionate number from each stratum. For example, you could stratify (group) your college population by department and then choose a proportionate simple random sample from each stratum (each department) to get a stratified random sample. To choose a simple random sample from each department, number each member of the first department, number each member of the second department, and do the same for the remaining departments. Then use simple random sampling to choose proportionate numbers from the first department and do the same for each of the remaining departments. Those numbers picked from the first department, picked from the second department, and so on represent the members who make up the stratified sample. To choose a cluster sample, divide the population into clusters (groups) and then randomly select some of the clusters. All the members from these clusters are in the cluster sample. For example, if you randomly sample four departments from your college population, the four departments make up the cluster sample. Divide your college faculty by department. The departments are the clusters. Number each department, and then choose four different numbers using simple random sampling. All members of the four departments with those numbers are the cluster sample. To choose a systematic sample, randomly select a starting point and take every nth piece of data from a listing of the population. For example, suppose you have to do a phone survey. Your phone book contains 20,000 residence listings. You must choose 400 names for the sample. Number the population 1–20,000 and then use a simple random sample to pick a number that represents the first name in the sample. Then choose every fiftieth name thereafter until you have a total of 400 names (you might have to go back to the beginning of your phone list). Systematic sampling is frequently chosen because it is a simple method. A type of sampling that is non-random is convenience sampling. Convenience sampling involves using results that are readily available. For example, a computer software store conducts a marketing study by interviewing potential customers who happen to be in the store browsing through the available software. The results of convenience sampling may be very good in some cases and highly biased (favor certain outcomes) in others. Sampling data should be done very carefully. Collecting data carelessly can have devastating results. Surveys mailed to households and then returned may be very biased (they may favor a certain group). It is better for the person conducting the survey to select the sample respondents. True random sampling is done with replacement. That is, once a member is picked, that member goes back into the population and thus may be chosen more than once. However for practical reasons, in most populations, simple random sampling is done without replacement. Surveys are typically done without replacement. That is, a member of the population may be chosen only once. Most samples are taken from large populations and the sample tends to be small in comparison to the population. Since this is the case, sampling without replacement is approximately the same as sampling with replacement because the chance of picking the same individual more than once with replacement is very low. In a college population of 10,000 people, suppose you want to pick a sample of 1,000 randomly for a survey. For any particular sample of 1,000, if you are sampling with replacement, • the chance of picking the first person is 1,000 out of 10,000 (0.1000); • the chance of picking a different second person for this sample is 999 out of 10,000 (0.0999); Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data 19 • the chance of picking the same person again is 1 out of 10,000 (very low). If you are sampling without replacement, • the chance of picking the first person for any particular sample is 1000 out of 10,000 (0.1000); • the chance of picking a different second person is 999 out of 9,999 (0.0999); • you do not replace the first person before picking the next person. Compare the fractions 999/10,000 and 999/9,999. For accuracy, carry the decimal answers to four decimal places. To four decimal places, these numbers are equivalent (0.0999). Sampling without replacement instead of sampling with replacement becomes a mathematical issue only when the population is small. For example, if the population is 25 people, the sample is ten, and you are sampling with replacement for any particular sample, then the chance of picking the first person is ten out of 25, and the chance of picking a different second person is nine out of 25 (you replace the first person). If you sample without replacement, then the chance of picking the first person is ten out of 25, and then the chance of picking the second person (who is different) is nine out of 24 (you do not replace the first person). Compare the fractions 9/25 and 9/24. To four decimal places, 9/25 = 0.3600 and 9/24 = 0.3750. To four decimal places, these numbers are not equivalent. When you analyze data, it is important to be aware of sampling errors and nonsampling errors. The actual process of sampling causes sampling errors. For example, the sample may not be large enough. Factors not related to the sampling process cause nonsampling errors. A defective counting device can cause a nonsampling error. In reality, a sample will never be exactly representative of the population so there will always be some sampling error. As a rule, the larger the sample, the smaller the sampling error. In statistics, a sampling bias is created when a sample is collected from a population and some members of the population are not as likely to be chosen as others (remember, each member of the population should have an equally likely chance of being chosen). When a sampling bias happens, there can be incorrect conclusions drawn about the population that is being studied. Critical Evaluation We need to evaluate the statistical studies we read about critically and analyze them before accepting the results of the studies. Common problems to be aware of include • Problems with samples: A sample must be representative of the population. A sample that is not representative of the population is biased. Biased samples that are not representative of the population give results that are inaccurate and not valid. • Self-selected samples: Responses only by people who choose to respond, such as call-in surveys, are often unreliable. • Sample size issues: Samples that are too small may be unreliable. Larger samples are better, if possible. In some situations, having small samples is unavoidable and can still be used to draw conclusions. Examples: crash testing cars or medical testing for rare conditions • Undue influence: collecting data or asking questions in a way that influences the response • Non-response or refusal of subject to participate: The collected responses may no longer be representative of the population. Often, people with strong positive or negative opinions may answer surveys, which can affect the results. • Causality: A relationship between two variables does not mean that one causes the other to occur. They may be related (correlated) because of their relationship through a different variable. • Self-funded or self-interest studies: A study performed by a person or organization in order to support their claim. Is the study impartial? Read the study carefully to evaluate the work. Do not automatically assume that the study is good, but do not automatically assume the study is bad either. Evaluate it on its merits and the work done. • Misleading use of data: improperly displayed graphs, incomplete data, or lack of context • Confounding: When the effects of multiple factors on a response cannot be separated. Confounding makes it difficult or impossible to draw valid conclusions about the effect of each factor.

Example 1.11 A study is done to determine the average tuition that San Jose State undergraduate students pay per semester. Each student in the following samples is asked how much tuition he or she paid for the Fall semester. What is the type of sampling in each case? a. A sample of 100 undergraduate San Jose State students is taken by organizing the students’ names by classification (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior), and then selecting 25 students from each. b. A random number generator is used to select a student from the alphabetical listing of all undergraduate students in the Fall semester. Starting with that student, every 50th student is chosen until 75 students are included in the sample. c. A completely random method is used to select 75 students. Each undergraduate student in the fall semester has the same probability of being chosen at any stage of the sampling process. d. The freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior years are numbered one, two, three, and four, respectively. A random number generator is used to pick two of those years. All students in those two years are in the sample. e.

Example 1.12 Determine the type of sampling used (simple random, stratified, systematic, cluster, or convenience). a. A soccer coach selects six players from a group of boys aged eight to ten, seven players from a group of boys aged 11 to 12, and three players from a group of boys aged 13 to 14 to form a recreational soccer team. b. A pollster interviews all human resource personnel in five different high tech companies. c. A high school educational researcher interviews 50 high school female teachers and 50 high school male teachers. d. A medical researcher interviews every third cancer patient from a list of cancer patients at a local hospital. e. A high school counselor uses a computer to generate 50 random numbers and then picks students whose names correspond to the numbers. f. A student interviews classmates in his algebra class to determine how many pairs of jeans a student owns, on the average. Solution 1.12 a. stratified; b. cluster; c. stratified; d. systematic; e. simple random; f.convenience 1.12 Determine the type of sampling used (simple random, stratified, systematic, cluster, or convenience). A high school principal polls 50 freshmen, 50 sophomores, 50 juniors, and 50 seniors regarding policy changes for after school activities. If we were to examine two samples representing the same population, even if we used random sampling methods for the samples, they would not be exactly the same. Just as there is variation in data, there is variation in samples. As you become accustomed to sampling, the variability will begin to seem natural. Example 1.13 Suppose ABC College has 10,000 part-time students (the population). We are interested in the average amount of money a part-time student spends on books in the fall term. Asking all 10,000 students is an almost impossible task. Suppose we take two different samples. First, we use convenience sampling and survey ten students from a first term organic chemistry class. Many of these students are taking first term calculus in addition to the organic chemistry class. The amount of money they spend on books is as follows: $128; $87; $173; $116; $130; $204; $147; $189; $93; $153 The second sample is taken using a list of senior citizens who take P.E. classes and taking every fifth senior citizen on the list, for a total of ten senior citizens. They spend: Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data 23 $50; $40; $36; $15; $50; $100; $40; $53; $22; $22 It is unlikely that any student is in both samples. a. Do you think that either of these samples is representative of (or is characteristic of) the entire 10,000 part-time student population? Solution 1.13 a. No. The first sample probably consists of science-oriented students. Besides the chemistry course, some of them are also taking first-term calculus. Books for these classes tend to be expensive. Most of these students are, more than likely, paying more than the average part-time student for their books. The second sample is a group of senior citizens who are, more than likely, taking courses for health and interest. The amount of money they spend on books is probably much less than the average parttime student. Both samples are biased. Also, in both cases, not all students have a chance to be in either sample. b. Since these samples are not representative of the entire population, is it wise to use the results to describe the entire population? Solution 1.13 b. No. For these samples, each member of the population did not have an equally likely chance of being chosen. Now, suppose we take a third sample. We choose ten different part-time students from the disciplines of chemistry, math, English, psychology, sociology, history, nursing, physical education, art, and early childhood development. (We assume that these are the only disciplines in which part-time students at ABC College are enrolled and that an equal number of part-time students are enrolled in each of the disciplines.) Each student is chosen using simple random sampling. Using a calculator, random numbers are generated and a student from a particular discipline is selected if he or she has a corresponding number. The students spend the following amounts: $180; $50; $150; $85; $260; $75; $180; $200; $200; $150 c. Is the sample biased? Solution 1.13 c. The sample is unbiased, but a larger sample would be recommended to increase the likelihood that the sample will be close to representative of the population. However, for a biased sampling technique, even a large sample runs the risk of not being representative of the population. Students often ask if it is \"good enough\" to take a sample, instead of surveying the entire population. If the survey is done well, the answer is yes. 1.13 A local radio station has a fan base of 20,000 listeners. The station wants to know if its audience would prefer more music or more talk shows. Asking all 20,000 listeners is an almost impossible task. The station uses convenience sampling and surveys the first 200 people they meet at one of the station’s music concert events. 24 people said they’d prefer more talk shows, and 176 people said they’d prefer more music. Do you think that this sample is representative of (or is characteristic of) the entire 20,000 listener population? Variation in Data Variation is present in any set of data. For example, 16-ounce cans of beverage may contain more or less than 16 ounces of liquid. In one study, eight 16 ounce cans were measured and produced the following amount (in ounces) of beverage: 15.8; 16.1; 15.2; 14.8; 15.8; 15.9; 16.0; 15.5 Measurements of the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce can may vary because different people make the measurements or because the exact amount, 16 ounces of liquid, was not put into the cans. Manufacturers regularly run tests to determine if 24 Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce can falls within the desired range. Be aware that as you take data, your data may vary somewhat from the data someone else is taking for the same purpose. This is completely natural. However, if two or more of you are taking the same data and get very different results, it is time for you and the others to reevaluate your data-taking methods and your accuracy. Variation in Samples It was mentioned previously that two or more samples from the same population, taken randomly, and having close to the same characteristics of the population will likely be different from each other. Suppose Doreen and Jung both decide to study the average amount of time students at their college sleep each night. Doreen and Jung each take samples of 500 students. Doreen uses systematic sampling and Jung uses cluster sampling. Doreen's sample will be different from Jung's sample. Even if Doreen and Jung used the same sampling method, in all likelihood their samples would be different. Neither would be wrong, however. Think about what contributes to making Doreen’s and Jung’s samples different. If Doreen and Jung took larger samples (i.e. the number of data values is increased), their sample results (the average amount of time a student sleeps) might be closer to the actual population average. But still, their samples would be, in all likelihood, different from each other. This variability in samples cannot be stressed enough. Size of a Sample The size of a sample (often called the number of observations) is important. The examples you have seen in this book so far have been small. Samples of only a few hundred observations, or even smaller, are sufficient for many purposes. In polling, samples that are from 1,200 to 1,500 observations are considered large enough and good enough if the survey is random and is well done. You will learn why when you study confidence intervals. Be aware that many large samples are biased. For example, call-in surveys are invariably biased, because people choose to respond or not. Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data 25 Divide into groups of two, three, or four. Your instructor will give each group one six-sided die. Try this experiment twice. Roll one fair die (six-sided) 20 times. Record the number of ones, twos, threes, fours, fives, and sixes you get in Table 1.7 and Table 1.8 (“frequency” is the number of times a particular face of the die occurs): Face on Die Frequency 1 2 3 4 5 6 Table 1.7 First Experiment (20 rolls) Face on Die Frequency 1 2 3 4 5 6 Table 1.8 Second Experiment (20 rolls) Did the two experiments have the same results? Probably not. If you did the experiment a third time, do you expect the results to be identical to the first or second experiment? Why or why not? Which experiment had the correct results? They both did. The job of the statistician is to see through the variability and draw appropriate conclusions. 1.3 | Frequency, Frequency Tables, and Levels of Measurement Once you have a set of data, you will need to organize it so that you can analyze how frequently each datum occurs in the set. However, when calculating the frequency, you may need to round your answers so that they are as precise as possible. Answers and Rounding Off A simple way to round off answers is to carry your final answer one more decimal place than was present in the original data. Round off only the final answer. Do not round off any intermediate results, if possible. If it becomes necessary to round off intermediate results, carry them to at least twice as many decimal places as the final answer. For example, the average of the three quiz scores four, six, and nine is 6.3, rounded off to the nearest tenth, because the data are whole numbers. Most answers will be rounded off in this manner. 26 Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 It is not necessary to reduce most fractions in this course. Especially in Probability Topics, the chapter on probability, it is more helpful to leave an answer as an unreduced fraction. Levels of Measurement The way a set of data is measured is called its level of measurement. Correct statistical procedures depend on a researcher being familiar with levels of measurement. Not every statistical operation can be used with every set of data. Data can be classified into four levels of measurement. They are (from lowest to highest level): • Nominal scale level • Ordinal scale level • Interval scale level • Ratio scale level Data that is measured using a nominal scale is qualitative(categorical). Categories, colors, names, labels and favorite foods along with yes or no responses are examples of nominal level data. Nominal scale data are not ordered. For example, trying to classify people according to their favorite food does not make any sense. Putting pizza first and sushi second is not meaningful. Smartphone companies are another example of nominal scale data. The data are the names of the companies that make smartphones, but there is no agreed upon order of these brands, even though people may have personal preferences. Nominal scale data cannot be used in calculations. Data that is measured using an ordinal scale is similar to nominal scale data but there is a big difference. The ordinal scale data can be ordered. An example of ordinal scale data is a list of the top five national parks in the United States. The top five national parks in the United States can be ranked from one to five but we cannot measure differences between the data. Another example of using the ordinal scale is a cruise survey where the responses to questions about the cruise are “excellent,” “good,” “satisfactory,” and “unsatisfactory.” These responses are ordered from the most desired response to the least desired. But the differences between two pieces of data cannot be measured. Like the nominal scale data, ordinal scale data cannot be used in calculations. Data that is measured using the interval scale is similar to ordinal level data because it has a definite ordering but there is a difference between data. The differences between interval scale data can be measured though the data does not have a starting point. Temperature scales like Celsius (C) and Fahrenheit (F) are measured by using the interval scale. In both temperature measurements, 40° is equal to 100° minus 60°. Differences make sense. But 0 degrees does not because, in both scales, 0 is not the absolute lowest temperature. Temperatures like -10° F and -15° C exist and are colder than 0. Interval level data can be used in calculations, but one type of comparison cannot be done. 80° C is not four times as hot as 20° C (nor is 80° F four times as hot as 20° F). There is no meaning to the ratio of 80 to 20 (or four to one). Data that is measured using the ratio scale takes care of the ratio problem and gives you the most information. Ratio scale data is like interval scale data, but it has a 0 point and ratios can be calculated. For example, four multiple choice statistics final exam scores are 80, 68, 20 and 92 (out of a possible 100 points). The exams are machine-graded. The data can be put in order from lowest to highest: 20, 68, 80, 92. The differences between the data have meaning. The score 92 is more than the score 68 by 24 points. Ratios can be calculated. The smallest score is 0. So 80 is four times 20. The score of 80 is four times better than the score of 20. Frequency Twenty students were asked how many hours they worked per day. Their responses, in hours, are as follows: 5; 6; 3; 3; 2; 4; 7; 5; 2; 3; 5; 6; 5; 4; 4; 3; 5; 2; 5; 3. Table 1.9 lists the different data values in ascending order and their frequencies. DATA VALUE FREQUENCY 2 3 Table 1.9 Frequency Table of Student Work Hours Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data 27 DATA VALUE FREQUENCY 3 5 4 3 5 6 6 2 7 1 Table 1.9 Frequency Table of Student Work Hours A frequency is the number of times a value of the data occurs. According to Table 1.9, there are three students who work two hours, five students who work three hours, and so on. The sum of the values in the frequency column, 20, represents the total number of students included in the sample. A relative frequency is the ratio (fraction or proportion) of the number of times a value of the data occurs in the set of all outcomes to the total number of outcomes. To find the relative frequencies, divide each frequency by the total number of students in the sample–in this case, 20. Relative frequencies can be written as fractions, percents, or decimals. DATA VALUE FREQUENCY RELATIVE FREQUENCY 2 3 3 20 or 0.15 3 5 5 20 or 0.25 4 3 3 20 or 0.15 5 6 6 20 or 0.30 6 2 2 20 or 0.10 7 1 1 20 or 0.05 Table 1.10 Frequency Table of Student Work Hours with Relative Frequencies The sum of the values in the relative frequency column of Table 1.10 is 20 20 , or 1. Cumulative relative frequency is the accumulation of the previous relative frequencies. To find the cumulative relative frequencies, add all the previous relative frequencies to the relative frequency for the current row, as shown in Table 1.11. DATA VALUE FREQUENCY RELATIVE FREQUENCY CUMULATIVE RELATIVE FREQUENCY 2 3 3 20 or 0.15 0.15 3 5 5 20 or 0.25 0.15 + 0.25 = 0.40 Table 1.11 Frequency Table of Student Work Hours with Relative and Cumulative Relative Frequencies 28 Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 DATA VALUE FREQUENCY RELATIVE FREQUENCY CUMULATIVE RELATIVE FREQUENCY 4 3 3 20 or 0.15 0.40 + 0.15 = 0.55 5 6 6 20 or 0.30 0.55 + 0.30 = 0.85 6 2 2 20 or 0.10 0.85 + 0.10 = 0.95 7 1 1 20 or 0.05 0.95 + 0.05 = 1.00 Table 1.11 Frequency Table of Student Work Hours with Relative and Cumulative Relative Frequencies The last entry of the cumulative relative frequency column is one, indicating that one hundred percent of the data has been accumulated. NOTE Because of rounding, the relative frequency column may not always sum to one, and the last entry in the cumulative relative frequency column may not be one. However, they each should be close to one. Table 1.12 represents the heights, in inches, of a sample of 100 male semiprofessional soccer players.

In this sample, there are five players whose heights fall within the interval 59.95–61.95 inches, three players whose heights fall within the interval 61.95–63.95 inches, 15 players whose heights fall within the interval 63.95–65.95 inches, 40 players whose heights fall within the interval 65.95–67.95 inches, 17 players whose heights fall within the interval 67.95–69.95 inches, 12 players whose heights fall within the interval 69.95–71.95, seven players whose heights fall within the interval 71.95–73.95, and one player whose heights fall within the interval 73.95–75.95. All heights fall between the endpoints of an interval and not at the endpoints. Example 1.14 From Table 1.12, find the percentage of heights that are less than 65.95 inches. Solution 1.14 If you look at the first, second, and third rows, the heights are all less than 65.95 inches. There are 5 + 3 + 15 = 23 players whose heights are less than 65.95 inches. The percentage of heights less than 65.95 inches is then 23 100 or 23%. This percentage is the cumulative relative frequency entry in the third row. 1.14 Table 1.13 shows the amount, in inches, of annual rainfall in a sample of towns.

Is one brand of fertilizer more effective at growing roses than another? Is fatigue as dangerous to a driver as the influence of alcohol? Questions like these are answered using randomized experiments. In this module, you will learn important aspects of experimental design. Proper study design ensures the production of reliable, accurate data. The purpose of an experiment is to investigate the relationship between two variables. When one variable causes change in another, we call the first variable the explanatory variable. The affected variable is called the response variable. In a randomized experiment, the researcher manipulates values of the explanatory variable and measures the resulting changes in the response variable. The different values of the explanatory variable are called treatments. An experimental unit is a single object or individual to be measured. You want to investigate the effectiveness of vitamin E in preventing disease. You recruit a group of subjects and ask them if they regularly take vitamin E. You notice that the subjects who take vitamin E exhibit better health on average than those who do not. Does this prove that vitamin E is effective in disease prevention? It does not. There are many differences Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data 35 between the two groups compared in addition to vitamin E consumption. People who take vitamin E regularly often take other steps to improve their health: exercise, diet, other vitamin supplements, choosing not to smoke. Any one of these factors could be influencing health. As described, this study does not prove that vitamin E is the key to disease prevention. Additional variables that can cloud a study are called lurking variables. In order to prove that the explanatory variable is causing a change in the response variable, it is necessary to isolate the explanatory variable. The researcher must design her experiment in such a way that there is only one difference between groups being compared: the planned treatments. This is accomplished by the random assignment of experimental units to treatment groups. When subjects are assigned treatments randomly, all of the potential lurking variables are spread equally among the groups. At this point the only difference between groups is the one imposed by the researcher. Different outcomes measured in the response variable, therefore, must be a direct result of the different treatments. In this way, an experiment can prove a cause-and-effect connection between the explanatory and response variables. The power of suggestion can have an important influence on the outcome of an experiment. Studies have shown that the expectation of the study participant can be as important as the actual medication. In one study of performance-enhancing drugs, researchers noted: Results showed that believing one had taken the substance resulted in [performance] times almost as fast as those associated with consuming the drug itself. In contrast, taking the drug without knowledge yielded no significant performance increment.[1] When participation in a study prompts a physical response from a participant, it is difficult to isolate the effects of the explanatory variable. To counter the power of suggestion, researchers set aside one treatment group as a control group. This group is given a placebo treatment–a treatment that cannot influence the response variable. The control group helps researchers balance the effects of being in an experiment with the effects of the active treatments. Of course, if you are participating in a study and you know that you are receiving a pill which contains no actual medication, then the power of suggestion is no longer a factor. Blinding in a randomized experiment preserves the power of suggestion. When a person involved in a research study is blinded, he does not know who is receiving the active treatment(s) and who is receiving the placebo treatment. A double-blind experiment is one in which both the subjects and the researchers involved with the subjects are blinded. Example 1.19 Researchers want to investigate whether taking aspirin regularly reduces the risk of heart attack. Four hundred men between the ages of 50 and 84 are recruited as participants. The men are divided randomly into two groups: one group will take aspirin, and the other group will take a placebo. Each man takes one pill each day for three years, but he does not know whether he is taking aspirin or the placebo. At the end of the study, researchers count the number of men in each group who have had heart attacks. Identify the following values for this study: population, sample, experimental units, explanatory variable, response variable, treatments. Solution 1.19 The population is men aged 50 to 84. The sample is the 400 men who participated. The experimental units are the individual men in the study. The explanatory variable is oral medication. The treatments are aspirin and a placebo. The response variable is whether a subject had a heart attack. Example 1.20 The Smell & Taste Treatment and Research Foundation conducted a study to investigate whether smell can affect learning. Subjects completed mazes multiple times while wearing masks. They completed the pencil and paper mazes three times wearing floral-scented masks, and three times with unscented masks. Participants were 1. McClung, M. Collins, D. “Because I know it will!”: placebo effects of an ergogenic aid on athletic performance. Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology. 2007 Jun. 29(3):382-94.

For each trial, researchers recorded the time it took to complete the maze and the subject’s impression of the mask’s scent: positive, negative, or neutral. a. Describe the explanatory and response variables in this study. b. What are the treatments? c. Identify any lurking variables that could interfere with this study. d. Is it possible to use blinding in this study? Solution 1.20 a. The explanatory variable is scent, and the response variable is the time it takes to complete the maze. b. There are two treatments: a floral-scented mask and an unscented mask. c. All subjects experienced both treatments. The order of treatments was randomly assigned so there were no differences between the treatment groups. Random assignment eliminates the problem of lurking variables. d. Subjects will clearly know whether they can smell flowers or not, so subjects cannot be blinded in this study. Researchers timing the mazes can be blinded, though. The researcher who is observing a subject will not know which mask is being worn. Example 1.21 A researcher wants to study the effects of birth order on personality. Explain why this study could not be conducted as a randomized experiment. What is the main problem in a study that cannot be designed as a randomized experiment? Solution 1.21 The explanatory variable is birth order. You cannot randomly assign a person’s birth order. Random assignment eliminates the impact of lurking variables. When you cannot assign subjects to treatment groups at random, there will be differences between the groups other than the explanatory variable. 1.21 You are concerned about the effects of texting on driving performance. Design a study to test the response time of drivers while texting and while driving only. How many seconds does it take for a driver to respond when a leading car hits the brakes? a. Describe the explanatory and response variables in the study. b. What are the treatments? c. What should you consider when selecting participants? d. Your research partner wants to divide participants randomly into two groups: one to drive without distraction and one to text and drive simultaneously. Is this a good idea? Why or why not? e. Identify any lurking variables that could interfere with this study. f. How can blinding be used in this study? Ethics The widespread misuse and misrepresentation of statistical information often gives the field a bad name. Some say that “numbers don’t lie,” but the people who use numbers to support their claims often do. A recent investigation of famous social psychologist, Diederik Stapel, has led to the retraction of his articles from some Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data 37 of the world’s top journals including Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Social Psychology, Basic and Applied Social Psychology, British Journal of Social Psychology, and the magazine Science. Diederik Stapel is a former professor at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. Over the past two years, an extensive investigation involving three universities where Stapel has worked concluded that the psychologist is guilty of fraud on a colossal scale. Falsified data taints over 55 papers he authored and 10 Ph.D. dissertations that he supervised. Stapel did not deny that his deceit was driven by ambition. But it was more complicated than that, he told me. He insisted that he loved social psychology but had been frustrated by the messiness of experimental data, which rarely led to clear conclusions. His lifelong obsession with elegance and order, he said, led him to concoct sexy results that journals found attractive. “It was a quest for aesthetics, for beauty—instead of the truth,” he said. He described his behavior as an addiction that drove him to carry out acts of increasingly daring fraud, like a junkie seeking a bigger and better high.[2] The committee investigating Stapel concluded that he is guilty of several practices including: • creating datasets, which largely confirmed the prior expectations, • altering data in existing datasets, • changing measuring instruments without reporting the change, and • misrepresenting the number of experimental subjects. Clearly, it is never acceptable to falsify data the way this researcher did. Sometimes, however, violations of ethics are not as easy to spot. Researchers have a responsibility to verify that proper methods are being followed. The report describing the investigation of Stapel’s fraud states that, “statistical flaws frequently revealed a lack of familiarity with elementary statistics.”[3] Many of Stapel’s co-authors should have spotted irregularities in his data. Unfortunately, they did not know very much about statistical analysis, and they simply trusted that he was collecting and reporting data properly. Many types of statistical fraud are difficult to spot. Some researchers simply stop collecting data once they have just enough to prove what they had hoped to prove. They don’t want to take the chance that a more extensive study would complicate their lives by producing data contradicting their hypothesis. Professional organizations, like the American Statistical Association, clearly define expectations for researchers. There are even laws in the federal code about the use of research data. When a statistical study uses human participants, as in medical studies, both ethics and the law dictate that researchers should be mindful of the safety of their research subjects. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services oversees federal regulations of research studies with the aim of protecting participants. When a university or other research institution engages in research, it must ensure the safety of all human subjects. For this reason, research institutions establish oversight committees known as Institutional Review Boards (IRB). All planned studies must be approved in advance by the IRB. Key protections that are mandated by law include the following: • Risks to participants must be minimized and reasonable with respect to projected benefits. • Participants must give informed consent. This means that the risks of participation must be clearly explained to the subjects of the study. Subjects must consent in writing, and researchers are required to keep documentation of their consent. • Data collected from individuals must be guarded carefully to protect their privacy. These ideas may seem fundamental, but they can be very difficult to verify in practice. Is removing a participant’s name from the data record sufficient to protect privacy? Perhaps the person’s identity could be discovered from the data that remains. What happens if the study does not proceed as planned and risks arise that were not anticipated? When is informed consent really necessary? Suppose your doctor wants a blood sample to check your cholesterol level. Once the sample has been tested, you expect the lab to dispose of the remaining blood. At that point the blood becomes biological waste. Does a researcher have the right to take it for use in a study? It is important that students of statistics take time to consider the ethical questions that arise in statistical studies. How prevalent is fraud in statistical studies? You might be surprised—and disappointed. There is a website (http://www.retractionwatch.com) dedicated to cataloging retractions of study articles that have been proven 2.

A quick glance will show that the misuse of statistics is a bigger problem than most people realize. Vigilance against fraud requires knowledge. Learning the basic theory of statistics will empower you to analyze statistical studies critically. Example 1.22 Describe the unethical behavior in each example and describe how it could impact the reliability of the resulting data. Explain how the problem should be corrected. A researcher is collecting data in a community. a. She selects a block where she is comfortable walking because she knows many of the people living on the street. b. No one seems to be home at four houses on her route. She does not record the addresses and does not return at a later time to try to find residents at home. c. She skips four houses on her route because she is running late for an appointment. When she gets home, she fills in the forms by selecting random answers from other residents in the neighborhood. Solution 1.22 a. By selecting a convenient sample, the researcher is intentionally selecting a sample that could be biased. Claiming that this sample represents the community is misleading. The researcher needs to select areas in the community at random. b. Intentionally omitting relevant data will create bias in the sample. Suppose the researcher is gathering information about jobs and child care. By ignoring people who are not home, she may be missing data from working families that are relevant to her study. She needs to make every effort to interview all members of the target sample. c. It is never acceptable to fake data. Even though the responses she uses are “real” responses provided by other participants, the duplication is fraudulent and can create bias in the data. She needs to work diligently to interview everyone on her route. 1.22 Describe the unethical behavior, if any, in each example and describe how it could impact the reliability of the resulting data. Explain how the problem should be corrected. A study is commissioned to determine the favorite brand of fruit juice among teens in California. a. The survey is commissioned by the seller of a popular brand of apple juice. b. There are only two types of juice included in the study: apple juice and cranberry juice. c. Researchers allow participants to see the brand of juice as samples are poured for a taste test. d. Twenty-five percent of participants prefer Brand X, 33% prefer Brand Y and 42% have no preference between the two brands. Brand X references the study in a commercial saying “Most teens like Brand X as much as or more than Brand Y.” 1.5 | Data Collection Experiment Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data 39 1.1 Data Collection Experiment Class Time: Names: Student Learning Outcomes • The student will demonstrate the systematic sampling technique. • The student will construct relative frequency tables. • The student will interpret results and their differences from different data groupings.

Once a member of the population is selected for inclusion in a sample, that member is returned to the population for the selection of the next individual. A member of the population may be chosen for inclusion in a sample only once. If chosen, the member is not returned to the population before the next selection. a straightforward method for selecting a random sample; give each member of the population a number.

This module presents important terms that will be used throughout the text. 1.2 Data, Sampling, and Variation in Data and Sampling Data are individual items of information that come from a population or sample. Data may be classified as 46 Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 qualitative(categorical), quantitative continuous, or quantitative discrete. Because it is not practical to measure the entire population in a study, researchers use samples to represent the population. A random sample is a representative group from the population chosen by using a method that gives each individual in the population an equal chance of being included in the sample. Random sampling methods include simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, and systematic sampling. Convenience sampling is a nonrandom method of choosing a sample that often produces biased data. Samples that contain different individuals result in different data. This is true even when the samples are well-chosen and representative of the population. When properly selected, larger samples model the population more closely than smaller samples. There are many different potential problems that can affect the reliability of a sample. Statistical data needs to be critically analyzed, not simply accepted. 1.3 Frequency, Frequency Tables, and Levels of Measurement Some calculations generate numbers that are artificially precise. It is not necessary to report a value to eight decimal places when the measures that generated that value were only accurate to the nearest tenth. Round off your final answer to one more decimal place than was present in the original data. This means that if you have data measured to the nearest tenth of a unit, report the final statistic to the nearest hundredth. In addition to rounding your answers, you can measure your data using the following four levels of measurement. • Nominal scale level: data that cannot be ordered nor can it be used in calculations • Ordinal scale level: data that can be ordered; the differences cannot be measured • Interval scale level: data with a definite ordering but no starting point; the differences can be measured, but there is no such thing as a ratio. • Ratio scale level: data with a starting point that can be ordered; the differences have meaning and ratios can be calculated. When organizing data, it is important to know how many times a value appears. How many statistics students study five hours or more for an exam? What percent of families on our block own two pets? Frequency, relative frequency, and cumulative relative frequency are measures that answer questions like these. 1.4 Experimental Design and Ethics A poorly designed study will not produce reliable data. There are certain key components that must be included in every experiment. To eliminate lurking variables, subjects must be assigned randomly to different treatment groups. One of the groups must act as a control group, demonstrating what happens when the active treatment is not applied. Participants in the control group receive a placebo treatment that looks exactly like the active treatments but cannot influence the response variable. To preserve the integrity of the placebo, both researchers and subjects may be blinded. When a study is designed properly, the only difference between treatment groups is the one imposed by the researcher. Therefore, when groups respond differently to different treatments, the difference must be due to the influence of the explanatory variable. “An ethics problem arises when you are considering an action that benefits you or some cause you support, hurts or reduces benefits to others, and violates some rule.”[4] Ethical violations in statistics are not always easy to spot. Professional associations and federal agencies post guidelines for proper conduct. It is important that you learn basic statistical procedures so that you can recognize proper data analysis. PRACTICE 1.1 Definitions of Statistics, Probability, and Key Terms Use the following information to answer the next five exercises. Studies are often done by pharmaceutical companies to determine the effectiveness of a treatment program. Suppose that a new AIDS antibody drug is currently under study. It is given to patients once the AIDS symptoms have revealed themselves. Of interest is the average (mean) length of time in months patients live once they start the treatment. Two researchers each follow a different set of 40 patients with AIDS from the start of treatment until their deaths. The following data (in months) are collected. 4.

In advance of the 1936 Presidential Election, a magazine titled Literary Digest released the results of an opinion poll predicting that the republican candidate Alf Landon would win by a large margin. The magazine sent post cards to approximately 10,000,000 prospective voters. These prospective voters were selected from the subscription list of the magazine, from automobile registration lists, from phone lists, and from club membership lists. Approximately 2,300,000 people returned the postcards. a. Think about the state of the United States in 1936. Explain why a sample chosen from magazine subscription lists, automobile registration lists, phone books, and club membership lists was not representative of the population of the United States at that time. b. What effect does the low response rate have on the reliability of the sample? c. Are these problems examples of sampling error or nonsampling error? d. During the same year, George Gallup conducted his own poll of 30,000 prospective voters. These researchers used a method they called \"quota sampling\" to obtain survey answers from specific subsets of the population. Quota sampling is an example of which sampling method described in this module? 77. Crime-related and demographic statistics for 47 US states in 1960 were collected from government agencies, including the FBI's Uniform Crime Report.

How does sleep deprivation affect your ability to drive? A recent study measured the effects on 19 professional drivers. Each driver participated in two experimental sessions: one after normal sleep and one after 27 hours of total sleep deprivation. The treatments were assigned in random order. In each session, performance was measured on a variety of tasks including a driving simulation. Use key terms from this module to describe the design of this experiment. 88.

Several online textbook retailers advertise that they have lower prices than on-campus bookstores. However, an important factor is whether the Internet retailers actually have the textbooks that students need in stock. Students need to be able to get textbooks promptly at the beginning of the college term. If the book is not available, then a student would not be able to get the textbook at all, or might get a delayed delivery if the book is back ordered. A college newspaper reporter is investigating textbook availability at online retailers. He decides to investigate one textbook for each of the following seven subjects: calculus, biology, chemistry, physics, statistics, geology, and general engineering. He consults textbook industry sales data and selects the most popular nationally used textbook in each of these subjects. He visits websites for a random sample of major online textbook sellers and looks up each of these seven textbooks to see if they are available in stock for quick delivery through these retailers. Based on his investigation, he writes an article in which he draws conclusions about the overall availability of all college textbooks through online textbook retailers. Write an analysis of his study that addresses the following issues: Is his sample representative of the population of all college textbooks? Explain why or why not. Describe some possible sources of bias in this study, and how it might affect the results of the study. Give some suggestions about what could be done to improve the study.

Even though the difference is not as large as that in the first study, the results from the second study are likely more reliable and still show improvement. 33 Yes, because we cannot tell if the improvement was due to the software or the exercise; the data is confounded, and a reliable conclusion cannot be drawn. New studies should be performed. 35 No, even though the sample is large enough, the fact that the sample consists of volunteers makes it a self-selected sample, which is not reliable. 37 No, even though the sample is a large portion of the population, two responses are not enough to justify any conclusions.

Confounding: There are many factors that define a community other than education level and crime rate. Communities with high crime rates and high education levels may have other lurking variables that distinguish them from communities with lower crime rates and lower education levels. Because we cannot isolate these variables of interest, we cannot draw valid conclusions about the connection between education and crime. Possible lurking variables include police expenditures, unemployment levels, region, average age, and size. 79 a.

The airlines shown with the greatest number of complaints are the ones with the most passengers. You must consider the appropriateness of methods for presenting data; in this case displaying totals is misleading. 91 Answers will vary. Sample answer: The sample is not representative of the population of all college textbooks. Two reasons why it is not representative are that he only sampled seven subjects and he only investigated one textbook in each subject. There are several possible sources of bias in the study. The seven subjects that he investigated are all in mathematics and the sciences; there are many subjects in the humanities, social sciences, and other subject areas, (for example: literature, art, history, psychology, sociology, business) that he did not investigate at all. It may be that different subject areas exhibit different patterns of textbook availability, but his sample would not detect such results. He also looked only at the most popular textbook in each of the subjects he investigated. The availability of the most popular textbooks may differ from the availability of other textbooks in one of two ways: • the most popular textbooks may be more readily available online, because more new copies are printed, and more students nationwide are selling back their used copies OR • the most popular textbooks may be harder to find available online, because more student demand exhausts the supply more quickly. In reality, many college students do not use the most popular textbook in their subject, and this study gives no useful information about the situation for those less popular textbooks. He could improve this study by: • expanding the selection of subjects he investigates so that it is more representative of all subjects studied by college students, and • expanding the selection of textbooks he investigates within each subject to include a mixed representation of both the most popular and less popular textbooks. 66 Chapter 1 | Sampling and Data This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 2 | DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS Figure 2.1 When you have large amounts of data, you will need to organize it in a way that makes sense. These ballots from an election are rolled together with similar ballots to keep them organized. (credit: William Greeson) Introduction Chapter Objectives By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: • Display data graphically and interpret graphs: stemplots, histograms, and box plots. • Recognize, describe, and calculate the measures of location of data: quartiles and percentiles. • Recognize, describe, and calculate the measures of the center of data: mean, median, and mode. • Recognize, describe, and calculate the measures of the spread of data: variance, standard deviation, and range. Once you have collected data, what will you do with it? Data can be described and presented in many different formats. For example, suppose you are interested in buying a house in a particular area. You may have no clue about the house prices, so you might ask your real estate agent to give you a sample data set of prices. Looking at all the prices in the sample often is overwhelming. A better way might be to look at the median price and the variation of prices. The median and variation are just two ways that you will learn to describe data. Your agent might also provide you with a graph of the data. Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics 67 In this chapter, you will study numerical and graphical ways to describe and display your data. This area of statistics is called \"Descriptive Statistics.\" You will learn how to calculate, and even more importantly, how to interpret these measurements and graphs. A statistical graph is a tool that helps you learn about the shape or distribution of a sample or a population. A graph can be a more effective way of presenting data than a mass of numbers because we can see where data clusters and where there are only a few data values. Newspapers and the Internet use graphs to show trends and to enable readers to compare facts and figures quickly. Statisticians often graph data first to get a picture of the data. Then, more formal tools may be applied. Some of the types of graphs that are used to summarize and organize data are the dot plot, the bar graph, the histogram, the stem-and-leaf plot, the frequency polygon (a type of broken line graph), the pie chart, and the box plot. In this chapter, we will briefly look at stem-and-leaf plots, line graphs, and bar graphs, as well as frequency polygons, and time series graphs. Our emphasis will be on histograms and box plots. NOTE This book contains instructions for constructing a histogram and a box plot for the TI-83+ and TI-84 calculators. The Texas Instruments (TI) website (http://education.ti.com/educationportal/sites/US/sectionHome/ support.html) provides additional instructions for using these calculators. 2.1 | Stem-and-Leaf Graphs (Stemplots), Line Graphs, and Bar Graphs One simple graph, the stem-and-leaf graph or stemplot, comes from the field of exploratory data analysis. It is a good choice when the data sets are small. To create the plot, divide each observation of data into a stem and a leaf. The leaf consists of a final significant digit. For example, 23 has stem two and leaf three. The number 432 has stem 43 and leaf two. Likewise, the number 5,432 has stem 543 and leaf two. The decimal 9.3 has stem nine and leaf three. Write the stems in a vertical line from smallest to largest. Draw a vertical line to the right of the stems. Then write the leaves in increasing order next to their corresponding stem. Example 2.1 For Susan Dean's spring pre-calculus class, scores for the first exam were as follows (smallest to largest): 33; 42; 49; 49; 53; 55; 55; 61; 63; 67; 68; 68; 69; 69; 72; 73; 74; 78; 80; 83; 88; 88; 88; 90; 92; 94; 94; 94; 94; 96; 100 Stem Leaf 3 3 4 2 9 9 5 3 5 5 6 1 3 7 8 8 9 9 7 2 3 4 8 8 0 3 8 8 8 9 0 2 4 4 4 4 6 10 0 Table 2.1 Stem-and- Leaf Graph The stemplot shows that most scores fell in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. Eight out of the 31 scores or approximately 68 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 26% ⎛ ⎝ 8 31 ⎞ ⎠were in the 90s or 100, a fairly high number of As. 2.1 For the Park City basketball team, scores for the last 30 games were as follows (smallest to largest): 32; 32; 33; 34; 38; 40; 42; 42; 43; 44; 46; 47; 47; 48; 48; 48; 49; 50; 50; 51; 52; 52; 52; 53; 54; 56; 57; 57; 60; 61 Construct a stem plot for the data. The stemplot is a quick way to graph data and gives an exact picture of the data. You want to look for an overall pattern and any outliers. An outlier is an observation of data that does not fit the rest of the data. It is sometimes called an extreme value. When you graph an outlier, it will appear not to fit the pattern of the graph. Some outliers are due to mistakes (for example, writing down 50 instead of 500) while others may indicate that something unusual is happening. It takes some background information to explain outliers, so we will cover them in more detail later. Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics 69 Example 2.2 The data are the distances (in kilometers) from a home to local supermarkets.

In the particular line graph shown in Example 2.4, the x-axis (horizontal axis) consists of data values and the y-axis (vertical axis) consists of frequency points. The frequency points are connected using line segments. Example 2.4 In a survey, 40 mothers were asked how many times per week a teenager must be reminded to do his or her chores. The results are shown in Table 2.7 and in Figure 2.2.

The bars can be rectangles or they can be rectangular boxes (used in three-dimensional plots), and they can be vertical or horizontal. The bar graph shown in Example 2.5 has age groups represented on the x-axis and proportions on the y-axis. Example 2.5 By the end of 2011, Facebook had over 146 million users in the United States.

One advantage of a histogram is that it can readily display large data sets. A rule of thumb is to use a histogram when the data set consists of 100 values or more. A histogram consists of contiguous (adjoining) boxes. It has both a horizontal axis and a vertical axis. The horizontal axis is labeled with what the data represents (for instance, distance from your home to school). The vertical axis is labeled either frequency or relative frequency (or percent frequency or probability). The graph will have the same shape with either label. The histogram (like the stemplot) can give you the shape of the data, the center, and the spread of the data. The relative frequency is equal to the frequency for an observed value of the data divided by the total number of data values in the sample. (Remember, frequency is defined as the number of times an answer occurs.) If: • f = frequency • n = total number of data values (or the sum of the individual frequencies), and • RF = relative frequency, then: RF= f n For example, if three students in Mr. Ahab's English class of 40 students received from 90% to 100%, then, f = 3, n = 40, and RF = f n= 3 40 = 0.075. 7.5% of the students received 90–100%. 90–100% are quantitative measures. To construct a histogram, first decide how many bars or intervals, also called classes, represent the data. Many histograms consist of five to 15 bars or classes for clarity. The number of bars needs to be chosen. Choose a starting point for the first interval to be less than the smallest data value. A convenient starting point is a lower value carried out to one more decimal place than the value with the most decimal places. For example, if the value with the most decimal places is 6.1 and this is the smallest value, a convenient starting point is 6.05 (6.1 – 0.05 = 6.05). We say that 6.05 has more precision. If the value with the most decimal places is 2.23 and the lowest value is 1.5, a convenient starting point is 1.495 (1.5 – 0.005 = 1.495). If the value with the most decimal places is 3.234 and the lowest value is 1.0, a convenient starting point is 0.9995 (1.0 – 0.0005 = 0.9995). If all the data happen to be integers and the smallest value is two, then a convenient starting point is 1.5 (2 – 0.5 = 1.5). Also, when the starting point and other boundaries are carried to one additional decimal place, no data value will fall on a boundary. The next two examples go into detail about how to construct a histogram using continuous data and how to create a histogram using discrete data. Example 2.7 The following data are the heights (in inches to the nearest half inch) of 100 male semiprofessional soccer players. The heights are continuous data, since height is measured. 60; 60.5; 61; 61; 61.5 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics 77 63.5; 63.5; 63.5 64; 64; 64; 64; 64; 64; 64; 64.5; 64.5; 64.5; 64.5; 64.5; 64.5; 64.5; 64.5 66; 66; 66; 66; 66; 66; 66; 66; 66; 66; 66.5; 66.5; 66.5; 66.5; 66.5; 66.5; 66.5; 66.5; 66.5; 66.5; 66.5; 67; 67; 67; 67; 67; 67; 67; 67; 67; 67; 67; 67; 67.5; 67.5; 67.5; 67.5; 67.5; 67.5; 67.5 68; 68; 69; 69; 69; 69; 69; 69; 69; 69; 69; 69; 69.5; 69.5; 69.5; 69.5; 69.5 70; 70; 70; 70; 70; 70; 70.5; 70.5; 70.5; 71; 71; 71 72; 72; 72; 72.5; 72.5; 73; 73.5 74 The smallest data value is 60. Since the data with the most decimal places has one decimal (for instance, 61.5), we want our starting point to have two decimal places. Since the numbers 0.5, 0.05, 0.005, etc. are convenient numbers, use 0.05 and subtract it from 60, the smallest value, for the convenient starting point. 60 – 0.05 = 59.95 which is more precise than, say, 61.5 by one decimal place. The starting point is, then, 59.95. The largest value is 74, so 74 + 0.05 = 74.05 is the ending value. Next, calculate the width of each bar or class interval. To calculate this width, subtract the starting point from the ending value and divide by the number of bars (you must choose the number of bars you desire). Suppose you choose eight bars. 74.05 − 59.95 8 = 1.76 NOTE We will round up to two and make each bar or class interval two units wide. Rounding up to two is one way to prevent a value from falling on a boundary. Rounding to the next number is often necessary even if it goes against the standard rules of rounding. For this example, using 1.76 as the width would also work. A guideline that is followed by some for the number of bars or class intervals is to take the square root of the number of data values and then round to the nearest whole number, if necessary. For example, if there are 150 values of data, take the square root of 150 and round to 12 bars or intervals. The boundaries are: • 59.95 • 59.95 + 2 = 61.95 • 61.95 + 2 = 63.95 • 63.95 + 2 = 65.95 • 65.95 + 2 = 67.95 • 67.95 + 2 = 69.95 • 69.95 + 2 = 71.95 • 71.95 + 2 = 73.95 • 73.95 + 2 = 75.95 The heights 60 through 61.5 inches are in the interval 59.95–61.95. The heights that are 63.5 are in the interval 61.95–63.95. The heights that are 64 through 64.5 are in the interval 63.95–65.95. The heights 66 through 67.5 are in the interval 65.95–67.95. The heights 68 through 69.5 are in the interval 67.95–69.95. The heights 70 through 71 are in the interval 69.95–71.95. The heights 72 through 73.5 are in the interval 71.95–73.95. The height 74 is in the interval 73.95–75.95. The following histogram displays the heights on the x-axis and relative frequency on the y-axis. 78 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Figure 2.5 2.7 The following data are the shoe sizes of 50 male students. The sizes are continuous data since shoe size is measured. Construct a histogram and calculate the width of each bar or class interval. Suppose you choose six bars. 9; 9; 9.5; 9.5; 10; 10; 10; 10; 10; 10; 10.5; 10.5; 10.5; 10.5; 10.5; 10.5; 10.5; 10.5 11; 11; 11; 11; 11; 11; 11; 11; 11; 11; 11; 11; 11; 11.5; 11.5; 11.5; 11.5; 11.5; 11.5; 11.5 12; 12; 12; 12; 12; 12; 12; 12.5; 12.5; 12.5; 12.5; 14 Example 2.8 Create a histogram for the following data: the number of books bought by 50 part-time college students at ABC College.the number of books bought by 50 part-time college students at ABC College. The number of books is discrete data, since books are counted. 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1 2; 2; 2; 2; 2; 2; 2; 2; 2; 2 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3 4; 4; 4; 4; 4; 4 5; 5; 5; 5; 5 6; 6 Eleven students buy one book. Ten students buy two books. Sixteen students buy three books. Six students buy four books. Five students buy five books. Two students buy six books. Because the data are integers, subtract 0.5 from 1, the smallest data value and add 0.5 to 6, the largest data value. Then the starting point is 0.5 and the ending value is 6.5. Next, calculate the width of each bar or class interval. If the data are discrete and there are not too many different values, a width that places the data values in the middle of the bar or class interval is the most convenient. Since the data consist of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and the starting point is 0.5, a width of one places the 1 in the middle of the interval from 0.5 to 1.5, the 2 in the middle of the interval from 1.5 to 2.5, the 3 in the middle of the interval from 2.5 to 3.5, the 4 in the middle of the interval from _______ to _______, the 5 in the middle of the interval from _______ to _______, and the _______ in the middle of the interval from _______ to _______ .

A value is counted in a class interval if it falls on the left boundary, but not if it falls on the right boundary. Different researchers may set up histograms for the same data in different ways. There is more than one correct way to set up a histogram. 2.9 The following data represent the number of employees at various restaurants in New York City. Using this data, create a histogram. 22; 35; 15; 26; 40; 28; 18; 20; 25; 34; 39; 42; 24; 22; 19; 27; 22; 34; 40; 20; 38; and 28 Use 10–19 as the first interval. Count the money (bills and change) in your pocket or purse. Your instructor will record the amounts. As a class, construct a histogram displaying the data. Discuss how many intervals you think is appropriate. You may want to experiment with the number of intervals. Frequency Polygons Frequency polygons are analogous to line graphs, and just as line graphs make continuous data visually easy to interpret, so too do frequency polygons. To construct a frequency polygon, first examine the data and decide on the number of intervals, or class intervals, to use on the x-axis and y-axis. After choosing the appropriate ranges, begin plotting the data points. After all the points are plotted, 82 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 draw line segments to connect them. Example 2.10 A frequency polygon was constructed from the frequency table below.

This represents an interval extending from 39.5 to 49.5. Since the lowest test score is 54.5, this interval is used only to allow the graph to touch the x-axis. The point labeled 54.5 represents the next interval, or the first “real” interval from the table, and contains five scores. This reasoning is followed for each of the remaining intervals with the point 104.5 representing the interval from 99.5 to 109.5. Again, this interval contains no data and is only used so that the graph will touch the x-axis. Looking at the graph, we say that this distribution is skewed because one side of the graph does not mirror the other side. 2.10 Construct a frequency polygon of U.S. Presidents’ ages at inauguration shown in Table 2.15.

Every day at noon we note the temperature and write this down in a log. A variety of statistical studies could be done with this data. We could find the mean or the median temperature for the month. We could construct a histogram displaying the number of days that temperatures reach a certain range of values. However, all of these methods ignore a portion of the data that we have collected. One feature of the data that we may want to consider is that of time. Since each date is paired with the temperature reading for the day, we don‘t have to think of the data as being random. We can instead use the times given to impose a chronological order on the data. A graph that recognizes this ordering and displays the changing temperature as the month progresses is called a time series graph. Constructing a Time Series Graph To construct a time series graph, we must look at both pieces of our paired data set. We start with a standard Cartesian coordinate system. The horizontal axis is used to plot the date or time increments, and the vertical axis is used to plot the values of the variable that we are measuring. By doing this, we make each point on the graph correspond to a date and a measured quantity. The points on the graph are typically connected by straight lines in the order in which they occur. Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics 85 Example 2.12 The following data shows the Annual Consumer Price Index, each month, for ten years. Construct a time series graph for the Annual Consumer Price Index data only.

Use the table to construct a time series graph for CO2 emissions for the United States.

When recording values of the same variable over an extended period of time, sometimes it is difficult to discern any trend or pattern. However, once the same data points are displayed graphically, some features jump out. Time series graphs make trends easy to spot. 2.3 | Measures of the Location of the Data The common measures of location are quartiles and percentiles Quartiles are special percentiles. The first quartile, Q1, is the same as the 25th percentile, and the third quartile, Q3, is the same as the 75th percentile. The median, M, is called both the second quartile and the 50th percentile. To calculate quartiles and percentiles, the data must be ordered from smallest to largest. Quartiles divide ordered data into quarters. Percentiles divide ordered data into hundredths. To score in the 90th percentile of an exam does not mean, necessarily, that you received 90% on a test. It means that 90% of test scores are the same or less than your score and 10% of the test scores are the same or greater than your test score. Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics 87 Percentiles are useful for comparing values. For this reason, universities and colleges use percentiles extensively. One instance in which colleges and universities use percentiles is when SAT results are used to determine a minimum testing score that will be used as an acceptance factor. For example, suppose Duke accepts SAT scores at or above the 75th percentile. That translates into a score of at least 1220. Percentiles are mostly used with very large populations. Therefore, if you were to say that 90% of the test scores are less (and not the same or less) than your score, it would be acceptable because removing one particular data value is not significant. The median is a number that measures the \"center\" of the data. You can think of the median as the \"middle value,\" but it does not actually have to be one of the observed values. It is a number that separates ordered data into halves. Half the values are the same number or smaller than the median, and half the values are the same number or larger. For example, consider the following data. 1; 11.5; 6; 7.2; 4; 8; 9; 10; 6.8; 8.3; 2; 2; 10; 1 Ordered from smallest to largest: 1; 1; 2; 2; 4; 6; 6.8; 7.2; 8; 8.3; 9; 10; 10; 11.5 Since there are 14 observations, the median is between the seventh value, 6.8, and the eighth value, 7.2. To find the median, add the two values together and divide by two. 6.8 + 7.2 2 = 7 The median is seven. Half of the values are smaller than seven and half of the values are larger than seven. Quartiles are numbers that separate the data into quarters. Quartiles may or may not be part of the data. To find the quartiles, first find the median or second quartile. The first quartile, Q1, is the middle value of the lower half of the data, and the third quartile, Q3, is the middle value, or median, of the upper half of the data. To get the idea, consider the same data set: 1; 1; 2; 2; 4; 6; 6.8; 7.2; 8; 8.3; 9; 10; 10; 11.5 The median or second quartile is seven. The lower half of the data are 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 6, 6.8. The middle value of the lower half is two. 1; 1; 2; 2; 4; 6; 6.8 The number two, which is part of the data, is the first quartile. One-fourth of the entire sets of values are the same as or less than two and three-fourths of the values are more than two. The upper half of the data is 7.2, 8, 8.3, 9, 10, 10, 11.5. The middle value of the upper half is nine. The third quartile, Q3, is nine. Three-fourths (75%) of the ordered data set are less than nine. One-fourth (25%) of the ordered data set are greater than nine. The third quartile is part of the data set in this example. The interquartile range is a number that indicates the spread of the middle half or the middle 50% of the data. It is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). IQR = Q3 – Q1 The IQR can help to determine potential outliers. A value is suspected to be a potential outlier if it is less than (1.5)(IQR) below the first quartile or more than (1.5)(IQR) above the third quartile. Potential outliers always require further investigation. NOTE A potential outlier is a data point that is significantly different from the other data points. These special data points may be errors or some kind of abnormality or they may be a key to understanding the data. Example 2.13 For the following 13 real estate prices, calculate the IQR and determine if any prices are potential outliers. Prices are in dollars. 389,950; 230,500; 158,000; 479,000; 639,000; 114,950; 5,500,000; 387,000; 659,000; 529,000; 575,000; 488,800; 1,095,000 88 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Solution 2.13 Order the data from smallest to largest. 114,950; 158,000; 230,500; 387,000; 389,950; 479,000; 488,800; 529,000; 575,000; 639,000; 659,000; 1,095,000; 5,500,000 M = 488,800 Q1 = 230,500 + 387,000 2 = 308,750 Q3 = 639,000 + 659,000 2 = 649,000 IQR = 649,000 – 308,750 = 340,250 (1.5)(IQR) = (1.5)(340,250) = 510,375 Q1 – (1.5)(IQR) = 308,750 – 510,375 = –201,625 Q3 + (1.5)(IQR) = 649,000 + 510,375 = 1,159,375 No house price is less than –201,625. However, 5,500,000 is more than 1,159,375. Therefore, 5,500,000 is a potential outlier. 2.13 For the following 11 salaries, calculate the IQR and determine if any salaries are outliers. The salaries are in dollars. $33,000; $64,500; $28,000; $54,000; $72,000; $68,500; $69,000; $42,000; $54,000; $120,000; $40,500 Example 2.14 For the two data sets in the test scores example, find the following: a. The interquartile range. Compare the two interquartile ranges. b. Any outliers in either set. Solution 2.14 The five number summary for the day and night classes is Minimum Q1 Median Q3 Maximum Day 32 56 74.5 82.5 99 Night 25.5 78 81 89 98 Table 2.21 a. The IQR for the day group is Q3 – Q1 = 82.5 – 56 = 26.5 The IQR for the night group is Q3 – Q1 = 89 – 78 = 11 The interquartile range (the spread or variability) for the day class is larger than the night class IQR. This suggests more variation will be found in the day class’s class test scores. b. Day class outliers are found using the IQR times 1.5 rule. So, Q1 - IQR(1.5) = 56 – 26.5(1.5) = 16.25 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics 89 Q3 + IQR(1.5) = 82.5 + 26.5(1.5) = 122.25 Since the minimum and maximum values for the day class are greater than 16.25 and less than 122.25, there are no outliers. Night class outliers are calculated as: Q1 – IQR (1.5) = 78 – 11(1.5) = 61.5 Q3 + IQR(1.5) = 89 + 11(1.5) = 105.5 For this class, any test score less than 61.5 is an outlier. Therefore, the scores of 45 and 25.5 are outliers. Since no test score is greater than 105.5, there is no upper end outlier. 2.14 Find the interquartile range for the following two data sets and compare them. Test Scores for Class A 69; 96; 81; 79; 65; 76; 83; 99; 89; 67; 90; 77; 85; 98; 66; 91; 77; 69; 80; 94 Test Scores for Class B 90; 72; 80; 92; 90; 97; 92; 75; 79; 68; 70; 80; 99; 95; 78; 73; 71; 68; 95; 100 Example 2.15 Fifty statistics students were asked how much sleep they get per school night (rounded to the nearest hour). The results were: AMOUNT OF SLEEP PER SCHOOL NIGHT (HOURS) FREQUENCY RELATIVE FREQUENCY CUMULATIVE RELATIVE FREQUENCY 4 2 0.04 0.04 5 5 0.10 0.14 6 7 0.14 0.28 7 12 0.24 0.52 8 14 0.28 0.80 9 7 0.14 0.94 10 3 0.06 1.00 Table 2.22 Find the 28th percentile. Notice the 0.28 in the \"cumulative relative frequency\" column. Twenty-eight percent of 50 data values is 14 values. There are 14 values less than the 28 th percentile. They include the two 4s, the five 5s, and the seven 6s. The 28th percentile is between the last six and the first seven. The 28th percentile is 6.5. Find the median. Look again at the \"cumulative relative frequency\" column and find 0.52. The median is the 50th percentile or the second quartile. 50% of 50 is 25. There are 25 values less than the median. They include the two 4s, the five 5s, the seven 6s, and eleven of the 7s. The median or 50 th percentile is between the 25th, or seven, and 26th, or seven, values. The median is seven. Find the third quartile. The third quartile is the same as the 75th percentile. You can \"eyeball\" this answer. If you look at the \"cumulative relative frequency\" column, you find 0.52 and 0.80. When you have all the fours, fives, 90 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 sixes and sevens, you have 52% of the data. When you include all the 8s, you have 80% of the data. The 75 th percentile, then, must be an eight. Another way to look at the problem is to find 75% of 50, which is 37.5, and round up to 38. The third quartile, Q3, is the 38th value, which is an eight. You can check this answer by counting the values. (There are 37 values below the third quartile and 12 values above.) 2.15 Forty bus drivers were asked how many hours they spend each day running their routes (rounded to the nearest hour). Find the 65th percentile. Amount of time spent on route (hours) Frequency Relative Frequency Cumulative Relative Frequency 2 12 0.30 0.30 3 14 0.35 0.65 4 10 0.25 0.90 5 4 0.10 1.00 Table 2.23 Example 2.16 Using Table 2.22: a. Find the 80th percentile. b. Find the 90th percentile. c. Find the first quartile. What is another name for the first quartile? Solution 2.16 Using the data from the frequency table, we have: a. The 80th percentile is between the last eight and the first nine in the table (between the 40th and 41 st values). Therefore, we need to take the mean of the 40th an 41st values. The 80th percentile =8 + 9 2 = 8.5 b. The 90th percentile will be the 45th data value (location is 0.90(50) = 45) and the 45th data value is nine. c. Q1 is also the 25 th percentile. The 25 th percentile location calculation: P25 = 0.25(50) = 12.5 ≈ 13 the 13th data value. Thus, the 25th percentile is six. 2.16 Refer to the Table 2.23. Find the third quartile. What is another name for the third quartile? Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics 91 Your instructor or a member of the class will ask everyone in class how many sweaters they own. Answer the following questions: 1. How many students were surveyed? 2. What kind of sampling did you do? 3. Construct two different histograms. For each, starting value = _____ ending value = ____. 4. Find the median, first quartile, and third quartile. 5. Construct a table of the data to find the following: a. the 10th percentile b. the 70th percentile c. the percent of students who own less than four sweaters A Formula for Finding the kth Percentile If you were to do a little research, you would find several formulas for calculating the kth percentile. Here is one of them. k = the kth percentile. It may or may not be part of the data. i = the index (ranking or position of a data value) n = the total number of data • Order the data from smallest to largest. • Calculate i= k 100 (n+ 1) • If i is an integer, then the kth percentile is the data value in the ith position in the ordered set of data. • If i is not an integer, then round i up and round i down to the nearest integers. Average the two data values in these two positions in the ordered data set. This is easier to understand in an example. Example 2.17 Listed are 29 ages for Academy Award winning best actors in order from smallest to largest. 18; 21; 22; 25; 26; 27; 29; 30; 31; 33; 36; 37; 41; 42; 47; 52; 55; 57; 58; 62; 64; 67; 69; 71; 72; 73; 74; 76; 77 a. Find the 70th percentile. b. Find the 83rd percentile. Solution 2.17 a. k = 70 i = the index n = 29 i = k 100 (n + 1) = ( 70 100 )(29 + 1) = 21. Twenty-one is an integer, and the data value in the 21 st position in the ordered data set is 64. The 70th percentile is 64 years. b. k = 83rd percentile i = the index 92 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 n = 29 i = k 100 (n + 1) = ) 83 100 )(29 + 1) = 24.9, which is NOT an integer. Round it down to 24 and up to 25. The age in the 24 th position is 71 and the age in the 25 th position is 72. Average 71 and 72. The 83 rd percentile is 71.5 years. 2.17 Listed are 29 ages for Academy Award winning best actors in order from smallest to largest. 18; 21; 22; 25; 26; 27; 29; 30; 31; 33; 36; 37; 41; 42; 47; 52; 55; 57; 58; 62; 64; 67; 69; 71; 72; 73; 74; 76; 77 Calculate the 20th percentile and the 55th percentile. NOTE You can calculate percentiles using calculators and computers. There are a variety of online calculators. A Formula for Finding the Percentile of a Value in a Data Set • Order the data from smallest to largest. • x = the number of data values counting from the bottom of the data list up to but not including the data value for which you want to find the percentile. • y = the number of data values equal to the data value for which you want to find the percentile. • n = the total number of data. • Calculate x+ 0.5y n (100). Then round to the nearest integer. Example 2.18 Listed are 29 ages for Academy Award winning best actors in order from smallest to largest. 18; 21; 22; 25; 26; 27; 29; 30; 31; 33; 36; 37; 41; 42; 47; 52; 55; 57; 58; 62; 64; 67; 69; 71; 72; 73; 74; 76; 77 a. Find the percentile for 58. b. Find the percentile for 25. Solution 2.18 a. Counting from the bottom of the list, there are 18 data values less than 58. There is one value of 58. x = 18 and y = 1. x+ 0.5y n (100) = 18 + 0.5(1) 29 (100) = 63.80. 58 is the 64th percentile. b. Counting from the bottom of the list, there are three data values less than 25. There is one value of 25. x = 3 and y = 1. x+ 0.5y n (100) = 3 + 0.5(1) 29 (100) = 12.07. Twenty-five is the 12th percentile. Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics 93 2.18 Listed are 30 ages for Academy Award winning best actors in order from smallest to largest. 18; 21; 22; 25; 26; 27; 29; 30; 31, 31; 33; 36; 37; 41; 42; 47; 52; 55; 57; 58; 62; 64; 67; 69; 71; 72; 73; 74; 76; 77 Find the percentiles for 47 and 31. Interpreting Percentiles, Quartiles, and Median A percentile indicates the relative standing of a data value when data are sorted into numerical order from smallest to largest. Percentages of data values are less than or equal to the pth percentile. For example, 15% of data values are less than or equal to the 15th percentile. • Low percentiles always correspond to lower data values. • High percentiles always correspond to higher data values. A percentile may or may not correspond to a value judgment about whether it is \"good\" or \"bad.\" The interpretation of whether a certain percentile is \"good\" or \"bad\" depends on the context of the situation to which the data applies. In some situations, a low percentile would be considered \"good;\" in other contexts a high percentile might be considered \"good\". In many situations, there is no value judgment that applies. Understanding how to interpret percentiles properly is important not only when describing data, but also when calculating probabilities in later chapters of this text. NOTE When writing the interpretation of a percentile in the context of the given data, the sentence should contain the following information. • information about the context of the situation being considered • the data value (value of the variable) that represents the percentile • the percent of individuals or items with data values below the percentile • the percent of individuals or items with data values above the percentile. Example 2.19 On a timed math test, the first quartile for time it took to finish the exam was 35 minutes. Interpret the first quartile in the context of this situation. Solution 2.19 • Twenty-five percent of students finished the exam in 35 minutes or less. • Seventy-five percent of students finished the exam in 35 minutes or more. • A low percentile could be considered good, as finishing more quickly on a timed exam is desirable. (If you take too long, you might not be able to finish.) 2.19 For the 100-meter dash, the third quartile for times for finishing the race was 11.5 seconds. Interpret the third quartile in the context of the situation. 94 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Example 2.20 On a 20 question math test, the 70th percentile for number of correct answers was 16. Interpret the 70 th percentile in the context of this situation. Solution 2.20 • Seventy percent of students answered 16 or fewer questions correctly. • Thirty percent of students answered 16 or more questions correctly. • A higher percentile could be considered good, as answering more questions correctly is desirable. 2.20 On a 60 point written assignment, the 80 th percentile for the number of points earned was 49. Interpret the 80 th percentile in the context of this situation. Example 2.21 At a community college, it was found that the 30th percentile of credit units that students are enrolled for is seven units. Interpret the 30th percentile in the context of this situation. Solution 2.21 • Thirty percent of students are enrolled in seven or fewer credit units. • Seventy percent of students are enrolled in seven or more credit units. • In this example, there is no \"good\" or \"bad\" value judgment associated with a higher or lower percentile. Students attend community college for varied reasons and needs, and their course load varies according to their needs. 2.21 During a season, the 40 th percentile for points scored per player in a game is eight. Interpret the 40th percentile in the context of this situation. Example 2.22 Sharpe Middle School is applying for a grant that will be used to add fitness equipment to the gym. The principal surveyed 15 anonymous students to determine how many minutes a day the students spend exercising. The results from the 15 anonymous students are shown. 0 minutes; 40 minutes; 60 minutes; 30 minutes; 60 minutes 10 minutes; 45 minutes; 30 minutes; 300 minutes; 90 minutes; 30 minutes; 120 minutes; 60 minutes; 0 minutes; 20 minutes Determine the following five values. Min = 0 Q1 = 20 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics 95 Med = 40 Q3 = 60 Max = 300 If you were the principal, would you be justified in purchasing new fitness equipment? Since 75% of the students exercise for 60 minutes or less daily, and since the IQR is 40 minutes (60 – 20 = 40), we know that half of the students surveyed exercise between 20 minutes and 60 minutes daily. This seems a reasonable amount of time spent exercising, so the principal would be justified in purchasing the new equipment. However, the principal needs to be careful. The value 300 appears to be a potential outlier. Q3 + 1.5(IQR) = 60 + (1.5)(40) = 120. The value 300 is greater than 120 so it is a potential outlier. If we delete it and calculate the five values, we get the following values: Min = 0 Q1 = 20 Q3 = 60 Max = 120 We still have 75% of the students exercising for 60 minutes or less daily and half of the students exercising between 20 and 60 minutes a day. However, 15 students is a small sample and the principal should survey more students to be sure of his survey results. 2.4 | Box Plots Box plots (also called box-and-whisker plots or box-whisker plots) give a good graphical image of the concentration of the data. They also show how far the extreme values are from most of the data. A box plot is constructed from five values: the minimum value, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum value. We use these values to compare how close other data values are to them. To construct a box plot, use a horizontal or vertical number line and a rectangular box. The smallest and largest data values label the endpoints of the axis. The first quartile marks one end of the box and the third quartile marks the other end of the box. Approximately the middle 50 percent of the data fall inside the box. The \"whiskers\" extend from the ends of the box to the smallest and largest data values. The median or second quartile can be between the first and third quartiles, or it can be one, or the other, or both. The box plot gives a good, quick picture of the data. NOTE You may encounter box-and-whisker plots that have dots marking outlier values. In those cases, the whiskers are not extending to the minimum and maximum values. Consider, again, this dataset. 1; 1; 2; 2; 4; 6; 6.8; 7.2; 8; 8.3; 9; 10; 10; 11.5 The first quartile is two, the median is seven, and the third quartile is nine. The smallest value is one, and the largest value is 11.5. The following image shows the constructed box plot.

The median is shown with a dashed line. NOTE It is important to start a box plot with a scaled number line. Otherwise the box plot may not be useful. Example 2.23 The following data are the heights of 40 students in a statistics class. 59; 60; 61; 62; 62; 63; 63; 64; 64; 64; 65; 65; 65; 65; 65; 65; 65; 65; 65; 66; 66; 67; 67; 68; 68; 69; 70; 70; 70; 70; 70; 71; 71; 72; 72; 73; 74; 74; 75; 77 Construct a box plot with the following properties; the calculator intructions for the minimum and maximum values as well as the quartiles follow the example. • Minimum value = 59 • Maximum value = 77 • Q1: First quartile = 64.5 • Q2: Second quartile or median= 66 • Q3: Third quartile = 70 Figure 2.12 a. Each quarter has approximately 25% of the data. b. The spreads of the four quarters are 64.5 – 59 = 5.5 (first quarter), 66 – 64.5 = 1.5 (second quarter), 70 – 66 = 4 (third quarter), and 77 – 70 = 7 (fourth quarter). So, the second quarter has the smallest spread and the fourth quarter has the largest spread. c. Range = maximum value – the minimum value = 77 – 59 = 18 d. Interquartile Range: IQR = Q3 – Q1 = 70 – 64.5 = 5.5. e. The interval 59–65 has more than 25% of the data so it has more data in it than the interval 66 through 70 which has 25% of the data. f. The middle 50% (middle half) of the data has a range of 5.5 inches.

For instance, you might have a data set in which the median and the third quartile are the same. In this case, the diagram would not have a dotted line inside the box displaying the median. The right side of the box would display both the third quartile and the median. For example, if the smallest value and the first quartile were both one, the median and the third quartile were both five, and the largest value was seven, the box plot would look like: Figure 2.13 In this case, at least 25% of the values are equal to one. Twenty-five percent of the values are between one and five, 98 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 inclusive.

The two most widely used measures of the \"center\" of the data are the mean (average) and the median. To calculate the mean weight of 50 people, add the 50 weights together and divide by 50. To find the median weight of the 50 people, order the data and find the number that splits the data into two equal parts. The median is generally a better measure of the center when there are extreme values or outliers because it is not affected by the precise numerical values of the outliers. The mean is the most common measure of the center. NOTE The words “mean” and “average” are often used interchangeably. The substitution of one word for the other is common 100 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 practice. The technical term is “arithmetic mean” and “average” is technically a center location. However, in practice among non-statisticians, “average\" is commonly accepted for “arithmetic mean.” When each value in the data set is not unique, the mean can be calculated by multiplying each distinct value by its frequency and then dividing the sum by the total number of data values. The letter used to represent the sample mean is an x with a bar over it (pronounced “x bar”): x ¯ . The Greek letter μ (pronounced \"mew\") represents the population mean. One of the requirements for the sample mean to be a good estimate of the population mean is for the sample taken to be truly random. To see that both ways of calculating the mean are the same, consider the sample: 1; 1; 1; 2; 2; 3; 4; 4; 4; 4; 4 x ¯ =1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 11 = 2.7 x¯ =3(1) + 2(2) + 1(3) + 5(4) 11 = 2.7 In the second calculation, the frequencies are 3, 2, 1, and 5. You can quickly find the location of the median by using the expression n+ 1 2 . The letter n is the total number of data values in the sample. If n is an odd number, the median is the middle value of the ordered data (ordered smallest to largest). If n is an even number, the median is equal to the two middle values added together and divided by two after the data has been ordered. For example, if the total number of data values is 97, then n+ 1 2 = 97 + 1 2 = 49. The median is the 49 th value in the ordered data. If the total number of data values is 100, then n+ 1 2 = 100 + 1 2 = 50.5. The median occurs midway between the 50th and 51st values. The location of the median and the value of the median are not the same. The upper case letter M is often used to represent the median. The next example illustrates the location of the median and the value of the median. Example 2.26 AIDS data indicating the number of months a patient with AIDS lives after taking a new antibody drug are as follows (smallest to largest): 3; 4; 8; 8; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 15; 16; 16; 17; 17; 18; 21; 22; 22; 24; 24; 25; 26; 26; 27; 27; 29; 29; 31; 32; 33; 33; 34; 34; 35; 37; 40; 44; 44; 47; Calculate the mean and the median. Solution 2.26 The calculation for the mean is: x ¯ =[3 + 4 +(8)(2)+ 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 +(15)(2)+ (16)(2)+ ... + 35 + 37 + 40 +(44)(2)+ 47] 40 = 23.6 To find the median, M, first use the formula for the location. The location is: n+ 1 2 =40 + 1 2 = 20.5 Starting at the smallest value, the median is located between the 20th and 21st values (the two 24s): 3; 4; 8; 8; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 15; 16; 16; 17; 17; 18; 21; 22; 22; 24; 24; 25; 26; 26; 27; 27; 29; 29; 31; 32; 33; 33; 34; 34; 35; 37; 40; 44; 44; 47; M =24 + 24 2 = 24 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics 101 To find the mean and the median: Clear list L1.

The data are ordered from smallest to largest. Calculate the mean and median. 3; 4; 5; 7; 7; 7; 7; 8; 8; 9; 9; 10; 10; 10; 10; 10; 11; 12; 12; 13; 14; 14; 15; 15; 17; 17; 18; 19; 19; 19; 21; 21; 22; 22; 23; 24; 24; 24; 24 Example 2.27 Suppose that in a small town of 50 people, one person earns $5,000,000 per year and the other 49 each earn $30,000. Which is the better measure of the \"center\": the mean or the median? Solution 2.27 x¯ =5, 000, 000 + 49(30, 000) 50 = 129,400 M = 30,000 (There are 49 people who earn $30,000 and one person who earns $5,000,000.) The median is a better measure of the \"center\" than the mean because 49 of the values are 30,000 and one is 5,000,000. The 5,000,000 is an outlier. The 30,000 gives us a better sense of the middle of the data. 2.27 In a sample of 60 households, one house is worth $2,500,000. Half of the rest are worth $280,000, and all the others are worth $315,000. Which is the better measure of the “center”: the mean or the median? Another measure of the center is the mode. The mode is the most frequent value. There can be more than one mode in a data set as long as those values have the same frequency and that frequency is the highest. A data set with two modes is called bimodal. 102 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Example 2.28 Statistics exam scores for 20 students are as follows: 50; 53; 59; 59; 63; 63; 72; 72; 72; 72; 72; 76; 78; 81; 83; 84; 84; 84; 90; 93 Find the mode. Solution 2.28 The most frequent score is 72, which occurs five times. Mode = 72. 2.28 The number of books checked out from the library from 25 students are as follows: 0; 0; 0; 1; 2; 3; 3; 4; 4; 5; 5; 7; 7; 7; 7; 8; 8; 8; 9; 10; 10; 11; 11; 12; 12 Find the mode. Example 2.29 Five real estate exam scores are 430, 430, 480, 480, 495. The data set is bimodal because the scores 430 and 480 each occur twice. When is the mode the best measure of the \"center\"? Consider a weight loss program that advertises a mean weight loss of six pounds the first week of the program. The mode might indicate that most people lose two pounds the first week, making the program less appealing. NOTE The mode can be calculated for qualitative data as well as for quantitative data. For example, if the data set is: red, red, red, green, green, yellow, purple, black, blue, the mode is red. Statistical software will easily calculate the mean, the median, and the mode. Some graphing calculators can also make these calculations. In the real world, people make these calculations using software. 2.29 Five credit scores are 680, 680, 700, 720, 720. The data set is bimodal because the scores 680 and 720 each occur twice. Consider the annual earnings of workers at a factory. The mode is $25,000 and occurs 150 times out of 301. The median is $50,000 and the mean is $47,500. What would be the best measure of the “center”? The Law of Large Numbers and the Mean The Law of Large Numbers says that if you take samples of larger and larger size from any population, then the mean x ¯ of the sample is very likely to get closer and closer to µ. This is discussed in more detail later in the text. Sampling Distributions and Statistic of a Sampling Distribution You can think of a sampling distribution as a relative frequency distribution with a great many samples. (See Sampling and Data for a review of relative frequency). Suppose thirty randomly selected students were asked the number of movies they watched the previous week. The results are in the relative frequency table shown below. Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics 103 # of movies Relative Frequency 0 5 30 1 15 30 2 6 30 3 3 30 4 1 30 Table 2.24 If you let the number of samples get very large (say, 300 million or more), the relative frequency table becomes a relative frequency distribution. A statistic is a number calculated from a sample. Statistic examples include the mean, the median and the mode as well as others. The sample mean x ¯ is an example of a statistic which estimates the population mean μ. Calculating the Mean of Grouped Frequency Tables When only grouped data is available, you do not know the individual data values (we only know intervals and interval frequencies); therefore, you cannot compute an exact mean for the data set. What we must do is estimate the actual mean by calculating the mean of a frequency table. A frequency table is a data representation in which grouped data is displayed along with the corresponding frequencies. To calculate the mean from a grouped frequency table we can apply the basic definition of mean: mean = data sum number o f data values We simply need to modify the definition to fit within the restrictions of a frequency table. Since we do not know the individual data values we can instead find the midpoint of each interval. The midpoint is lower boundary+ upper boundary 2 . We can now modify the mean definition to be Mean o f Frequency Table =∑ f m ∑ f where f = the frequency of the interval and m = the midpoint of the interval. 104 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Example 2.30 A frequency table displaying professor Blount’s last statistic test is shown.

As part of her study, she compiled the following data: Hours Teenagers Spend on Video Games Number of Teenagers 0–3.5 3 3.5–7.5 7 7.5–11.5 12 11.5–15.5 7 15.5–19.5 9 Table 2.27 What is the best estimate for the mean number of hours spent playing video games? 2.6 | Skewness and the Mean, Median, and Mode Consider the following data set. 4; 5; 6; 6; 6; 7; 7; 7; 7; 7; 7; 8; 8; 8; 9; 10 This data set can be represented by following histogram. Each interval has width one, and each value is located in the middle of an interval. Figure 2.16 The histogram displays a symmetrical distribution of data. A distribution is symmetrical if a vertical line can be drawn at some point in the histogram such that the shape to the left and the right of the vertical line are mirror images of each other. The mean, the median, and the mode are each seven for these data. In a perfectly symmetrical distribution, the mean and the median are the same. This example has one mode (unimodal), and the mode is the same as the mean and median. In a symmetrical distribution that has two modes (bimodal), the two modes would be different from the mean and median. The histogram for the data: 4; 5; 6; 6; 6; 7; 7; 7; 7; 8 is not symmetrical. The right-hand side seems \"chopped off\" compared to the left side. A distribution of this type is called skewed to the left because it is pulled out to the left. 106 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Figure 2.17 The mean is 6.3, the median is 6.5, and the mode is seven. Notice that the mean is less than the median, and they are both less than the mode. The mean and the median both reflect the skewing, but the mean reflects it more so. The histogram for the data: 6; 7; 7; 7; 7; 8; 8; 8; 9; 10, is also not symmetrical. It is skewed to the right. Figure 2.18 The mean is 7.7, the median is 7.5, and the mode is seven. Of the three statistics, the mean is the largest, while the mode is the smallest. Again, the mean reflects the skewing the most. To summarize, generally if the distribution of data is skewed to the left, the mean is less than the median, which is often less than the mode. If the distribution of data is skewed to the right, the mode is often less than the median, which is less than the mean. Skewness and symmetry become important when we discuss probability distributions in later chapters. Example 2.31 Statistics are used to compare and sometimes identify authors. The following lists shows a simple random sample that compares the letter counts for three authors.

Figure 2.20 Davis’ distribution has a left (negative) skew Figure 2.21 Maris’ distribution is symmetrically shaped. b. Terry’s mean is 3.7, Davis’ mean is 2.7, Maris’ mean is 4.6. c. Terry’s median is three, Davis’ median is three. Maris’ median is four. d. It appears that the median is always closest to the high point (the mode), while the mean tends to be farther out on the tail. In a symmetrical distribution, the mean and the median are both centrally located close to the high point of the distribution. 108 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 2.31 Discuss the mean, median, and mode for each of the following problems.

In some data sets, the data values are concentrated closely near the mean; in other data sets, the data values are more widely spread out from the mean. The most common measure of variation, or spread, is the standard deviation. The standard deviation is a number that measures how far data values are from their mean. The standard deviation • provides a numerical measure of the overall amount of variation in a data set, and • can be used to determine whether a particular data value is close to or far from the mean. The standard deviation provides a measure of the overall variation in a data set The standard deviation is always positive or zero. The standard deviation is small when the data are all concentrated close to the mean, exhibiting little variation or spread. The standard deviation is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more variation. Suppose that we are studying the amount of time customers wait in line at the checkout at supermarket A and supermarket B. the average wait time at both supermarkets is five minutes. At supermarket A, the standard deviation for the wait time is two minutes; at supermarket B the standard deviation for the wait time is four minutes. Because supermarket B has a higher standard deviation, we know that there is more variation in the wait times at supermarket B. Overall, wait times at supermarket B are more spread out from the average; wait times at supermarket A are more concentrated near the average. The standard deviation can be used to determine whether a data value is close to or far from the mean. Suppose that Rosa and Binh both shop at supermarket A. Rosa waits at the checkout counter for seven minutes and Binh waits for one minute. At supermarket A, the mean waiting time is five minutes and the standard deviation is two minutes. The standard deviation can be used to determine whether a data value is close to or far from the mean. Rosa waits for seven minutes: • Seven is two minutes longer than the average of five; two minutes is equal to one standard deviation. • Rosa's wait time of seven minutes is two minutes longer than the average of five minutes. • Rosa's wait time of seven minutes is one standard deviation above the average of five minutes. Binh waits for one minute. • One is four minutes less than the average of five; four minutes is equal to two standard deviations. • Binh's wait time of one minute is four minutes less than the average of five minutes. • Binh's wait time of one minute is two standard deviations below the average of five minutes. • A data value that is two standard deviations from the average is just on the borderline for what many statisticians would consider to be far from the average. Considering data to be far from the mean if it is more than two standard deviations away is more of an approximate \"rule of thumb\" than a rigid rule. In general, the shape of the distribution of the data affects how much of the data is further away than two standard deviations. (You will learn more about this in later chapters.) The number line may help you understand standard deviation. If we were to put five and seven on a number line, seven is to the right of five. We say, then, that seven is one standard deviation to the right of five because 5 + (1)(2) = 7. If one were also part of the data set, then one is two standard deviations to the left of five because 5 + (–2)(2) = 1. Figure 2.24 • In general, a value = mean + (#ofSTDEV)(standard deviation) • where #ofSTDEVs = the number of standard deviations • #ofSTDEV does not need to be an integer 110 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 • One is two standard deviations less than the mean of five because: 1 = 5 + (–2)(2). The equation value = mean + (#ofSTDEVs)(standard deviation) can be expressed for a sample and for a population. • sample: x = x¯ + ( #o f STDEV)(s) • Population: x=µ + ( #o f STDEV)(σ) The lower case letter s represents the sample standard deviation and the Greek letter σ (sigma, lower case) represents the population standard deviation. The symbol x ¯ is the sample mean and the Greek symbol µ is the population mean. Calculating the Standard Deviation If x is a number, then the difference \"x – mean\" is called its deviation. In a data set, there are as many deviations as there are items in the data set. The deviations are used to calculate the standard deviation. If the numbers belong to a population, in symbols a deviation is x – μ. For sample data, in symbols a deviation is x – x¯ . The procedure to calculate the standard deviation depends on whether the numbers are the entire population or are data from a sample. The calculations are similar, but not identical. Therefore the symbol used to represent the standard deviation depends on whether it is calculated from a population or a sample. The lower case letter s represents the sample standard deviation and the Greek letter σ (sigma, lower case) represents the population standard deviation. If the sample has the same characteristics as the population, then s should be a good estimate of σ. To calculate the standard deviation, we need to calculate the variance first. The variance is the average of the squares of the deviations (the x – x¯ values for a sample, or the x – μ values for a population). The symbol σ2 represents the population variance; the population standard deviation σ is the square root of the population variance. The symbol s2 represents the sample variance; the sample standard deviation s is the square root of the sample variance. You can think of the standard deviation as a special average of the deviations. If the numbers come from a census of the entire population and not a sample, when we calculate the average of the squared deviations to find the variance, we divide by N, the number of items in the population. If the data are from a sample rather than a population, when we calculate the average of the squared deviations, we divide by n – 1, one less than the number of items in the sample. Formulas for the Sample Standard Deviation • s= Σ(x− x¯ ) 2 n− 1 or s= Σ f (x− x¯ ) 2 n− 1 • For the sample standard deviation, the denominator is n - 1, that is the sample size MINUS 1. Formulas for the Population Standard Deviation • σ = Σ(x−µ) 2 N or σ = Σ f (x–µ) 2 N • For the population standard deviation, the denominator is N, the number of items in the population. In these formulas, f represents the frequency with which a value appears. For example, if a value appears once, f is one. If a value appears three times in the data set or population, f is three. Sampling Variability of a Statistic The statistic of a sampling distribution was discussed in Descriptive Statistics: Measuring the Center of the Data. How much the statistic varies from one sample to another is known as the sampling variability of a statistic. You typically measure the sampling variability of a statistic by its standard error. The standard error of the mean is an example of a standard error. It is a special standard deviation and is known as the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean. You will cover the standard error of the mean in the chapter The Central Limit Theorem (not now). The notation for the standard error of the mean is σ nwhere σ is the standard deviation of the population and n is the size of the sample. Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics 111 NOTE In practice, USE A CALCULATOR OR COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO CALCULATE THE STANDARD DEVIATION. If you are using a TI-83, 83+, 84+ calculator, you need to select the appropriate standard deviation σx or sx from the summary statistics. We will concentrate on using and interpreting the information that the standard deviation gives us. However you should study the following step-by-step example to help you understand how the standard deviation measures variation from the mean. (The calculator instructions appear at the end of this example.) Example 2.32 In a fifth grade class, the teacher was interested in the average age and the sample standard deviation of the ages of her students. The following data are the ages for a SAMPLE of n = 20 fifth grade students. The ages are rounded to the nearest half year: 9; 9.5; 9.5; 10; 10; 10; 10; 10.5; 10.5; 10.5; 10.5; 11; 11; 11; 11; 11; 11; 11.5; 11.5; 11.5; x¯ =9 + 9.5(2) + 10(4) + 10.5(4) + 11(6) + 11.5(3) 20 = 10.525 The average age is 10.53 years, rounded to two places. The variance may be calculated by using a table. Then the standard deviation is calculated by taking the square root of the variance. We will explain the parts of the table after calculating s.

Typically, you do the calculation for the standard deviation on your calculator or computer. The intermediate results are not rounded. This is done for accuracy. • For the following problems, recall that value = mean + (#ofSTDEVs)(standard deviation).

Then find the value that is two standard deviations above the mean. Explanation of the standard deviation calculation shown in the table The deviations show how spread out the data are about the mean. The data value 11.5 is farther from the mean than is the data value 11 which is indicated by the deviations 0.97 and 0.47. A positive deviation occurs when the data value is greater than the mean, whereas a negative deviation occurs when the data value is less than the mean. The deviation is –1.525 for the data value nine. If you add the deviations, the sum is always zero. (For Example 2.32, there are n = 20 deviations.) So you cannot simply add the deviations to get the spread of the data. By squaring the deviations, you make them positive numbers, and the sum will also be positive. The variance, then, is the average squared deviation. The variance is a squared measure and does not have the same units as the data. Taking the square root solves the problem. The standard deviation measures the spread in the same units as the data. Notice that instead of dividing by n = 20, the calculation divided by n – 1 = 20 – 1 = 19 because the data is a sample. Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics 113 For the sample variance, we divide by the sample size minus one (n – 1). Why not divide by n? The answer has to do with the population variance. The sample variance is an estimate of the population variance. Based on the theoretical mathematics that lies behind these calculations, dividing by (n – 1) gives a better estimate of the population variance. NOTE Your concentration should be on what the standard deviation tells us about the data. The standard deviation is a number which measures how far the data are spread from the mean. Let a calculator or computer do the arithmetic. The standard deviation, s or σ, is either zero or larger than zero. Describing the data with reference to the spread is called \"variability\". The variability in data depends upon the method by which the outcomes are obtained; for example, by measuring or by random sampling. When the standard deviation is zero, there is no spread; that is, the all the data values are equal to each other. The standard deviation is small when the data are all concentrated close to the mean, and is larger when the data values show more variation from the mean. When the standard deviation is a lot larger than zero, the data values are very spread out about the mean; outliers can make s or σ very large. The standard deviation, when first presented, can seem unclear. By graphing your data, you can get a better \"feel\" for the deviations and the standard deviation. You will find that in symmetrical distributions, the standard deviation can be very helpful but in skewed distributions, the standard deviation may not be much help. The reason is that the two sides of a skewed distribution have different spreads. In a skewed distribution, it is better to look at the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, the smallest value, and the largest value. Because numbers can be confusing, always graph your data. Display your data in a histogram or a box plot. Example 2.33 Use the following data (first exam scores) from Susan Dean's spring pre-calculus class: 33; 42; 49; 49; 53; 55; 55; 61; 63; 67; 68; 68; 69; 69; 72; 73; 74; 78; 80; 83; 88; 88; 88; 90; 92; 94; 94; 94; 94; 96; 100 a. Create a chart containing the data, frequencies, relative frequencies, and cumulative relative frequencies to three decimal places. b. Calculate the following to one decimal place using a TI-83+ or TI-84 calculator: i. The sample mean ii. The sample standard deviation iii. The median iv. The first quartile v. The third quartile vi. IQR c. Construct a box plot and a histogram on the same set of axes. Make comments about the box plot, the histogram, and the chart. Solution 2.33 a. See Table 2.30 b. i. The sample mean = 73.5 ii. The sample standard deviation = 17.9 iii. The median = 73 iv. The first quartile = 61 v. The third quartile = 90 vi. IQR = 90 – 61 = 29 114 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 c. The x-axis goes from 32.5 to 100.5; y-axis goes from –2.4 to 15 for the histogram. The number of intervals is five, so the width of an interval is (100.5 – 32.5) divided by five, is equal to 13.6. Endpoints of the intervals are as follows: the starting point is 32.5, 32.5 + 13.6 = 46.1, 46.1 + 13.6 = 59.7, 59.7 + 13.6 = 73.3, 73.3 + 13.6 = 86.9, 86.9 + 13.6 = 100.5 = the ending value; No data values fall on an interval boundary. Figure 2.25 The long left whisker in the box plot is reflected in the left side of the histogram. The spread of the exam scores in the lower 50% is greater (73 – 33 = 40) than the spread in the upper 50% (100 – 73 = 27). The histogram, box plot, and chart all reflect this. There are a substantial number of A and B grades (80s, 90s, and 100). The histogram clearly shows this. The box plot shows us that the middle 50% of the exam scores (IQR = 29) are Ds, Cs, and Bs. The box plot also shows us that the lower 25% of the exam scores are Ds and Fs.

Standard deviation of Grouped Frequency Tables Recall that for grouped data we do not know individual data values, so we cannot describe the typical value of the data with precision. In other words, we cannot find the exact mean, median, or mode. We can, however, determine the best estimate of the measures of center by finding the mean of the grouped data with the formula: Mean o f Frequency Table =∑ f m ∑ f where f = interval frequencies and m = interval midpoints. Just as we could not find the exact mean, neither can we find the exact standard deviation. Remember that standard deviation describes numerically the expected deviation a data value has from the mean. In simple English, the standard deviation allows us to compare how “unusual” individual data is compared to the mean. Example 2.34 Find the standard deviation for the data in Table 2.31. Class Frequency, f Midpoint, m m2 x¯ 2 fm2 Standard Deviation 0–2 1 1 1 7.58 1 3.5 3–5 6 4 16 7.58 96 3.5 6–8 10 7 49 7.58 490 3.5 9–11 7 10 100 7.58 700 3.5 12–14 0 13 169 7.58 0 3.5 15–17 2 16 256 7.58 512 3.5 Table 2.31 116 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 For this data set, we have the mean, x¯ = 7.58 and the standard deviation, sx = 3.5. This means that a randomly selected data value would be expected to be 3.5 units from the mean. If we look at the first class, we see that the class midpoint is equal to one. This is almost two full standard deviations from the mean since 7.58 – 3.5 – 3.5 = 0.58. While the formula for calculating the standard deviation is not complicated, sx= f (m − x¯ ) 2 n− 1 where sx = sample standard deviation, x¯ = sample mean, the calculations are tedious. It is usually best to use technology when performing the calculations. 2.34 Find the standard deviation for the data from the previous example Class Frequency, f 0–2 1 3–5 6 6–8 10 9–11 7 12–14 0 15–17 2 Table 2.32 First, press the STAT key and select 1:Edit Figure 2.26 Input the midpoint values into L1 and the frequencies into L2 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics 117 Figure 2.27 Select STAT, CALC, and 1: 1-Var Stats Figure 2.28 Select 2nd then 1 then , 2nd then 2 Enter Figure 2.29 You will see displayed both a population standard deviation, σx, and the sample standard deviation, sx. Comparing Values from Different Data Sets The standard deviation is useful when comparing data values that come from different data sets. If the data sets have different means and standard deviations, then comparing the data values directly can be misleading. • For each data value, calculate how many standard deviations away from its mean the value is. • Use the formula: value = mean + (#ofSTDEVs)(standard deviation); solve for #ofSTDEVs. 118 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 • #o f STDEVs= value – mean standard deviation • Compare the results of this calculation. #ofSTDEVs is often called a \"z-score\"; we can use the symbol z. In symbols, the formulas become: Sample x= x ¯ + zs z =x − x¯ s Population x= µ + zσ z =x − µ σ Table 2.33 Example 2.35 Two students, John and Ali, from different high schools, wanted to find out who had the highest GPA when compared to his school. Which student had the highest GPA when compared to his school? Student GPA School Mean GPA School Standard Deviation John 2.85 3.0 0.7 Ali 77 80 10 Table 2.34 Solution 2.35 For each student, determine how many standard deviations (#ofSTDEVs) his GPA is away from the average, for his school. Pay careful attention to signs when comparing and interpreting the answer. z = # of STDEVs =value – mean standard deviation =x–µ σ For John, z = #o f STDEVs=2.85 – 3.0 0.7 = – 0.21 For Ali, z = #o f STDEVs=77 − 80 10 = − 0.3 John has the better GPA when compared to his school because his GPA is 0.21 standard deviations below his school's mean while Ali's GPA is 0.3 standard deviations below his school's mean. John's z-score of –0.21 is higher than Ali's z-score of –0.3. For GPA, higher values are better, so we conclude that John has the better GPA when compared to his school. 2.35 Two swimmers, Angie and Beth, from different teams, wanted to find out who had the fastest time for the 50 meter freestyle when compared to her team. Which swimmer had the fastest time when compared to her team?

For ANY data set, no matter what the distribution of the data is: • At least 75% of the data is within two standard deviations of the mean. • At least 89% of the data is within three standard deviations of the mean. • At least 95% of the data is within 4.5 standard deviations of the mean. • This is known as Chebyshev's Rule. For data having a distribution that is BELL-SHAPED and SYMMETRIC: • Approximately 68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean. • Approximately 95% of the data is within two standard deviations of the mean. • More than 99% of the data is within three standard deviations of the mean. • This is known as the Empirical Rule. • It is important to note that this rule only applies when the shape of the distribution of the data is bell-shaped and symmetric. We will learn more about this when studying the \"Normal\" or \"Gaussian\" probability distribution in later chapters. 2.8 | Descriptive Statistics 120 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 2.1 Descriptive Statistics Class Time: Names: Student Learning Outcomes • The student will construct a histogram and a box plot. • The student will calculate univariate statistics. • The student will examine the graphs to interpret what the data implies.

The term 'mean' is a shortened form of 'arithmetic mean.'

The second quartile is the median of the data. the ratio of the number of times a value of the data occurs in the set of all outcomes to the number of all outcomes used to describe data that is not symmetrical; when the right side of a graph looks “chopped off” compared the left side, we say it is “skewed to the left.” When the left side of the graph looks “chopped off” compared to the right side, we say the data is “skewed to the right.” Alternatively: when the lower values of the data are more spread out, we say the data are skewed to the left. When the greater values are more spread out, the data are skewed to the right. a number that is equal to the square root of the variance and measures how far data values are from their mean; notation: s for sample standard deviation and σ for population standard deviation. mean of the squared deviations from the mean, or the square of the standard deviation; for a set of data, a Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics 123 deviation can be represented as x – x¯ where x is a value of the data and x¯ is the sample mean. The sample variance is equal to the sum of the squares of the deviations divided by the difference of the sample size and one. CHAPTER REVIEW 2.1 Stem-and-Leaf Graphs (Stemplots), Line Graphs, and Bar Graphs A stem-and-leaf plot is a way to plot data and look at the distribution. In a stem-and-leaf plot, all data values within a class are visible. The advantage in a stem-and-leaf plot is that all values are listed, unlike a histogram, which gives classes of data values. A line graph is often used to represent a set of data values in which a quantity varies with time. These graphs are useful for finding trends. That is, finding a general pattern in data sets including temperature, sales, employment, company profit or cost over a period of time. A bar graph is a chart that uses either horizontal or vertical bars to show comparisons among categories. One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a discrete value. Some bar graphs present bars clustered in groups of more than one (grouped bar graphs), and others show the bars divided into subparts to show cumulative effect (stacked bar graphs). Bar graphs are especially useful when categorical data is being used. 2.2 Histograms, Frequency Polygons, and Time Series Graphs A histogram is a graphic version of a frequency distribution. The graph consists of bars of equal width drawn adjacent to each other. The horizontal scale represents classes of quantitative data values and the vertical scale represents frequencies. The heights of the bars correspond to frequency values. Histograms are typically used for large, continuous, quantitative data sets. A frequency polygon can also be used when graphing large data sets with data points that repeat. The data usually goes on y-axis with the frequency being graphed on the x-axis. Time series graphs can be helpful when looking at large amounts of data for one variable over a period of time. 2.3 Measures of the Location of the Data The values that divide a rank-ordered set of data into 100 equal parts are called percentiles. Percentiles are used to compare and interpret data. For example, an observation at the 50 th percentile would be greater than 50 percent of the other obeservations in the set. Quartiles divide data into quarters. The first quartile (Q1) is the 25th percentile,the second quartile (Q2 or median) is 50 th percentile, and the third quartile (Q3) is the the 75th percentile. The interquartile range, or IQR, is the range of the middle 50 percent of the data values. The IQR is found by subtracting Q1 from Q3, and can help determine outliers by using the following two expressions. • Q3 + IQR(1.5) • Q1 – IQR(1.5) 2.4 Box Plots Box plots are a type of graph that can help visually organize data. To graph a box plot the following data points must be calculated: the minimum value, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum value. Once the box plot is graphed, you can display and compare distributions of data. 2.5 Measures of the Center of the Data The mean and the median can be calculated to help you find the \"center\" of a data set. The mean is the best estimate for the actual data set, but the median is the best measurement when a data set contains several outliers or extreme values. The mode will tell you the most frequently occuring datum (or data) in your data set. The mean, median, and mode are extremely helpful when you need to analyze your data, but if your data set consists of ranges which lack specific values, the mean may seem impossible to calculate. However, the mean can be approximated if you add the lower boundary with the upper boundary and divide by two to find the midpoint of each interval. Multiply each midpoint by the number of values found in the corresponding range. Divide the sum of these values by the total number of data values in the set. 2.6 Skewness and the Mean, Median, and Mode Looking at the distribution of data can reveal a lot about the relationship between the mean, the median, and the mode. There are three types of distributions. A right (or positive) skewed distribution has a shape like Figure 2.17. A left (or negative) skewed distribution has a shape like Figure 2.18. A symmetrical distrubtion looks like Figure 2.16. 124 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 2.7 Measures of the Spread of the Data The standard deviation can help you calculate the spread of data. There are different equations to use if are calculating the standard deviation of a sample or of a population. • The Standard Deviation allows us to compare individual data or classes to the data set mean numerically. • s = ∑ (x− x¯ ) 2 n− 1 or s = ∑ f (x− x¯ ) 2 n− 1 is the formula for calculating the standard deviation of a sample. To calculate the standard deviation of a population, we would use the population mean, μ, and the formula σ = ∑ (x−µ) 2 N or σ = ∑ f (x−µ) 2 N .

The 40th percentile is 37 years. b. The 78th percentile is 70 years. 25 Jesse graduated 37 th out of a class of 180 students. There are 180 – 37 = 143 students ranked below Jesse. There is one rank of 37. x = 143 and y = 1. x+ 0.5y n (100) = 143 + 0.5(1) 180 (100) = 79.72. Jesse’s rank of 37 puts him at the 80th percentile. 27 a. For runners in a race it is more desirable to have a high percentile for speed. A high percentile means a higher speed which is faster. b. 40% of runners ran at speeds of 7.5 miles per hour or less (slower). 60% of runners ran at speeds of 7.5 miles per hour or more (faster). 29 When waiting in line at the DMV, the 85 th percentile would be a long wait time compared to the other people waiting. 85% of people had shorter wait times than Mina. In this context, Mina would prefer a wait time corresponding to a lower percentile. 85% of people at the DMV waited 32 minutes or less. 15% of people at the DMV waited 32 minutes or longer. 31 The manufacturer and the consumer would be upset. This is a large repair cost for the damages, compared to the other Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics 165 cars in the sample. INTERPRETATION: 90% of the crash tested cars had damage repair costs of $1700 or less; only 10% had damage repair costs of $1700 or more. 33 You can afford 34% of houses. 66% of the houses are too expensive for your budget.

Mode = 25, 27 47 4 49 The data are symmetrical. The median is 3 and the mean is 2.85. They are close, and the mode lies close to the middle of the data, so the data are symmetrical. 51 The data are skewed right. The median is 87.5 and the mean is 88.2. Even though they are close, the mode lies to the left of the middle of the data, and there are many more instances of 87 than any other number, so the data are skewed right. 53 When the data are symmetrical, the mean and median are close or the same. 55 The distribution is skewed right because it looks pulled out to the right. 57 The mean is 4.1 and is slightly greater than the median, which is four. 59 The mode and the median are the same. In this case, they are both five. 61 The distribution is skewed left because it looks pulled out to the left. 63 The mean and the median are both six. 65 The mode is 12, the median is 12.5, and the mean is 15.1. The mean is the largest. 67 The mean tends to reflect skewing the most because it is affected the most by outliers. 69 s = 34.5 71 For Fredo: z = 0.158 – 0.166 0.012 = –0.67 For Karl: z = 0.177 – 0.189 0.015 = –0.8 Fredo’s z-score of –0.67 is higher than Karl’s z-score of –0.8.

The right whisker shows that 25% of the population are adults 50 and older, so adults 65 and over represent less than 25%. b. 62.4% 87 a. Answers will vary. Possible answer: State University conducted a survey to see how involved its students are in community service. The box plot shows the number of community service hours logged by participants over the past year. b. Because the first and second quartiles are close, the data in this quarter is very similar. There is not much variation in the values. The data in the third quarter is much more variable, or spread out. This is clear because the second quartile is so far away from the third quartile. 89 a. Each box plot is spread out more in the greater values. Each plot is skewed to the right, so the ages of the top 50% of buyers are more variable than the ages of the lower 50%. b. The BMW 3 series is most likely to have an outlier. It has the longest whisker. c. Comparing the median ages, younger people tend to buy the BMW 3 series, while older people tend to buy the BMW 7 series. However, this is not a rule, because there is so much variability in each data set. d. The second quarter has the smallest spread. There seems to be only a three-year difference between the first quartile and the median. e. The third quarter has the largest spread. There seems to be approximately a 14-year difference between the median and the third quartile. 170 Chapter 2 | Descriptive Statistics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 f. IQR ~ 17 years g. There is not enough information to tell. Each interval lies within a quarter, so we cannot tell exactly where the data in that quarter is concentrated. h. The interval from 31 to 35 years has the fewest data values. Twenty-five percent of the values fall in the interval 38 to 41, and 25% fall between 41 and 64. Since 25% of values fall between 31 and 38, we know that fewer than 25% fall between 31 and 35. 92 The mean percentage, x¯ =1328.65 50 = 26.75 94 The median value is the middle value in the ordered list of data values.

For guitars, the cost of the guitar is 0.25 standard deviations ABOVE the mean. For drums, the cost of the drum set is 1.0 standard deviations BELOW the mean. Of the three, the drums cost the lowest in comparison to the cost of other instruments of the same type. The guitar costs the most in comparison to the cost of other instruments of the same type. 106 • x¯ = 23.32 • Using the TI 83/84, we obtain a standard deviation of: sx= 12.95. • The obesity rate of the United States is 10.58% higher than the average obesity rate. • Since the standard deviation is 12.95, we see that 23.32 + 12.95 = 36.27 is the obesity percentage that is one standard deviation from the mean. The United States obesity rate is slightly less than one standard deviation from the mean. Therefore, we can assume that the United States, while 34% obese, does not hav e an unusually high percentage of obese people. 108 a.

(credit: Navicore/flickr) Introduction Chapter Objectives By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: • Understand and use the terminology of probability. • Determine whether two events are mutually exclusive and whether two events are independent. • Calculate probabilities using the Addition Rules and Multiplication Rules. • Construct and interpret Contingency Tables. • Construct and interpret Venn Diagrams. • Construct and interpret Tree Diagrams. It is often necessary to \"guess\" about the outcome of an event in order to make a decision. Politicians study polls to guess their likelihood of winning an election. Teachers choose a particular course of study based on what they think students can comprehend. Doctors choose the treatments needed for various diseases based on their assessment of likely results. You may have visited a casino where people play games chosen because of the belief that the likelihood of winning is good. You may have chosen your course of study based on the probable availability of jobs. You have, more than likely, used probability. In fact, you probably have an intuitive sense of probability. Probability deals with the chance of an event occurring. Whenever you weigh the odds of whether or not to do your homework or to study for an exam, you are using probability. In this chapter, you will learn how to solve probability problems using a systematic approach. Your instructor will survey your class. Count the number of students in the class today. • Raise your hand if you have any change in your pocket or purse. Record the number of raised hands. Chapter 3 | Probability Topics 175 • Raise your hand if you rode a bus within the past month. Record the number of raised hands. • Raise your hand if you answered \"yes\" to BOTH of the first two questions. Record the number of raised hands. Use the class data as estimates of the following probabilities. P(change) means the probability that a randomly chosen person in your class has change in his/her pocket or purse. P(bus) means the probability that a randomly chosen person in your class rode a bus within the last month and so on. Discuss your answers. • Find P(change). • Find P(bus). • Find P(change AND bus). Find the probability that a randomly chosen student in your class has change in his/her pocket or purse and rode a bus within the last month. • Find P(change|bus). Find the probability that a randomly chosen student has change given that he or she rode a bus within the last month. Count all the students that rode a bus. From the group of students who rode a bus, count those who have change. The probability is equal to those who have change and rode a bus divided by those who rode a bus. 3.1 | Terminology Probability is a measure that is associated with how certain we are of outcomes of a particular experiment or activity. An experiment is a planned operation carried out under controlled conditions. If the result is not predetermined, then the experiment is said to be a chance experiment. Flipping one fair coin twice is an example of an experiment. A result of an experiment is called an outcome. The sample space of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes. Three ways to represent a sample space are: to list the possible outcomes, to create a tree diagram, or to create a Venn diagram. The uppercase letter S is used to denote the sample space. For example, if you flip one fair coin, S = {H, T} where H = heads and T = tails are the outcomes. An event is any combination of outcomes. Upper case letters like A and B represent events. For example, if the experiment is to flip one fair coin, event A might be getting at most one head. The probability of an event A is written P(A). The probability of any outcome is the long-term relative frequency of that outcome. Probabilities are between zero and one, inclusive (that is, zero and one and all numbers between these values). P(A) = 0 means the event A can never happen. P(A) = 1 means the event A always happens. P(A) = 0.5 means the event A is equally likely to occur or not to occur. For example, if you flip one fair coin repeatedly (from 20 to 2,000 to 20,000 times) the relative frequency of heads approaches 0.5 (the probability of heads). Equally likely means that each outcome of an experiment occurs with equal probability. For example, if you toss a fair, six-sided die, each face (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) is as likely to occur as any other face. If you toss a fair coin, a Head (H) and a Tail (T) are equally likely to occur. If you randomly guess the answer to a true/false question on an exam, you are equally likely to select a correct answer or an incorrect answer. To calculate the probability of an event A when all outcomes in the sample space are equally likely, count the number of outcomes for event A and divide by the total number of outcomes in the sample space. For example, if you toss a fair dime and a fair nickel, the sample space is {HH, TH, HT, TT} where T = tails and H = heads. The sample space has four outcomes. A = getting one head. There are two outcomes that meet this condition {HT, TH}, so P(A) = 2 4= 0.5. Suppose you roll one fair six-sided die, with the numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} on its faces. Let event E = rolling a number that is at least five. There are two outcomes {5, 6}. P(E) = 2 6 . If you were to roll the die only a few times, you would not be surprised if your observed results did not match the probability. If you were to roll the die a very large number of times, you would expect that, overall, 2 6of the rolls would result in an outcome of \"at least five\". You would not expect exactly 2 6 . The long-term relative frequency of obtaining this result would approach the theoretical probability of 2 6as the number of repetitions grows larger and larger. 176 Chapter 3 | Probability Topics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 This important characteristic of probability experiments is known as the law of large numbers which states that as the number of repetitions of an experiment is increased, the relative frequency obtained in the experiment tends to become closer and closer to the theoretical probability. Even though the outcomes do not happen according to any set pattern or order, overall, the long-term observed relative frequency will approach the theoretical probability. (The word empirical is often used instead of the word observed.) It is important to realize that in many situations, the outcomes are not equally likely. A coin or die may be unfair, or biased. Two math professors in Europe had their statistics students test the Belgian one Euro coin and discovered that in 250 trials, a head was obtained 56% of the time and a tail was obtained 44% of the time. The data seem to show that the coin is not a fair coin; more repetitions would be helpful to draw a more accurate conclusion about such bias. Some dice may be biased. Look at the dice in a game you have at home; the spots on each face are usually small holes carved out and then painted to make the spots visible. Your dice may or may not be biased; it is possible that the outcomes may be affected by the slight weight differences due to the different numbers of holes in the faces. Gambling casinos make a lot of money depending on outcomes from rolling dice, so casino dice are made differently to eliminate bias. Casino dice have flat faces; the holes are completely filled with paint having the same density as the material that the dice are made out of so that each face is equally likely to occur. Later we will learn techniques to use to work with probabilities for events that are not equally likely. \"OR\" Event: An outcome is in the event A OR B if the outcome is in A or is in B or is in both A and B. For example, let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. A OR B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. Notice that 4 and 5 are NOT listed twice. \"AND\" Event: An outcome is in the event A AND B if the outcome is in both A and B at the same time. For example, let A and B be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, respectively. Then A AND B = {4, 5}. The complement of event A is denoted A′ (read \"A prime\"). A′ consists of all outcomes that are NOT in A. Notice that P(A) + P(A′) = 1. For example, let S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and let A = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Then, A′ = {5, 6}. P(A) = 4 6 , P(A′) = 2 6 , and P(A) + P(A′) = 4 6 + 2 6= 1 The conditional probability of A given B is written P(A|B). P(A|B) is the probability that event A will occur given that the event B has already occurred. A conditional reduces the sample space. We calculate the probability of A from the reduced sample space B. The formula to calculate P(A|B) is P(A|B) = P(AANDB) P(B) where P(B) is greater than zero. For example, suppose we toss one fair, six-sided die. The sample space S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Let A = face is 2 or 3 and B = face is even (2, 4, 6). To calculate P(A|B), we count the number of outcomes 2 or 3 in the sample space B = {2, 4, 6}. Then we divide that by the number of outcomes B (rather than S). We get the same result by using the formula. Remember that S has six outcomes. P(A|B) = P(AANDB) P(B) = (the number of outcomes that are 2 or 3 and even inS) 6 (the number of outcomes that are even inS) 6 = 1 6 3 6=1 3 Understanding Terminology and Symbols It is important to read each problem carefully to think about and understand what the events are. Understanding the wording is the first very important step in solving probability problems. Reread the problem several times if necessary. Clearly identify the event of interest. Determine whether there is a condition stated in the wording that would indicate that the probability is conditional; carefully identify the condition, if any.

Independent Events Two events are independent if the following are true: • P(A|B) = P(A) • P(B|A) = P(B) • P(A AND B) = P(A)P(B) Two events A and B are independent if the knowledge that one occurred does not affect the chance the other occurs. For example, the outcomes of two roles of a fair die are independent events. The outcome of the first roll does not change the probability for the outcome of the second roll. To show two events are independent, you must show only one of the above conditions. If two events are NOT independent, then we say that they are dependent. Sampling may be done with replacement or without replacement. • With replacement: If each member of a population is replaced after it is picked, then that member has the possibility of being chosen more than once. When sampling is done with replacement, then events are considered to be independent, meaning the result of the first pick will not change the probabilities for the second pick. • Without replacement: When sampling is done without replacement, each member of a population may be chosen only once. In this case, the probabilities for the second pick are affected by the result of the first pick. The events are considered to be dependent or not independent. If it is not known whether A and B are independent or dependent, assume they are dependent until you can show otherwise. Example 3.4 You have a fair, well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. It consists of four suits. The suits are clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades. There are 13 cards in each suit consisting of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J (jack), Q (queen), K (king) of that suit. a. Sampling with replacement: Suppose you pick three cards with replacement. The first card you pick out of the 52 cards is the Q of spades. You put this card back, reshuffle the cards and pick a second card from the 52-card deck. It is the ten of clubs. You put this card back, reshuffle the cards and pick a third card from the 52-card deck. This time, the card is the Q of spades again. Your picks are {Q of spades, ten of clubs, Q of spades}. You have picked the Q of spades twice. You pick each card from the 52-card deck. b. Sampling without replacement: Suppose you pick three cards without replacement. The first card you pick out of the 52 cards is the K of hearts. You put this card aside and pick the second card from the 51 cards remaining in the deck. It is the three of diamonds. You put this card aside and pick the third card from the remaining 50 cards in the deck. The third card is the J of spades. Your picks are {K of hearts, three of diamonds, J of spades}. Because you have picked the cards without replacement, you cannot pick the same card twice. 3.4 You have a fair, well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. It consists of four suits. The suits are clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades. There are 13 cards in each suit consisting of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J (jack), Q (queen), K (king) of that suit. Three cards are picked at random. a. Suppose you know that the picked cards are Q of spades, K of hearts and Q of spades. Can you decide if the sampling was with or without replacement? Chapter 3 | Probability Topics 181 b. Suppose you know that the picked cards are Q of spades, K of hearts, and J of spades. Can you decide if the sampling was with or without replacement? Example 3.5 You have a fair, well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. It consists of four suits. The suits are clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades. There are 13 cards in each suit consisting of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J (jack), Q (queen), and K (king) of that suit. S = spades, H = Hearts, D = Diamonds, C = Clubs. a. Suppose you pick four cards, but do not put any cards back into the deck. Your cards are QS, 1D, 1C, QD. b. Suppose you pick four cards and put each card back before you pick the next card. Your cards are KH, 7D, 6D, KH. Which of a. or b. did you sample with replacement and which did you sample without replacement? Solution 3.5 a. Without replacement; b. With replacement 3.5 You have a fair, well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. It consists of four suits. The suits are clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades. There are 13 cards in each suit consisting of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J (jack), Q (queen), and K (king) of that suit. S = spades, H = Hearts, D = Diamonds, C = Clubs. Suppose that you sample four cards without replacement. Which of the following outcomes are possible? Answer the same question for sampling with replacement. a. QS, 1D, 1C, QD b. KH, 7D, 6D, KH c. QS, 7D, 6D, KS Mutually Exclusive Events A and B are mutually exclusive events if they cannot occur at the same time. This means that A and B do not share any outcomes and P(A AND B) = 0. For example, suppose the sample space S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, and C = {7, 9}. A AND B = {4, 5}. P(A AND B) = 2 10 and is not equal to zero. Therefore, A and B are not mutually exclusive. A and C do not have any numbers in common so P(A AND C) = 0. Therefore, A and C are mutually exclusive. If it is not known whether A and B are mutually exclusive, assume they are not until you can show otherwise. The following examples illustrate these definitions and terms. Example 3.6 Flip two fair coins. (This is an experiment.) The sample space is {HH, HT, TH, TT} where T = tails and H = heads. The outcomes are HH, HT, TH, and TT. The outcomes HT and TH are different. The HT means that the first coin showed heads and the second coin showed tails. The TH means that the first coin showed tails and the second coin showed heads. • Let A = the event of getting at most one tail. (At most one tail means zero or one tail.) Then A can be written as {HH, HT, TH}. The outcome HH shows zero tails. HT and TH each show one tail. 182 Chapter 3 | Probability Topics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 • Let B = the event of getting all tails. B can be written as {TT}. B is the complement of A, so B = A′. Also, P(A) + P(B) = P(A) + P(A′) = 1. • The probabilities for A and for B are P(A) = 3 4and P(B) = 1 4 . • Let C = the event of getting all heads. C = {HH}. Since B = {TT}, P(B AND C) = 0. B and C are mutually exclusive. (B and C have no members in common because you cannot have all tails and all heads at the same time.) • Let D = event of getting more than one tail. D = {TT}. P(D) = 1 4 • Let E = event of getting a head on the first roll. (This implies you can get either a head or tail on the second roll.) E = {HT, HH}. P(E) = 2 4 • Find the probability of getting at least one (one or two) tail in two flips. Let F = event of getting at least one tail in two flips. F = {HT, TH, TT}. P(F) = 3 4 3.6 Draw two cards from a standard 52-card deck with replacement. Find the probability of getting at least one black card. Example 3.7 Flip two fair coins. Find the probabilities of the events. a. Let F = the event of getting at most one tail (zero or one tail). b. Let G = the event of getting two faces that are the same. c. Let H = the event of getting a head on the first flip followed by a head or tail on the second flip. d. Are F and G mutually exclusive? e. Let J = the event of getting all tails. Are J and H mutually exclusive? Solution 3.7 Look at the sample space in Example 3.6. a. Zero (0) or one (1) tails occur when the outcomes HH, TH, HT show up. P(F) = 3 4 b. Two faces are the same if HH or TT show up. P(G) = 2 4 c. A head on the first flip followed by a head or tail on the second flip occurs when HH or HT show up. P(H) = 2 4 d. F and G share HH so P(F AND G) is not equal to zero (0). F and G are not mutually exclusive. e. Getting all tails occurs when tails shows up on both coins (TT). H’s outcomes are HH and HT. J and H have nothing in common so P(J AND H) = 0. J and H are mutually exclusive. Chapter 3 | Probability Topics 183 3.7 A box has two balls, one white and one red. We select one ball, put it back in the box, and select a second ball (sampling with replacement). Find the probability of the following events: a. Let F = the event of getting the white ball twice. b. Let G = the event of getting two balls of different colors. c. Let H = the event of getting white on the first pick. d. Are F and G mutually exclusive? e. Are G and H mutually exclusive? Example 3.8 Roll one fair, six-sided die. The sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Let event A = a face is odd. Then A = {1, 3, 5}. Let event B = a face is even. Then B = {2, 4, 6}. • Find the complement of A, A′. The complement of A, A′, is B because A and B together make up the sample space. P(A) + P(B) = P(A) + P(A′) = 1. Also, P(A) = 3 6and P(B) = 3 6 . • Let event C = odd faces larger than two. Then C = {3, 5}. Let event D = all even faces smaller than five. Then D = {2, 4}. P(C AND D) = 0 because you cannot have an odd and even face at the same time. Therefore, C and D are mutually exclusive events. • Let event E = all faces less than five. E = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Are C and E mutually exclusive events? (Answer yes or no.) Why or why not? Solution 3.8 No. C = {3, 5} and E = {1, 2, 3, 4}. P(C AND E) = 1 6 . To be mutually exclusive, P(C AND E) must be zero. • Find P(C|A). This is a conditional probability. Recall that the event C is {3, 5} and event A is {1, 3, 5}. To find P(C|A), find the probability of C using the sample space A. You have reduced the sample space from the original sample space {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} to {1, 3, 5}. So, P(C|A) = 2 3 . 3.8 Let event A = learning Spanish. Let event B = learning German. Then A AND B = learning Spanish and German. Suppose P(A) = 0.4 and P(B) = 0.2. P(A AND B) = 0.08. Are events A and B independent? Hint: You must show ONE of the following: • P(A|B) = P(A) • P(B|A) = P(B) • P(A AND B) = P(A)P(B) Example 3.9 Let event G = taking a math class. Let event H = taking a science class. Then, G AND H = taking a math class and a science class. Suppose P(G) = 0.6, P(H) = 0.5, and P(G AND H) = 0.3. Are G and H independent? 184 Chapter 3 | Probability Topics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 If G and H are independent, then you must show ONE of the following: • P(G|H) = P(G) • P(H|G) = P(H) • P(G AND H) = P(G)P(H) NOTE The choice you make depends on the information you have. You could choose any of the methods here because you have the necessary information. a. Show that P(G|H) = P(G). Solution 3.9 P(G|H) = P(G AND H) P(H) = 0.3 0.5= 0.6 = P(G) b. Show P(G AND H) = P(G)P(H). Solution 3.9 P(G)P(H) = (0.6)(0.5) = 0.3 = P(G AND H) Since G and H are independent, knowing that a person is taking a science class does not change the chance that he or she is taking a math class. If the two events had not been independent (that is, they are dependent) then knowing that a person is taking a science class would change the chance he or she is taking math. For practice, show that P(H|G) = P(H) to show that G and H are independent events. 3.9 In a bag, there are six red marbles and four green marbles. The red marbles are marked with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Justify your answers to the following questions numerically. a. Are C and D independent? b. Are C and D mutually exclusive? c. What is P(D|C)? Chapter 3 | Probability Topics 185 Solution 3.10 a. Yes, because P(C|D) = P(C). b. No, because P(C AND D) is not equal to zero. c. P(D|C) = P(C AND D) P(C) = 0.225 0.75 = 0.3 3.10 A student goes to the library.

Are B and D independent? d. Are B and D mutually exclusive? Example 3.11 In a box there are three red cards and five blue cards. The red cards are marked with the numbers 1, 2, and 3, and the blue cards are marked with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The cards are well-shuffled. You reach into the box (you cannot see into it) and draw one card. Let R = red card is drawn, B = blue card is drawn, E = even-numbered card is drawn. The sample space S = R1, R2, R3, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5. S has eight outcomes. • P(R) = 3 8 . P(B) = 5 8 . P(R AND B) = 0. (You cannot draw one card that is both red and blue.) • P(E) = 3 8 . (There are three even-numbered cards, R2, B2, and B4.) • P(E|B) = 2 5 . (There are five blue cards: B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5. Out of the blue cards, there are two even cards; B2 and B4.) • P(B|E) = 2 3 . (There are three even-numbered cards: R2, B2, and B4. Out of the even-numbered cards, to are blue; B2 and B4.) • The events R and B are mutually exclusive because P(R AND B) = 0. • Let G = card with a number greater than 3. G = {B4, B5}. P(G) = 2 8 . Let H = blue card numbered between one and four, inclusive. H = {B1, B2, B3, B4}. P(G|H) = 1 4 . (The only card in H that has a number greater than three is B4.) Since 2 8= 1 4 , P(G) = P(G|H), which means that G and H are independent. 3.11 In a basketball arena, 186 Chapter 3 | Probability Topics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 • 70% of the fans are rooting for the home team. • 25% of the fans are wearing blue. • 20% of the fans are wearing blue and are rooting for the away team. • Of the fans rooting for the away team, 67% are wearing blue. Let A be the event that a fan is rooting for the away team. Let B be the event that a fan is wearing blue. Are the events of rooting for the away team and wearing blue independent? Are they mutually exclusive? Example 3.12 In a particular college class, 60% of the students are female. Fifty percent of all students in the class have long hair. Forty-five percent of the students are female and have long hair. Of the female students, 75% have long hair. Let F be the event that a student is female. Let L be the event that a student has long hair. One student is picked randomly. Are the events of being female and having long hair independent? • The following probabilities are given in this example: • P(F) = 0.60; P(L) = 0.50 • P(F AND L) = 0.45 • P(L|F) = 0.75 NOTE The choice you make depends on the information you have. You could use the first or last condition on the list for this example. You do not know P(F|L) yet, so you cannot use the second condition. Solution 1 Check whether P(F AND L) = P(F)P(L). We are given that P(F AND L) = 0.45, but P(F)P(L) = (0.60)(0.50) = 0.30. The events of being female and having long hair are not independent because P(F AND L) does not equal P(F)P(L). Solution 2 Check whether P(L|F) equals P(L). We are given that P(L|F) = 0.75, but P(L) = 0.50; they are not equal. The events of being female and having long hair are not independent. Interpretation of Results The events of being female and having long hair are not independent; knowing that a student is female changes the probability that a student has long hair. 3.12 Mark is deciding which route to take to work. His choices are I = the Interstate and F = Fifth Street. • P(I) = 0.44 and P(F) = 0.56 • P(I AND F) = 0 because Mark will take only one route to work. What is the probability of P(I OR F)?

Toss one fair, six-sided die (the die has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 dots on a side). The outcomes are ________________. Count the outcomes. There are ___ outcomes. c. Multiply the two numbers of outcomes. The answer is _______. d. If you flip one fair coin and follow it with the toss of one fair, six-sided die, the answer in part c. is the number of outcomes (size of the sample space). What are the outcomes? (Hint: Two of the outcomes are H1 and T6.) e. Event A = heads (H) on the coin followed by an even number (2, 4, 6) on the die. A = {_________________}. Find P(A). f. Event B = heads on the coin followed by a three on the die. B = {________}. Find P(B). g. Are A and B mutually exclusive? (Hint: What is P(A AND B)? If P(A AND B) = 0, then A and B are mutually exclusive.) h. Are A and B independent? (Hint: Is P(A AND B) = P(A)P(B)? If P(A AND B) = P(A)P(B), then A and B are independent. If not, then they are dependent). Solution 3.13 a. H and T; 2 b. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; 6 c. 2(6) = 12 d. T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 e. A = {H2, H4, H6}; P(A) = 3 12 f. B = {H3}; P(B) = 1 12 g. Yes, because P(A AND B) = 0 h. P(A AND B) = 0.P(A)P(B) = ⎛ ⎝ 3 12 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 1 12 ⎞ ⎠. P(A AND B) does not equal P(A)P(B), so A and B are dependent. 3.13 A box has two balls, one white and one red. We select one ball, put it back in the box, and select a second ball (sampling with replacement). Let T be the event of getting the white ball twice, F the event of picking the white ball first, S the event of picking the white ball in the second drawing. a. Compute P(T). b. Compute P(T|F). c. Are T and F independent?. d. Are F and S mutually exclusive? e. Are F and S independent? 3.3 | Two Basic Rules of Probability When calculating probability, there are two rules to consider when determining if two events are independent or dependent and if they are mutually exclusive or not. 188 Chapter 3 | Probability Topics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 The Multiplication Rule If A and B are two events defined on a sample space, then: P(A AND B) = P(B)P(A|B). This rule may also be written as: P(A|B) = P(A AND B) P(B) (The probability of A given B equals the probability of A and B divided by the probability of B.) If A and B are independent, then P(A|B) = P(A). Then P(A AND B) = P(A|B)P(B) becomes P(A AND B) = P(A)P(B). The Addition Rule If A and B are defined on a sample space, then: P(A OR B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A AND B). If A and B are mutually exclusive, then P(A AND B) = 0. Then P(A OR B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A AND B) becomes P(A OR B) = P(A) + P(B). Example 3.14 Klaus is trying to choose where to go on vacation. His two choices are: A = New Zealand and B = Alaska • Klaus can only afford one vacation. The probability that he chooses A is P(A) = 0.6 and the probability that he chooses B is P(B) = 0.35. • P(A AND B) = 0 because Klaus can only afford to take one vacation • Therefore, the probability that he chooses either New Zealand or Alaska is P(A OR B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.6 + 0.35 = 0.95. Note that the probability that he does not choose to go anywhere on vacation must be 0.05. Example 3.15 Carlos plays college soccer. He makes a goal 65% of the time he shoots. Carlos is going to attempt two goals in a row in the next game. A = the event Carlos is successful on his first attempt. P(A) = 0.65. B = the event Carlos is successful on his second attempt. P(B) = 0.65. Carlos tends to shoot in streaks. The probability that he makes the second goal GIVEN that he made the first goal is 0.90. a. What is the probability that he makes both goals? Solution 3.15 a. The problem is asking you to find P(A AND B) = P(B AND A). Since P(B|A) = 0.90: P(B AND A) = P(B|A) P(A) = (0.90)(0.65) = 0.585 Carlos makes the first and second goals with probability 0.585. b. What is the probability that Carlos makes either the first goal or the second goal? Solution 3.15 b. The problem is asking you to find P(A OR B). P(A OR B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A AND B) = 0.65 + 0.65 - 0.585 = 0.715 Carlos makes either the first goal or the second goal with probability 0.715. c. Are A and B independent? Solution 3.15 c. No, they are not, because P(B AND A) = 0.585. Chapter 3 | Probability Topics 189 P(B)P(A) = (0.65)(0.65) = 0.423 0.423 ≠ 0.585 = P(B AND A) So, P(B AND A) is not equal to P(B)P(A). d. Are A and B mutually exclusive? Solution 3.15 d. No, they are not because P(A and B) = 0.585. To be mutually exclusive, P(A AND B) must equal zero. 3.15 Helen plays basketball. For free throws, she makes the shot 75% of the time. Helen must now attempt two free throws. C = the event that Helen makes the first shot. P(C) = 0.75. D = the event Helen makes the second shot. P(D) = 0.75. The probability that Helen makes the second free throw given that she made the first is 0.85. What is the probability that Helen makes both free throws? Example 3.16 A community swim team has 150 members. Seventy-five of the members are advanced swimmers. Forty- seven of the members are intermediate swimmers. The remainder are novice swimmers. Forty of the advanced swimmers practice four times a week. Thirty of the intermediate swimmers practice four times a week. Ten of the novice swimmers practice four times a week. Suppose one member of the swim team is chosen randomly. a. What is the probability that the member is a novice swimmer? Solution 3.16 a. 28 150 b. What is the probability that the member practices four times a week? Solution 3.16 b. 80 150 c. What is the probability that the member is an advanced swimmer and practices four times a week? Solution 3.16 c. 40 150 d. What is the probability that a member is an advanced swimmer and an intermediate swimmer? Are being an advanced swimmer and an intermediate swimmer mutually exclusive? Why or why not? Solution 3.16 d. P(advanced AND intermediate) = 0, so these are mutually exclusive events. A swimmer cannot be an advanced 190 Chapter 3 | Probability Topics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 swimmer and an intermediate swimmer at the same time. e. Are being a novice swimmer and practicing four times a week independent events? Why or why not? Solution 3.16 e. No, these are not independent events. P(novice AND practices four times per week) = 0.0667 P(novice)P(practices four times per week) = 0.0996 0.0667 ≠ 0.0996 3.16 A school has 200 seniors of whom 140 will be going to college next year. Forty will be going directly to work. The remainder are taking a gap year. Fifty of the seniors going to college play sports. Thirty of the seniors going directly to work play sports. Five of the seniors taking a gap year play sports. What is the probability that a senior is taking a gap year? Example 3.17 Felicity attends Modesto JC in Modesto, CA. The probability that Felicity enrolls in a math class is 0.2 and the probability that she enrolls in a speech class is 0.65. The probability that she enrolls in a math class GIVEN that she enrolls in speech class is 0.25. Let: M = math class, S = speech class, M|S = math given speech a. What is the probability that Felicity enrolls in math and speech? Find P(M AND S) = P(M|S)P(S). b. What is the probability that Felicity enrolls in math or speech classes? Find P(M OR S) = P(M) + P(S) - P(M AND S). c. Are M and S independent? Is P(M|S) = P(M)? d. Are M and S mutually exclusive? Is P(M AND S) = 0? Solution 3.17 a. 0.1625, b. 0.6875, c. No, d. No 3.17 A student goes to the library. Let events B = the student checks out a book and D = the student check out a DVD. Suppose that P(B) = 0.40, P(D) = 0.30 and P(D|B) = 0.5. a. Find P(B AND D). b. Find P(B OR D). Example 3.18 Studies show that about one woman in seven (approximately 14.3%) who live to be 90 will develop breast cancer. Suppose that of those women who develop breast cancer, a test is negative 2% of the time. Also suppose that in Chapter 3 | Probability Topics 191 the general population of women, the test for breast cancer is negative about 85% of the time. Let B = woman develops breast cancer and let N = tests negative. Suppose one woman is selected at random. a. What is the probability that the woman develops breast cancer? What is the probability that woman tests negative? Solution 3.18 a. P(B) = 0.143; P(N) = 0.85 b. Given that the woman has breast cancer, what is the probability that she tests negative? Solution 3.18 b. P(N|B) = 0.02 c. What is the probability that the woman has breast cancer AND tests negative? Solution 3.18 c. P(B AND N) = P(B)P(N|B) = (0.143)(0.02) = 0.0029 d. What is the probability that the woman has breast cancer or tests negative? Solution 3.18 d. P(B OR N) = P(B) + P(N) - P(B AND N) = 0.143 + 0.85 - 0.0029 = 0.9901 e. Are having breast cancer and testing negative independent events? Solution 3.18 e. No. P(N) = 0.85; P(N|B) = 0.02. So, P(N|B) does not equal P(N). f. Are having breast cancer and testing negative mutually exclusive? Solution 3.18 f. No. P(B AND N) = 0.0029. For B and N to be mutually exclusive, P(B AND N) must be zero. 3.18 A school has 200 seniors of whom 140 will be going to college next year. Forty will be going directly to work.

The table helps in determining conditional probabilities quite easily. The table displays sample values in relation to two different variables that may be dependent or contingent on one another. Later on, we will use contingency tables again, but in another manner. Example 3.20 Suppose a study of speeding violations and drivers who use cell phones produced the following fictional data: Speeding violation in the last year No speeding violation in the last year Total Uses cell phone while driving 25 280 305 Does not use cell phone while driving 45 405 450 Total 70 685 755 Table 3.2 The total number of people in the sample is 755. The row totals are 305 and 450. The column totals are 70 and 685. Notice that 305 + 450 = 755 and 70 + 685 = 755. Calculate the following probabilities using the table. a. Find P(Driver is a cell phone user). b. Find P(driver had no violation in the last year). c. Find P(Driver had no violation in the last year AND was a cell phone user). d. Find P(Driver is a cell phone user OR driver had no violation in the last year). e. Find P(Driver is a cell phone user GIVEN driver had a violation in the last year). f. Find P(Driver had no violation last year GIVEN driver was not a cell phone user) Chapter 3 | Probability Topics 193 Solutions: a. number of cell phone users total number in study = 305 755 b. number that had no violation total number in study = 685 755 c. 280 755 d. ⎛ ⎝ 305 755 + 685 755 ⎞ ⎠ − 280 755 = 710 755 e. 25 70 (The sample space is reduced to the number of drivers who had a violation.) f. 405 450 (The sample space is reduced to the number of drivers who were not cell phone users.) 3.20 Table 3.3 shows the number of athletes who stretch before exercising and how many had injuries within the past year.

Tree diagrams and Venn diagrams are two tools that can be used to visualize and solve conditional probabilities. Tree Diagrams A tree diagram is a special type of graph used to determine the outcomes of an experiment. It consists of \"branches\" that are labeled with either frequencies or probabilities. Tree diagrams can make some probability problems easier to visualize and solve. The following example illustrates how to use a tree diagram. Example 3.24 In an urn, there are 11 balls. Three balls are red (R) and eight balls are blue (B). Draw two balls, one at a time, with replacement. \"With replacement\" means that you put the first ball back in the urn before you select the second ball. The tree diagram using frequencies that show all the possible outcomes follows. Figure 3.2 Total = 64 + 24 + 24 + 9 = 121 The first set of branches represents the first draw. The second set of branches represents the second draw. Each of the outcomes is distinct. In fact, we can list each red ball as R1, R2, and R3 and each blue ball as B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, and B8. Then the nine RR outcomes can be written as: R1R1; R1R2; R1R3; R2R1; R2R2; R2R3; R3R1; R3R2; R3R3 The other outcomes are similar. There are a total of 11 balls in the urn. Draw two balls, one at a time, with replacement. There are 11(11) = 121 outcomes, the size of the sample space. a. List the 24 BR outcomes: B1R1, B1R2, B1R3, ... Solution 3.24 a. B1R1; B1R2; B1R3; B2R1; B2R2; B2R3; B3R1; B3R2; B3R3; B4R1; B4R2; B4R3; B5R1; B5R2; B5R3; B6R1; B6R2; B6R3; B7R1; B7R2; B7R3; B8R1; B8R2; B8R3 b. Using the tree diagram, calculate P(RR). Solution 3.24 b. P(RR) = ⎛ ⎝ 3 11 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 3 11 ⎞ ⎠= 9 121 Chapter 3 | Probability Topics 199 c. Using the tree diagram, calculate P(RB OR BR). Solution 3.24 c. P(RB OR BR) = ⎛ ⎝ 3 11 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 8 11 ⎞ ⎠+ ⎛ ⎝ 8 11 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 3 11 ⎞ ⎠= 48 121 d. Using the tree diagram, calculate P(R on 1st draw AND B on 2nd draw). Solution 3.24 d. P(R on 1st draw AND B on 2nd draw) = P(RB) = ⎛ ⎝ 3 11 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 8 11 ⎞ ⎠= 24 121 e. Using the tree diagram, calculate P(R on 2nd draw GIVEN B on 1st draw). Solution 3.24 e. P(R on 2nd draw GIVEN B on 1st draw) = P(R on 2nd|B on 1st) = 24 88 = 3 11 This problem is a conditional one. The sample space has been reduced to those outcomes that already have a blue on the first draw. There are 24 + 64 = 88 possible outcomes (24 BR and 64 BB). Twenty-four of the 88 possible outcomes are BR. 24 88 = 3 11 . f. Using the tree diagram, calculate P(BB). Solution 3.24 f. P(BB) = 64 121 g. Using the tree diagram, calculate P(B on the 2nd draw given R on the first draw). Solution 3.24 g. P(B on 2nd draw|R on 1st draw) = 8 11 There are 9 + 24 outcomes that have R on the first draw (9 RR and 24 RB). The sample space is then 9 + 24 = 33. 24 of the 33 outcomes have B on the second draw. The probability is then 24 33 . 3.24 In a standard deck, there are 52 cards. 12 cards are face cards (event F) and 40 cards are not face cards (event N). Draw two cards, one at a time, with replacement. All possible outcomes are shown in the tree diagram as frequencies. Using the tree diagram, calculate P(FF). 200 Chapter 3 | Probability Topics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Figure 3.3 Example 3.25 An urn has three red marbles and eight blue marbles in it. Draw two marbles, one at a time, this time without replacement, from the urn. \"Without replacement\" means that you do not put the first ball back before you select the second marble. Following is a tree diagram for this situation. The branches are labeled with probabilities instead of frequencies. The numbers at the ends of the branches are calculated by multiplying the numbers on the two corresponding branches, for example, ⎛ ⎝ 3 11 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 2 10 ⎞ ⎠= 6 110 . Figure 3.4 Total = 56 + 24 + 24 + 6 110 =110 110 = 1 Chapter 3 | Probability Topics 201 NOTE If you draw a red on the first draw from the three red possibilities, there are two red marbles left to draw on the second draw. You do not put back or replace the first marble after you have drawn it. You draw without replacement, so that on the second draw there are ten marbles left in the urn. Calculate the following probabilities using the tree diagram. a. P(RR) = ________ Solution 3.25 a. P(RR) = ⎛ ⎝ 3 11 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 2 10 ⎞ ⎠= 6 110 b.

Do the Experiment Count out 40 mixed-color M&Ms® which is approximately one small bag’s worth. Record the number of each color in Table 3.11. Use the information from this table to complete Table 3.12. Next, put the M&Ms in a cup. The experiment is to pick two M&Ms, one at a time. Do not look at them as you pick them. The first time through, replace the first M&M before picking the second one. Record the results in the “With Replacement” column of Table 3.13. Do this 24 times. The second time through, after picking the first M&M, do not replace it before picking the second one. Then, pick the second one. Record the results in the “Without Replacement” column section of Table 3.14. After you record the pick, put both M&Ms back. Do this a total of 24 times, also. Use the data from Table 3.14 to calculate the empirical probability questions. Leave your answers in unreduced fractional form. Do not multiply out any fractions.

If two events are NOT independent, then we say that they are dependent. Each outcome of an experiment has the same probability. a subset of the set of all outcomes of an experiment; the set of all outcomes of an experiment is called a sample space and is usually denoted by S. An event is an arbitrary subset in S. It can contain one outcome, two outcomes, no outcomes (empty subset), the entire sample space, and the like. Standard notations for events are capital letters such as A, B, C, and so on. a planned activity carried out under controlled conditions The occurrence of one event has no effect on the probability of the occurrence of another event. Events A and B are independent if one of the following is true: 1. P(A|B) = P(A) 2. P(B|A) = P(B) 3. P(A AND B) = P(A)P(B) Two events are mutually exclusive if the probability that they both happen at the same time is zero. If events A and B are mutually exclusive, then P(A AND B) = 0. a particular result of an experiment a number between zero and one, inclusive, that gives the likelihood that a specific event will occur; the foundation of statistics is given by the following 3 axioms (by A.N. Kolmogorov, 1930’s): Let S denote the sample space and A and B are two events in S. Then: • 0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1 • If A and B are any two mutually exclusive events, then P(A OR B) = P(A) + P(B). • P(S) = 1 the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment If each member of a population is replaced after it is picked, then that member has the possibility of being chosen more than once. When sampling is done without replacement, each member of a population may be chosen only once. An outcome is in the event A AND B if the outcome is in both A AND B at the same time. The complement of event A consists of all outcomes that are NOT in A. P(A|B) is the probability that event A will occur given that the event B has already occurred. P(A|B) is the probability that event A will occur given that the event B has already occurred. An outcome is in the event A OR B if the outcome is in A or is in B or is in both A and B. An outcome is in the event A OR B if the outcome is in A, is in B, or is in both A and B. the useful visual representation of a sample space and events in the form of a “tree” with branches Chapter 3 | Probability Topics 213 Venn Diagram marked by possible outcomes together with associated probabilities (frequencies, relative frequencies) the visual representation of a sample space and events in the form of circles or ovals showing their intersections CHAPTER REVIEW 3.1 Terminology In this module we learned the basic terminology of probability. The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is called the sample space. Events are subsets of the sample space, and they are assigned a probability that is a number between zero and one, inclusive. 3.2 Independent and Mutually Exclusive Events Two events A and B are independent if the knowledge that one occurred does not affect the chance the other occurs. If two events are not independent, then we say that they are dependent. In sampling with replacement, each member of a population is replaced after it is picked, so that member has the possibility of being chosen more than once, and the events are considered to be independent. In sampling without replacement, each member of a population may be chosen only once, and the events are considered not to be independent. When events do not share outcomes, they are mutually exclusive of each other. 3.3 Two Basic Rules of Probability The multiplication rule and the addition rule are used for computing the probability of A and B, as well as the probability of A or B for two given events A, B defined on the sample space. In sampling with replacement each member of a population is replaced after it is picked, so that member has the possibility of being chosen more than once, and the events are considered to be independent. In sampling without replacement, each member of a population may be chosen only once, and the events are considered to be not independent. The events A and B are mutually exclusive events when they do not have any outcomes in common. 3.4 Contingency Tables There are several tools you can use to help organize and sort data when calculating probabilities. Contingency tables help display data and are particularly useful when calculating probabilites that have multiple dependent variables. 3.5 Tree and Venn Diagrams A tree diagram use branches to show the different outcomes of experiments and makes complex probability questions easy to visualize. A Venn diagram is a picture that represents the outcomes of an experiment. It generally consists of a box that represents the sample space S together with circles or ovals. The circles or ovals represent events. A Venn diagram is especially helpful for visualizing the OR event, the AND event, and the complement of an event and for understanding conditional probabilities. FORMULA REVIEW 3.1 Terminology A and B are events P(S) = 1 where S is the sample space 0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1 P(A|B) = P(AANDB) P(B) 3.2 Independent and Mutually Exclusive Events If A and B are independent, P(A AND B) = P(A)P(B), P(A|B) = P(A) and P(B|A) = P(B). If A and B are mutually exclusive, P(A OR B) = P(A) + P(B) and P(A AND B) = 0. 3.3 Two Basic Rules of Probability The multiplication rule: P(A AND B) = P(A|B)P(B) 214 Chapter 3 | Probability Topics This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 The addition rule: P(A OR B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A AND B) PRACTICE 3.1 Terminology 1.

They were grouped into the following categories: Homosexual/Bisexual IV Drug User* Heterosexual Contact Other Totals Female 0 70 136 49 ____ Male 2,146 463 60 135 ____ Totals ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ Table 3.25 * includes homosexual/bisexual IV drug users Suppose a person with AIDS in Santa Clara County is randomly selected. a. Find P(Person is female). b. Find P(Person has a risk factor heterosexual contact). c. Find P(Person is female OR has a risk factor of IV drug user). d. Find P(Person is female AND has a risk factor of homosexual/bisexual). e. Find P(Person is male AND has a risk factor of IV drug user). f. Find P(Person is female GIVEN person got the disease from heterosexual contact). g. Construct a Venn diagram. Make one group females and the other group heterosexual contact. 128. Answer these questions using probability rules. Do NOT use the contingency table. Three thousand fifty-nine cases of AIDS had been reported in Santa Clara County, CA, through a certain date. Those cases will be our population. Of those cases, 6.4% obtained the disease through heterosexual contact and 7.4% are female. Out of the females with the disease, 53.3% got the disease from heterosexual contact. a. Find P(Person is female). b. Find P(Person obtained the disease through heterosexual contact). c. Find P(Person is female GIVEN person got the disease from heterosexual contact) d. Construct a Venn diagram representing this situation. Make one group females and the other group heterosexual contact. Fill in all values as probabilities. REFERENCES 3.1 Terminology “Countries List by Continent.” Worldatlas, 2013.

(Credit: Leszek Leszczynski) Introduction Chapter Objectives By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: • Recognize and understand discrete probability distribution functions, in general. • Calculate and interpret expected values. • Recognize the binomial probability distribution and apply it appropriately. • Recognize the Poisson probability distribution and apply it appropriately. • Recognize the geometric probability distribution and apply it appropriately. • Recognize the hypergeometric probability distribution and apply it appropriately. • Classify discrete word problems by their distributions. A student takes a ten-question, true-false quiz. Because the student had such a busy schedule, he or she could not study and guesses randomly at each answer. What is the probability of the student passing the test with at least a 70%? Small companies might be interested in the number of long-distance phone calls their employees make during the peak time of the day. Suppose the average is 20 calls. What is the probability that the employees make more than 20 long-distance phone calls during the peak time? Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables 243 These two examples illustrate two different types of probability problems involving discrete random variables. Recall that discrete data are data that you can count. A random variable describes the outcomes of a statistical experiment in words. The values of a random variable can vary with each repetition of an experiment. Random Variable Notation Upper case letters such as X or Y denote a random variable. Lower case letters like x or y denote the value of a random variable. If X is a random variable, then X is written in words, and x is given as a number. For example, let X = the number of heads you get when you toss three fair coins. The sample space for the toss of three fair coins is TTT; THH; HTH; HHT; HTT; THT; TTH; HHH. Then, x = 0, 1, 2, 3. X is in words and x is a number. Notice that for this example, the x values are countable outcomes. Because you can count the possible values that X can take on and the outcomes are random (the x values 0, 1, 2, 3), X is a discrete random variable. Toss a coin ten times and record the number of heads. After all members of the class have completed the experiment (tossed a coin ten times and counted the number of heads), fill in Table 4.1. Let X = the number of heads in ten tosses of the coin. x Frequency of x Relative Frequency of x Table 4.1 a. Which value(s) of x occurred most frequently? b. If you tossed the coin 1,000 times, what values could x take on? Which value(s) of x do you think would occur most frequently? c. What does the relative frequency column sum to? 4.1 | Probability Distribution Function (PDF) for a Discrete Random Variable A discrete probability distribution function has two characteristics: 1. Each probability is between zero and one, inclusive. 2. The sum of the probabilities is one. Example 4.1 A child psychologist is interested in the number of times a newborn baby's crying wakes its mother after midnight. For a random sample of 50 mothers, the following information was obtained. Let X = the number of times per week a newborn baby's crying wakes its mother after midnight. For this example, x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 244 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 P(x) = probability that X takes on a value x. x P(x) 0 P(x = 0) = 2 50 1 P(x = 1) = 11 50 2 P(x = 2) = 23 50 3 P(x = 3) = 9 50 4 P(x = 4) = 4 50 5 P(x = 5) = 1 50 Table 4.2 X takes on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This is a discrete PDF because: a. Each P(x) is between zero and one, inclusive. b. The sum of the probabilities is one, that is, 2 50 + 11 50 + 23 50 + 9 50 + 4 50 + 1 50 = 1 4.1 A hospital researcher is interested in the number of times the average post-op patient will ring the nurse during a 12-hour shift. For a random sample of 50 patients, the following information was obtained. Let X = the number of times a patient rings the nurse during a 12-hour shift. For this exercise, x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. P(x) = the probability that X takes on value x. Why is this a discrete probability distribution function (two reasons)? X P(x) 0 P(x = 0) = 4 50 1 P(x = 1) = 8 50 2 P(x = 2) = 16 50 3 P(x = 3) = 14 50 4 P(x = 4) = 6 50 Table 4.3 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables 245 X P(x) 5 P(x = 5) = 2 50 Table 4.3 Example 4.2 Suppose Nancy has classes three days a week. She attends classes three days a week 80% of the time, two days 15% of the time, one day 4% of the time, and no days 1% of the time. Suppose one week is randomly selected. a. Let X = the number of days Nancy ____________________. Solution 4.2 a. Let X = the number of days Nancy attends class per week. b. X takes on what values? Solution 4.2 b. 0, 1, 2, and 3 c. Suppose one week is randomly chosen. Construct a probability distribution table (called a PDF table) like the one in Example 4.1. The table should have two columns labeled x and P(x). What does the P(x) column sum to? Solution 4.2 c. x P(x) 0 0.01 1 0.04 2 0.15 3 0.80 Table 4.4 4.2 Jeremiah has basketball practice two days a week. Ninety percent of the time, he attends both practices. Eight percent of the time, he attends one practice. Two percent of the time, he does not attend either practice. What is X and what values does it take on? 246 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 4.2 | Mean or Expected Value and Standard Deviation The expected value is often referred to as the \"long-term\" average or mean. This means that over the long term of doing an experiment over and over, you would expect this average. You toss a coin and record the result. What is the probability that the result is heads? If you flip a coin two times, does probability tell you that these flips will result in one heads and one tail? You might toss a fair coin ten times and record nine heads. As you learned in Section 3., probability does not describe the short-term results of an experiment. It gives information about what can be expected in the long term. To demonstrate this, Karl Pearson once tossed a fair coin 24,000 times! He recorded the results of each toss, obtaining heads 12,012 times. In his experiment, Pearson illustrated the Law of Large Numbers. The Law of Large Numbers states that, as the number of trials in a probability experiment increases, the difference between the theoretical probability of an event and the relative frequency approaches zero (the theoretical probability and the relative frequency get closer and closer together). When evaluating the long-term results of statistical experiments, we often want to know the “average” outcome. This “long-term average” is known as the mean or expected value of the experiment and is denoted by the Greek letter μ. In other words, after conducting many trials of an experiment, you would expect this average value. NOTE To find the expected value or long term average, μ, simply multiply each value of the random variable by its probability and add the products. Example 4.3 A men's soccer team plays soccer zero, one, or two days a week. The probability that they play zero days is 0.2, the probability that they play one day is 0.5, and the probability that they play two days is 0.3. Find the long-term average or expected value, μ, of the number of days per week the men's soccer team plays soccer. To do the problem, first let the random variable X = the number of days the men's soccer team plays soccer per week. X takes on the values 0, 1, 2. Construct a PDF table adding a column x*P(x). In this column, you will multiply each x value by its probability. x P(x) x*P(x) 0 0.2 (0)(0.2) = 0 1 0.5 (1)(0.5) = 0.5 2 0.3 (2)(0.3) = 0.6 Table 4.5 Expected Value Table This table is called an expected value table. The table helps you calculate the expected value or long-term average. Add the last column x*P(x) to find the long term average or expected value: (0)(0.2) + (1)(0.5) + (2)(0.3) = 0 + 0.5 + 0.6 = 1.1. The expected value is 1.1. The men's soccer team would, on the average, expect to play soccer 1.1 days per week. The number 1.1 is the long-term average or expected value if the men's soccer team plays soccer week after week after week. We say μ = 1.1. Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables 247 Example 4.4 Find the expected value of the number of times a newborn baby's crying wakes its mother after midnight. The expected value is the expected number of times per week a newborn baby's crying wakes its mother after midnight. Calculate the standard deviation of the variable as well. x P(x) x*P(x) (x – μ)2 ⋅ P(x) 0 P(x = 0) = 2 50 (0) ⎛ ⎝ 2 50 ⎞ ⎠= 0 (0 – 2.1) 2 ⋅ 0.04 = 0.1764 1 P(x = 1) = ⎛ ⎝ 11 50 ⎞ ⎠ (1) ⎛ ⎝ 11 50 ⎞ ⎠= 11 50(1 – 2.1) 2 ⋅ 0.22 = 0.2662 2 P(x = 2) = 23 50 (2) ⎛ ⎝ 23 50 ⎞ ⎠= 46 50(2 – 2.1) 2 ⋅ 0.46 = 0.0046 3 P(x = 3) = 9 50 (3) ⎛ ⎝ 9 50 ⎞ ⎠= 27 50(3 – 2.1) 2 ⋅ 0.18 = 0.1458 4 P(x = 4) = 4 50 (4) ⎛ ⎝ 4 50 ⎞ ⎠= 16 50(4 – 2.1) 2 ⋅ 0.08 = 0.2888 5 P(x = 5) = 1 50 (5) ⎛ ⎝ 1 50 ⎞ ⎠= 5 50(5 – 2.1) 2 ⋅ 0.02 = 0.1682 Table 4.6 You expect a newborn to wake its mother after midnight 2.1 times per week, on the average. Add the values in the third column of the table to find the expected value of X: μ = Expected Value = 105 50 = 2.1 Use μ to complete the table. The fourth column of this table will provide the values you need to calculate the standard deviation. For each value x, multiply the square of its deviation by its probability. (Each deviation has the format x – μ). Add the values in the fourth column of the table: 0.1764 + 0.2662 + 0.0046 + 0.1458 + 0.2888 + 0.1682 = 1.05 The standard deviation of X is the square root of this sum: σ = 1.05≈ 1.0247 248 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 4.4 A hospital researcher is interested in the number of times the average post-op patient will ring the nurse during a 12-hour shift. For a random sample of 50 patients, the following information was obtained. What is the expected value? x P(x) 0 P(x = 0) = 4 50 1 P(x = 1) = 8 50 2 P(x = 2) = 16 50 3 P(x = 3) = 14 50 4 P(x = 4) = 6 50 5 P(x = 5) = 2 50 Table 4.7 Example 4.5 Suppose you play a game of chance in which five numbers are chosen from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. A computer randomly selects five numbers from zero to nine with replacement. You pay $2 to play and could profit $100,000 if you match all five numbers in order (you get your $2 back plus $100,000). Over the long term, what is your expected profit of playing the game? To do this problem, set up an expected value table for the amount of money you can profit. Let X = the amount of money you profit. The values of x are not 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Since you are interested in your profit (or loss), the values of x are 100,000 dollars and −2 dollars. To win, you must get all five numbers correct, in order. The probability of choosing one correct number is 1 10 because there are ten numbers. You may choose a number more than once. The probability of choosing all five numbers correctly and in order is ⎛ ⎝ 1 10 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 1 10 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 1 10 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 1 10 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 1 10 ⎞ ⎠= (1)(10 −5) = 0.00001. Therefore, the probability of winning is 0.00001 and the probability of losing is 1 − 0.00001 = 0.99999. The expected value table is as follows: Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables 249 x P(x) x*P(x) Loss –2 0.99999 (–2)(0.99999) = –1.99998 Profit 100,000 0.00001 (100000)(0.00001) = 1 Table 4.8 Αdd the last column. –1.99998 + 1 = –0.99998 Since –0.99998 is about –1, you would, on average, expect to lose approximately $1 for each game you play. However, each time you play, you either lose $2 or profit $100,000. The $1 is the average or expected LOSS per game after playing this game over and over. 4.5 You are playing a game of chance in which four cards are drawn from a standard deck of 52 cards. You guess the suit of each card before it is drawn. The cards are replaced in the deck on each draw. You pay $1 to play. If you guess the right suit every time, you get your money back and $256. What is your expected profit of playing the game over the long term? Example 4.6 Suppose you play a game with a biased coin. You play each game by tossing the coin once. P(heads) = 2 3and P(tails) = 1 3 . If you toss a head, you pay $6. If you toss a tail, you win $10. If you play this game many times, will you come out ahead? a. Define a random variable X. Solution 4.6 a. X = amount of profit b. Complete the following expected value table. x ____ ____ WIN 10 1 3 ____ LOSE ____ ____ –12 3 Table 4.9 Solution 4.6 b. 250 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 x P(x) xP(x) WIN 10 1 3 10 3 LOSE –6 2 3 –12 3 Table 4.10 c. What is the expected value, μ? Do you come out ahead? Solution 4.6 c. Add the last column of the table. The expected value μ = –2 3. You lose, on average, about 67 cents each time you play the game so you do not come out ahead. 4.6 Suppose you play a game with a spinner. You play each game by spinning the spinner once. P(red) = 2 5 , P(blue) = 2 5 , and P(green) = 1 5 . If you land on red, you pay $10. If you land on blue, you don't pay or win anything. If you land on green, you win $10. Complete the following expected value table. x P(x) Red –20 5 Blue 2 5 Green 10 Table 4.11 Like data, probability distributions have standard deviations. To calculate the standard deviation (σ) of a probability distribution, find each deviation from its expected value, square it, multiply it by its probability, add the products, and take the square root. To understand how to do the calculation, look at the table for the number of days per week a men's soccer team plays soccer. To find the standard deviation, add the entries in the column labeled (x – μ)2P(x) and take the square root. x P(x) x*P(x) (x – μ)2P(x) 0 0.2 (0)(0.2) = 0 (0 – 1.1)2(0.2) = 0.242 1 0.5 (1)(0.5) = 0.5 (1 – 1.1)2(0.5) = 0.005 Table 4.12 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables 251 x P(x) x*P(x) (x – μ)2P(x) 2 0.3 (2)(0.3) = 0.6 (2 – 1.1)2(0.3) = 0.243 Table 4.12 Add the last column in the table. 0.242 + 0.005 + 0.243 = 0.490. The standard deviation is the square root of 0.49, or σ = 0.49= 0.7 Generally for probability distributions, we use a calculator or a computer to calculate μ and σ to reduce roundoff error. For some probability distributions, there are short-cut formulas for calculating μ and σ. Example 4.7 Toss a fair, six-sided die twice. Let X = the number of faces that show an even number. Construct a table like Table 4.11 and calculate the mean μ and standard deviation σ of X. Solution 4.7 Tossing one fair six-sided die twice has the same sample space as tossing two fair six-sided dice. The sample space has 36 outcomes: (1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 5) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 6) Table 4.13 Use the sample space to complete the following table: x P(x) xP(x) (x – μ)2 ⋅ P(x) 0 9 36 0 (0 – 1) 2 ⋅ 9 36 = 9 36 1 18 36 18 36 (1 – 1) 2 ⋅ 18 36 = 0 2 9 36 18 36 (1 – 1) 2 ⋅ 9 36 = 9 36 Table 4.14 Calculating μ and σ. Add the values in the third column to find the expected value: μ = 36 36 = 1. Use this value to complete the fourth column. Add the values in the fourth column and take the square root of the sum: σ = 18 36 ≈ 0.7071. 252 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Example 4.8 On May 11, 2013 at 9:30 PM, the probability that moderate seismic activity (one moderate earthquake) would occur in the next 48 hours in Iran was about 21.42%. Suppose you make a bet that a moderate earthquake will occur in Iran during this period. If you win the bet, you win $50. If you lose the bet, you pay $20. Let X = the amount of profit from a bet. P(win) = P(one moderate earthquake will occur) = 21.42% P(loss) = P(one moderate earthquake will not occur) = 100% – 21.42% If you bet many times, will you come out ahead? Explain your answer in a complete sentence using numbers. What is the standard deviation of X? Construct a table similar to Table 4.12 and Table 4.12 to help you answer these questions. Solution 4.8 x P(x) x(Px) (x – μ)2P(x) win 50 0.2142 10.71 [50 – (–5.006)] 2(0.2142) = 648.0964 loss –20 0.7858 –15.716 [–20 – (–5.006)] 2(0.7858) = 176.6636 Table 4.15 Mean = Expected Value = 10.71 + (–15.716) = –5.006. If you make this bet many times under the same conditions, your long term outcome will be an average loss of $5.01 per bet. Standard Deviation = 648.0964 + 176.6636≈ 28.7186 4.8 On May 11, 2013 at 9:30 PM, the probability that moderate seismic activity (one moderate earthquake) would occur in the next 48 hours in Japan was about 1.08%. As in Example 4.8, you bet that a moderate earthquake will occur in Japan during this period. If you win the bet, you win $100. If you lose the bet, you pay $10. Let X = the amount of profit from a bet. Find the mean and standard deviation of X. Some of the more common discrete probability functions are binomial, geometric, hypergeometric, and Poisson. Most elementary courses do not cover the geometric, hypergeometric, and Poisson. Your instructor will let you know if he or she wishes to cover these distributions. A probability distribution function is a pattern. You try to fit a probability problem into a pattern or distribution in order to perform the necessary calculations. These distributions are tools to make solving probability problems easier. Each distribution has its own special characteristics. Learning the characteristics enables you to distinguish among the different distributions. 4.3 | Binomial Distribution There are three characteristics of a binomial experiment. 1. There are a fixed number of trials. Think of trials as repetitions of an experiment. The letter n denotes the number of trials. 2. There are only two possible outcomes, called \"success\" and \"failure,\" for each trial. The letter p denotes the probability of a success on one trial, and q denotes the probability of a failure on one trial. p + q = 1. Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables 253 3. The n trials are independent and are repeated using identical conditions. Because the n trials are independent, the outcome of one trial does not help in predicting the outcome of another trial. Another way of saying this is that for each individual trial, the probability, p, of a success and probability, q, of a failure remain the same. For example, randomly guessing at a true-false statistics question has only two outcomes. If a success is guessing correctly, then a failure is guessing incorrectly. Suppose Joe always guesses correctly on any statistics true-false question with probability p = 0.6. Then, q = 0.4. This means that for every true-false statistics question Joe answers, his probability of success (p = 0.6) and his probability of failure (q = 0.4) remain the same. The outcomes of a binomial experiment fit a binomial probability distribution. The random variable X = the number of successes obtained in the n independent trials. The mean, μ, and variance, σ2, for the binomial probability distribution are μ = np and σ2 = npq. The standard deviation, σ, is then σ = npq. Any experiment that has characteristics two and three and where n = 1 is called a Bernoulli Trial (named after Jacob Bernoulli who, in the late 1600s, studied them extensively). A binomial experiment takes place when the number of successes is counted in one or more Bernoulli Trials. Example 4.9 At ABC College, the withdrawal rate from an elementary physics course is 30% for any given term. This implies that, for any given term, 70% of the students stay in the class for the entire term. A \"success\" could be defined as an individual who withdrew. The random variable X = the number of students who withdraw from the randomly selected elementary physics class. 4.9 The state health board is concerned about the amount of fruit available in school lunches. Forty-eight percent of schools in the state offer fruit in their lunches every day. This implies that 52% do not. What would a \"success\" be in this case? Example 4.10 Suppose you play a game that you can only either win or lose. The probability that you win any game is 55%, and the probability that you lose is 45%. Each game you play is independent. If you play the game 20 times, write the function that describes the probability that you win 15 of the 20 times. Here, if you define X as the number of wins, then X takes on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 20. The probability of a success is p = 0.55. The probability of a failure is q = 0.45. The number of trials is n = 20. The probability question can be stated mathematically as P(x = 15). 4.10 A trainer is teaching a dolphin to do tricks. The probability that the dolphin successfully performs the trick is 35%, and the probability that the dolphin does not successfully perform the trick is 65%. Out of 20 attempts, you want to find the probability that the dolphin succeeds 12 times. State the probability question mathematically. Example 4.11 A fair coin is flipped 15 times. Each flip is independent. What is the probability of getting more than ten heads? 254 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Let X = the number of heads in 15 flips of the fair coin. X takes on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 15. Since the coin is fair, p = 0.5 and q = 0.5. The number of trials is n = 15. State the probability question mathematically. Solution 4.11 P(x > 10) 4.11 A fair, six-sided die is rolled ten times. Each roll is independent. You want to find the probability of rolling a one more than three times. State the probability question mathematically. Example 4.12 Approximately 70% of statistics students do their homework in time for it to be collected and graded. Each student does homework independently. In a statistics class of 50 students, what is the probability that at least 40 will do their homework on time? Students are selected randomly. a. This is a binomial problem because there is only a success or a __________, there are a fixed number of trials, and the probability of a success is 0.70 for each trial. Solution 4.12 a. failure b. If we are interested in the number of students who do their homework on time, then how do we define X? Solution 4.12 b. X = the number of statistics students who do their homework on time c. What values does x take on? Solution 4.12 c. 0, 1, 2, …, 50 d. What is a \"failure,\" in words? Solution 4.12 d. Failure is defined as a student who does not complete his or her homework on time. The probability of a success is p = 0.70. The number of trials is n = 50. e. If p + q = 1, then what is q? Solution 4.12 e. q = 0.30 f. The words \"at least\" translate as what kind of inequality for the probability question P(x ____ 40). Solution 4.12 f. greater than or equal to (≥) Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables 255 The probability question is P(x ≥ 40). 4.12 Sixty-five percent of people pass the state driver’s exam on the first try. A group of 50 individuals who have taken the driver’s exam is randomly selected. Give two reasons why this is a binomial problem. Notation for the Binomial: B = Binomial Probability Distribution Function X ~ B(n, p) Read this as \"X is a random variable with a binomial distribution.\" The parameters are n and p; n = number of trials, p = probability of a success on each trial. Example 4.13 It has been stated that about 41% of adult workers have a high school diploma but do not pursue any further education. If 20 adult workers are randomly selected, find the probability that at most 12 of them have a high school diploma but do not pursue any further education. How many adult workers do you expect to have a high school diploma but do not pursue any further education? Let X = the number of workers who have a high school diploma but do not pursue any further education. X takes on the values 0, 1, 2, ..., 20 where n = 20, p = 0.41, and q = 1 – 0.41 = 0.59. X ~ B(20, 0.41) Find P(x ≤ 12). P(x ≤ 12) = 0.9738. (calculator or computer) Go into 2nd DISTR. The syntax for the instructions are as follows: To calculate (x = value): binompdf(n, p, number) if \"number\" is left out, the result is the binomial probability table. To calculate P(x ≤ value): binomcdf(n, p, number) if \"number\" is left out, the result is the cumulative binomial probability table. For this problem: After you are in 2nd DISTR, arrow down to binomcdf. Press ENTER. Enter 20,0.41,12). The result is P(x ≤ 12) = 0.9738. NOTE If you want to find P(x = 12), use the pdf (binompdf). If you want to find P(x > 12), use 1 - binomcdf(20,0.41,12). The probability that at most 12 workers have a high school diploma but do not pursue any further education is 0.9738. The graph of X ~ B(20, 0.41) is as follows: 256 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Figure 4.2 The y-axis contains the probability of x, where X = the number of workers who have only a high school diploma. The number of adult workers that you expect to have a high school diploma but not pursue any further education is the mean, μ = np = (20)(0.41) = 8.2. The formula for the variance is σ2 = npq. The standard deviation is σ = npq. σ = (20)(0.41)(0.59)= 2.20. 4.13 About 32% of students participate in a community volunteer program outside of school. If 30 students are selected at random, find the probability that at most 14 of them participate in a community volunteer program outside of school. Use the TI-83+ or TI-84 calculator to find the answer. Example 4.14 In the 2013 Jerry’s Artarama art supplies catalog, there are 560 pages. Eight of the pages feature signature artists. Suppose we randomly sample 100 pages. Let X = the number of pages that feature signature artists. a. What values does x take on? b. What is the probability distribution? Find the following probabilities: i. the probability that two pages feature signature artists ii. the probability that at most six pages feature signature artists iii. the probability that more than three pages feature signature artists. c. Using the formulas, calculate the (i) mean and (ii) standard deviation. Solution 4.14 a. x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables 257 b. X ~ B ⎛ ⎝100, 8 560 ⎞ ⎠ i.

Let X = the number of American adults out of a random sample of 50 who prefer saving to spending. a. What is the probability distribution for X? b. Use your calculator to find the following probabilities: i. the probability that 25 adults in the sample prefer saving over spending ii. the probability that at most 20 adults prefer saving iii. the probability that more than 30 adults prefer saving c. Using the formulas, calculate the (i) mean and (ii) standard deviation of X. Example 4.15 The lifetime risk of developing pancreatic cancer is about one in 78 (1.28%). Suppose we randomly sample 200 people. Let X = the number of people who will develop pancreatic cancer. a. What is the probability distribution for X? b. Using the formulas, calculate the (i) mean and (ii) standard deviation of X. c. Use your calculator to find the probability that at most eight people develop pancreatic cancer d. Is it more likely that five or six people will develop pancreatic cancer? Justify your answer numerically. Solution 4.15 a. X ∼ B(200, 0.0128) b. i. Mean = np = 200(0.0128) = 2.56 ii. Standard Deviation = npq = (200)(0.0128)(0.9872)≈ 1.5897 c. Using the TI-83, 83+, 84 calculator with instructions as provided in Example 4.13: P(x ≤ 8) = binomcdf(200, 0.0128, 8) = 0.9988 d. P(x = 5) = binompdf(200, 0.0128, 5) = 0.0707 P(x = 6) = binompdf(200, 0.0128, 6) = 0.0298 So P(x = 5) > P(x = 6); it is more likely that five people will develop cancer than six. 258 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 4.15 During the 2013 regular NBA season, DeAndre Jordan of the Los Angeles Clippers had the highest field goal completion rate in the league. DeAndre scored with 61.3% of his shots. Suppose you choose a random sample of 80 shots made by DeAndre during the 2013 season. Let X = the number of shots that scored points. a. What is the probability distribution for X? b. Using the formulas, calculate the (i) mean and (ii) standard deviation of X. c. Use your calculator to find the probability that DeAndre scored with 60 of these shots. d. Find the probability that DeAndre scored with more than 50 of these shots. Example 4.16 The following example illustrates a problem that is not binomial. It violates the condition of independence. ABC College has a student advisory committee made up of ten staff members and six students. The committee wishes to choose a chairperson and a recorder. What is the probability that the chairperson and recorder are both students? The names of all committee members are put into a box, and two names are drawn without replacement. The first name drawn determines the chairperson and the second name the recorder. There are two trials. However, the trials are not independent because the outcome of the first trial affects the outcome of the second trial. The probability of a student on the first draw is 6 16 . The probability of a student on the second draw is 5 15 , when the first draw selects a student. The probability is 6 15 , when the first draw selects a staff member. The probability of drawing a student's name changes for each of the trials and, therefore, violates the condition of independence. 4.16 A lacrosse team is selecting a captain. The names of all the seniors are put into a hat, and the first three that are drawn will be the captains. The names are not replaced once they are drawn (one person cannot be two captains). You want to see if the captains all play the same position. State whether this is binomial or not and state why. 4.4 | Geometric Distribution There are three main characteristics of a geometric experiment. 1. There are one or more Bernoulli trials with all failures except the last one, which is a success. In other words, you keep repeating what you are doing until the first success. Then you stop. For example, you throw a dart at a bullseye until you hit the bullseye. The first time you hit the bullseye is a \"success\" so you stop throwing the dart. It might take six tries until you hit the bullseye. You can think of the trials as failure, failure, failure, failure, failure, success, STOP. 2. In theory, the number of trials could go on forever. There must be at least one trial. 3. The probability, p, of a success and the probability, q, of a failure is the same for each trial. p + q = 1 and q = 1 − p. For example, the probability of rolling a three when you throw one fair die is 1 6 . This is true no matter how many times you roll the die. Suppose you want to know the probability of getting the first three on the fifth roll. On rolls one through four, you do not get a face with a three. The probability for each of the rolls is q = 5 6 , the probability of a failure. The probability of getting a three on the fifth roll is ⎛ ⎝ 5 6 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 5 6 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 5 6 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 5 6 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 1 6 ⎞ ⎠= 0.0804 X = the number of independent trials until the first success. Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables 259 Example 4.17 You play a game of chance that you can either win or lose (there are no other possibilities) until you lose. Your probability of losing is p = 0.57. What is the probability that it takes five games until you lose? Let X = the number of games you play until you lose (includes the losing game). Then X takes on the values 1, 2, 3, ... (could go on indefinitely). The probability question is P(x = 5). 4.17 You throw darts at a board until you hit the center area. Your probability of hitting the center area is p = 0.17. You want to find the probability that it takes eight throws until you hit the center. What values does X take on? Example 4.18 A safety engineer feels that 35% of all industrial accidents in her plant are caused by failure of employees to follow instructions. She decides to look at the accident reports (selected randomly and replaced in the pile after reading) until she finds one that shows an accident caused by failure of employees to follow instructions. On average, how many reports would the safety engineer expect to look at until she finds a report showing an accident caused by employee failure to follow instructions? What is the probability that the safety engineer will have to examine at least three reports until she finds a report showing an accident caused by employee failure to follow instructions? Let X = the number of accidents the safety engineer must examine until she finds a report showing an accident caused by employee failure to follow instructions. X takes on the values 1, 2, 3, .... The first question asks you to find the expected value or the mean. The second question asks you to find P(x ≥ 3). (\"At least\" translates to a \"greater than or equal to\" symbol). 4.18 An instructor feels that 15% of students get below a C on their final exam. She decides to look at final exams (selected randomly and replaced in the pile after reading) until she finds one that shows a grade below a C. We want to know the probability that the instructor will have to examine at least ten exams until she finds one with a grade below a C. What is the probability question stated mathematically? Example 4.19 Suppose that you are looking for a student at your college who lives within five miles of you. You know that 55% of the 25,000 students do live within five miles of you. You randomly contact students from the college until one says he or she lives within five miles of you. What is the probability that you need to contact four people? This is a geometric problem because you may have a number of failures before you have the one success you desire. Also, the probability of a success stays the same each time you ask a student if he or she lives within five miles of you. There is no definite number of trials (number of times you ask a student). a. Let X = the number of ____________ you must ask ____________ one says yes. Solution 4.19 a. Let X = the number of students you must ask until one says yes. 260 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 b.

You randomly call each store until one has the ink you need. What are p and q? Notation for the Geometric: G = Geometric Probability Distribution Function X ~ G(p) Read this as \"X is a random variable with a geometric distribution.\" The parameter is p; p = the probability of a success for each trial. Example 4.20 Assume that the probability of a defective computer component is 0.02. Components are randomly selected. Find the probability that the first defect is caused by the seventh component tested. How many components do you expect to test until one is found to be defective? Let X = the number of computer components tested until the first defect is found. X takes on the values 1, 2, 3, ... where p = 0.02. X ~ G(0.02) Find P(x = 7). P(x = 7) = 0.0177. To find the probability that x = 7, • Enter 2nd, DISTR • Scroll down and select geometpdf( • Press ENTER • Enter 0.02, 7); press ENTER to see the result: P(x = 7) = 0.0177 To find the probability that x ≤ 7, follow the same instructions EXCEPT select E:geometcdf(as the distribution Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables 261 function. The probability that the seventh component is the first defect is 0.0177. The graph of X ~ G(0.02) is: Figure 4.3 The y-axis contains the probability of x, where X = the number of computer components tested. The number of components that you would expect to test until you find the first defective one is the mean, µ = 50. The formula for the mean is μ = 1 p = 1 0.02 = 50 The formula for the variance is σ2 = ⎛ ⎝ 1 p⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 1 p − 1 ⎞ ⎠= ⎛ ⎝ 1 0.02 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 1 0.02 − 1 ⎞ ⎠= 2,450 The standard deviation is σ = ⎛ ⎝ 1 p⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 1 p − 1 ⎞ ⎠= ⎛ ⎝ 1 0.02 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 1 0.02 − 1 ⎞ ⎠= 49.5 4.20 The probability of a defective steel rod is 0.01. Steel rods are selected at random. Find the probability that the first defect occurs on the ninth steel rod. Use the TI-83+ or TI-84 calculator to find the answer. Example 4.21 The lifetime risk of developing pancreatic cancer is about one in 78 (1.28%). Let X = the number of people you ask until one says he or she has pancreatic cancer. Then X is a discrete random variable with a geometric distribution: X ~ G ⎛ ⎝ 1 78 ⎞ ⎠or X ~ G(0.0128). a. What is the probability of that you ask ten people before one says he or she has pancreatic cancer? b. What is the probability that you must ask 20 people? c. Find the (i) mean and (ii) standard deviation of X. 262 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Solution 4.21 a.

The literacy rate for women in Afghanistan is 12%. Let X = the number of Afghani women you ask until one says that she is literate. a. What is the probability distribution of X? b. What is the probability that you ask five women before one says she is literate? c. What is the probability that you must ask ten women? d. Find the (i) mean and (ii) standard deviation of X. 4.5 | Hypergeometric Distribution There are five characteristics of a hypergeometric experiment. 1. You take samples from two groups. 2. You are concerned with a group of interest, called the first group. 3. You sample without replacement from the combined groups. For example, you want to choose a softball team from a combined group of 11 men and 13 women. The team consists of ten players. 4. Each pick is not independent, since sampling is without replacement. In the softball example, the probability of picking a woman first is 13 24 . The probability of picking a man second is 11 23 if a woman was picked first. It is 10 23 if a man was picked first. The probability of the second pick depends on what happened in the first pick. 5. You are not dealing with Bernoulli Trials. The outcomes of a hypergeometric experiment fit a hypergeometric probability distribution. The random variable X = the number of items from the group of interest. Example 4.22 A candy dish contains 100 jelly beans and 80 gumdrops. Fifty candies are picked at random. What is the probability that 35 of the 50 are gumdrops? The two groups are jelly beans and gumdrops. Since the probability question asks for the probability of picking gumdrops, the group of interest (first group) is gumdrops. The size of the group of interest (first group) is 80. The size of the second group is 100. The size of the sample is 50 (jelly beans or gumdrops). Let X = the number of gumdrops in the sample of 50. X takes on the values x = 0, 1, 2, ..., 50. What is the probability statement written mathematically? Solution 4.22 P(x = 35) Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables 263 4.22 A bag contains letter tiles. Forty-four of the tiles are vowels, and 56 are consonants. Seven tiles are picked at random. You want to know the probability that four of the seven tiles are vowels. What is the group of interest, the size of the group of interest, and the size of the sample? Example 4.23 Suppose a shipment of 100 DVD players is known to have ten defective players. An inspector randomly chooses 12 for inspection. He is interested in determining the probability that, among the 12 players, at most two are defective. The two groups are the 90 non-defective DVD players and the 10 defective DVD players. The group of interest (first group) is the defective group because the probability question asks for the probability of at most two defective DVD players. The size of the sample is 12 DVD players. (They may be non-defective or defective.) Let X = the number of defective DVD players in the sample of 12. X takes on the values 0, 1, 2, ..., 10. X may not take on the values 11 or 12. The sample size is 12, but there are only 10 defective DVD players. Write the probability statement mathematically. Solution 4.23 P(x ≤ 2) 4.23 A gross of eggs contains 144 eggs. A particular gross is known to have 12 cracked eggs. An inspector randomly chooses 15 for inspection. She wants to know the probability that, among the 15, at most three are cracked. What is X, and what values does it take on? Example 4.24 You are president of an on-campus special events organization. You need a committee of seven students to plan a special birthday party for the president of the college. Your organization consists of 18 women and 15 men. You are interested in the number of men on your committee. If the members of the committee are randomly selected, what is the probability that your committee has more than four men? This is a hypergeometric problem because you are choosing your committee from two groups (men and women). a. Are you choosing with or without replacement? Solution 4.24 a. without b. What is the group of interest? Solution 4.24 b. the men c. How many are in the group of interest? Solution 4.24 c. 15 men 264 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 d. How many are in the other group? Solution 4.24 d. 18 women e. Let X = _________ on the committee. What values does X take on? Solution 4.24 e. Let X = the number of men on the committee. x = 0, 1, 2, …, 7. f. The probability question is P(_______). Solution 4.24 f. P(x > 4) 4.24 A palette has 200 milk cartons. Of the 200 cartons, it is known that ten of them have leaked and cannot be sold. A stock clerk randomly chooses 18 for inspection. He wants to know the probability that among the 18, no more than two are leaking. Give five reasons why this is a hypergeometric problem. Notation for the Hypergeometric: H = Hypergeometric Probability Distribution Function X ~ H(r, b, n) Read this as \"X is a random variable with a hypergeometric distribution.\" The parameters are r, b, and n; r = the size of the group of interest (first group), b = the size of the second group, n = the size of the chosen sample. Example 4.25 A school site committee is to be chosen randomly from six men and five women. If the committee consists of four members chosen randomly, what is the probability that two of them are men? How many men do you expect to be on the committee? Let X = the number of men on the committee of four. The men are the group of interest (first group). X takes on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, where r = 6, b = 5, and n = 4. X ~ H(6, 5, 4) Find P(x = 2). P(x = 2) = 0.4545 (calculator or computer) NOTE Currently, the TI-83+ and TI-84 do not have hypergeometric probability functions. There are a number of computer packages, including Microsoft Excel, that do. The probability that there are two men on the committee is about 0.45. The graph of X ~ H(6, 5, 4) is: Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables 265 Figure 4.4 The y-axis contains the probability of X, where X = the number of men on the committee. You would expect m = 2.18 (about two) men on the committee. The formula for the mean is µ = nr r+ b =(4)(6) 6 + 5 = 2.18 4.25 An intramural basketball team is to be chosen randomly from 15 boys and 12 girls. The team has ten slots. You want to know the probability that eight of the players will be boys. What is the group of interest and the sample? 4.6 | Poisson Distribution There are two main characteristics of a Poisson experiment. 1. The Poisson probability distribution gives the probability of a number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events happen with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event. For example, a book editor might be interested in the number of words spelled incorrectly in a particular book. It might be that, on the average, there are five words spelled incorrectly in 100 pages. The interval is the 100 pages. 2. The Poisson distribution may be used to approximate the binomial if the probability of success is \"small\" (such as 0.01) and the number of trials is \"large\" (such as 1,000). You will verify the relationship in the homework exercises. n is the number of trials, and p is the probability of a \"success.\" The random variable X = the number of occurrences in the interval of interest. Example 4.26 The average number of loaves of bread put on a shelf in a bakery in a half-hour period is 12. Of interest is the number of loaves of bread put on the shelf in five minutes. The time interval of interest is five minutes. What is the probability that the number of loaves, selected randomly, put on the shelf in five minutes is three? Let X = the number of loaves of bread put on the shelf in five minutes. If the average number of loaves put on 266 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 the shelf in 30 minutes (half-hour) is 12, then the average number of loaves put on the shelf in five minutes is ⎛ ⎝ 5 30 ⎞ ⎠(12) = 2 loaves of bread. The probability question asks you to find P(x = 3). 4.26 The average number of fish caught in an hour is eight. Of interest is the number of fish caught in 15 minutes. The time interval of interest is 15 minutes. What is the average number of fish caught in 15 minutes? Example 4.27 A bank expects to receive six bad checks per day, on average. What is the probability of the bank getting fewer than five bad checks on any given day? Of interest is the number of checks the bank receives in one day, so the time interval of interest is one day. Let X = the number of bad checks the bank receives in one day. If the bank expects to receive six bad checks per day then the average is six checks per day. Write a mathematical statement for the probability question. Solution 4.27 P(x < 5) 4.27 An electronics store expects to have ten returns per day on average. The manager wants to know the probability of the store getting fewer than eight returns on any given day. State the probability question mathematically. Example 4.28 You notice that a news reporter says \"uh,\" on average, two times per broadcast. What is the probability that the news reporter says \"uh\" more than two times per broadcast. This is a Poisson problem because you are interested in knowing the number of times the news reporter says \"uh\" during a broadcast. a. What is the interval of interest? Solution 4.28 a. one broadcast b. What is the average number of times the news reporter says \"uh\" during one broadcast? Solution 4.28 b. 2 c. Let X = ____________. What values does X take on? Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables 267 Solution 4.28 c. Let X = the number of times the news reporter says \"uh\" during one broadcast. x = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... d. The probability question is P(______). Solution 4.28 d. P(x > 2) 4.28 An emergency room at a particular hospital gets an average of five patients per hour. A doctor wants to know the probability that the ER gets more than five patients per hour. Give the reason why this would be a Poisson distribution. Notation for the Poisson: P = Poisson Probability Distribution Function X ~ P(μ) Read this as \"X is a random variable with a Poisson distribution.\" The parameter is μ (or λ); μ (or λ) = the mean for the interval of interest. Example 4.29 Leah's answering machine receives about six telephone calls between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. What is the probability that Leah receives more than one call in the next 15 minutes? Let X = the number of calls Leah receives in 15 minutes. (The interval of interest is 15 minutes or 1 4hour.) x = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... If Leah receives, on the average, six telephone calls in two hours, and there are eight 15 minute intervals in two hours, then Leah receives ⎛ ⎝ 1 8 ⎞ ⎠(6) = 0.75 calls in 15 minutes, on average. So, μ = 0.75 for this problem. X ~ P(0.75) Find P(x > 1). P(x > 1) = 0.1734 (calculator or computer) • Press 1 – and then press 2nd DISTR. • Arrow down to poissoncdf. Press ENTER. • Enter (.75,1). • The result is P(x > 1) = 0.1734. 268 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 NOTE The TI calculators use λ (lambda) for the mean. The probability that Leah receives more than one telephone call in the next 15 minutes is about 0.1734: P(x > 1) = 1 − poissoncdf(0.75, 1). The graph of X ~ P(0.75) is: Figure 4.5 The y-axis contains the probability of x where X = the number of calls in 15 minutes. 4.29 A customer service center receives about ten emails every half-hour. What is the probability that the customer service center receives more than four emails in the next six minutes? Use the TI-83+ or TI-84 calculator to find the answer. Example 4.30 According to Baydin, an email management company, an email user gets, on average, 147 emails per day. Let X = the number of emails an email user receives per day. The discrete random variable X takes on the values x = 0, 1, 2 …. The random variable X has a Poisson distribution: X ~ P(147). The mean is 147 emails. a. What is the probability that an email user receives exactly 160 emails per day? b. What is the probability that an email user receives at most 160 emails per day? c. What is the standard deviation? Solution 4.30 a. P(x = 160) = poissonpdf(147, 160) ≈ 0.0180 b. P(x ≤ 160) = poissoncdf(147, 160) ≈ 0.8666 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables 269 c. Standard Deviation = σ = µ = 147≈ 12.1244 4.30 According to a recent poll by the Pew Internet Project, girls between the ages of 14 and 17 send an average of 187 text messages each day. Let X = the number of texts that a girl aged 14 to 17 sends per day. The discrete random variable X takes on the values x = 0, 1, 2 …. The random variable X has a Poisson distribution: X ~ P(187). The mean is 187 text messages. a. What is the probability that a teen girl sends exactly 175 texts per day? b. What is the probability that a teen girl sends at most 150 texts per day? c. What is the standard deviation? Example 4.31 Text message users receive or send an average of 41.5 text messages per day. a. How many text messages does a text message user receive or send per hour? b. What is the probability that a text message user receives or sends two messages per hour? c. What is the probability that a text message user receives or sends more than two messages per hour? Solution 4.31 a. Let X = the number of texts that a user sends or receives in one hour. The average number of texts received per hour is 41.5 24 ≈ 1.7292. b. X ~ P(1.7292), so P(x = 2) = poissonpdf(1.7292, 2) ≈ 0.2653 c. P(x > 2) = 1 – P(x ≤ 2) = 1 – poissoncdf(1.7292, 2) ≈ 1 – 0.7495 = 0.2505 4.31 Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport is the busiest airport in the world. On average there are 2,500 arrivals and departures each day. a. How many airplanes arrive and depart the airport per hour? b. What is the probability that there are exactly 100 arrivals and departures in one hour? c. What is the probability that there are at most 100 arrivals and departures in one hour? Example 4.32 On May 13, 2013, starting at 4:30 PM, the probability of low seismic activity for the next 48 hours in Alaska was reported as about 1.02%. Use this information for the next 200 days to find the probability that there will be low seismic activity in ten of the next 200 days. Use both the binomial and Poisson distributions to calculate the probabilities. Are they close? 270 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Solution 4.32 Let X = the number of days with low seismic activity. Using the binomial distribution: • P(x = 10) = binompdf(200, .0102, 10) ≈ 0.000039 Using the Poisson distribution: • Calculate μ = np = 200(0.0102) ≈ 2.04 • P(x = 10) = poissonpdf(2.04, 10) ≈ 0.000045 We expect the approximation to be good because n is large (greater than 20) and p is small (less than 0.05). The results are close—both probabilities reported are almost 0. 4.32 On May 13, 2013, starting at 4:30 PM, the probability of moderate seismic activity for the next 48 hours in the Kuril Islands off the coast of Japan was reported at about 1.43%. Use this information for the next 100 days to find the probability that there will be low seismic activity in five of the next 100 days. Use both the binomial and Poisson distributions to calculate the probabilities. Are they close? 4.7 | Discrete Distribution (Playing Card Experiment) Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables 271 4.1 Discrete Distribution (Playing Card Experiment) Class Time: Names: Student Learning Outcomes • The student will compare empirical data and a theoretical distribution to determine if an everyday experiment fits a discrete distribution. • The student will compare technology-generated simulation and a theoretical distribution. • The student will demonstrate an understanding of long-term probabilities.

There are only two possible outcomes called “success” and “failure” for each trial. 2. The probability p of a success is the same for any trial (so the probability q = 1 − p of a failure is the same for any trial). a statistical experiment that satisfies the following three conditions: 1. There are a fixed number of trials, n. 2. There are only two possible outcomes, called \"success\" and, \"failure,\" for each trial. The letter p denotes the probability of a success on one trial, and q denotes the probability of a failure on one trial. 3. The n trials are independent and are repeated using identical conditions. a discrete random variable (RV) that arises from Bernoulli trials; there are a fixed number, n, of independent trials. “Independent” means that the result of any trial (for example, trial one) does not affect the results of the following trials, and all trials are conducted under the same conditions. Under these circumstances the binomial RV X is defined as the number of successes in n trials. The notation is: X ~ B(n, p). The mean is μ = np and the standard deviation is σ = npq. The probability of exactly x successes in n trials is P(X = x) = ⎛ ⎝ n x ⎞ ⎠pxqn − x. expected arithmetic average when an experiment is repeated many times; also called the mean. Notations: μ. For a discrete random variable (RV) with probability distribution function P(x),the definition can also be written in the form μ = ∑ xP(x). a discrete random variable (RV) that arises from the Bernoulli trials; the trials are repeated until the first success. The geometric variable X is defined as the number of trials until the first success. Notation: X ~ G(p). The mean is μ = 1 p and the standard deviation is σ = 1 p⎛ ⎝ 1 p − 1 ⎞ ⎠. The probability of exactly x failures before the first success is given by the formula: P(X = x) = p(1 – p)x – 1. a statistical experiment with the following properties: 1. There are one or more Bernoulli trials with all failures except the last one, which is a success. 2. In theory, the number of trials could go on forever. There must be at least one trial. 3. The probability, p, of a success and the probability, q, of a failure do not change from trial to trial. a statistical experiment with the following properties: 1. You take samples from two groups. 2. You are concerned with a group of interest, called the first group. 3. You sample without replacement from the combined groups. 4. Each pick is not independent, since sampling is without replacement. 5. You are not dealing with Bernoulli Trials. a discrete random variable (RV) that is characterized by: 1. A fixed number of trials. 2. The probability of success is not the same from trial to trial. We sample from two groups of items when we are interested in only one group. X is defined as the number of successes out of the total number of items chosen. Notation: X ~ H(r, b, n), where r = the number of items in the group of interest, b = the number of items in the group not of interest, and n = the number of items chosen. a number that measures the central tendency; a common name for mean is ‘average.’ The term ‘mean’ is a shortened form of ‘arithmetic mean.’ By definition, the mean for a sample (detonated by x¯ ) is 278 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Mean of a Probability Distribution Poisson Probability Distribution Probability Distribution Function (PDF) Random Variable (RV) Standard Deviation of a Probability Distribution The Law of Large Numbers x¯ =Sum of all values in the sample Number of values in the sample and the mean for a population (denoted by μ) is μ = Sum of all values in the population Number of values in the population . the long-term average of many trials of a statistical experiment a discrete random variable (RV) that counts the number of times a certain event will occur in a specific interval; characteristics of the variable: • The probability that the event occurs in a given interval is the same for all intervals. • The events occur with a known mean and independently of the time since the last event. The distribution is defined by the mean μ of the event in the interval. Notation: X ~ P(μ). The mean is μ = np. The standard deviation is σ = µ . The probability of having exactly x successes in r trials is P(X = x ) = (e−µ) µ x x! . The Poisson distribution is often used to approximate the binomial distribution, when n is “large” and p is “small” (a general rule is that n should be greater than or equal to 20 and p should be less than or equal to 0.05). a mathematical description of a discrete random variable (RV), given either in the form of an equation (formula) or in the form of a table listing all the possible outcomes of an experiment and the probability associated with each outcome. a characteristic of interest in a population being studied; common notation for variables are upper case Latin letters X, Y, Z,...; common notation for a specific value from the domain (set of all possible values of a variable) are lower case Latin letters x, y, and z. For example, if X is the number of children in a family, then x represents a specific integer 0, 1, 2, 3,.... Variables in statistics differ from variables in intermediate algebra in the two following ways. • The domain of the random variable (RV) is not necessarily a numerical set; the domain may be expressed in words; for example, if X = hair color then the domain is {black, blond, gray, green, orange}. • We can tell what specific value x the random variable X takes only after performing the experiment. a number that measures how far the outcomes of a statistical experiment are from the mean of the distribution As the number of trials in a probability experiment increases, the difference between the theoretical probability of an event and the relative frequency probability approaches zero. CHAPTER REVIEW 4.1 Probability Distribution Function (PDF) for a Discrete Random Variable The characteristics of a probability distribution function (PDF) for a discrete random variable are as follows: 1. Each probability is between zero and one, inclusive (inclusive means to include zero and one). 2. The sum of the probabilities is one. 4.2 Mean or Expected Value and Standard Deviation The expected value, or mean, of a discrete random variable predicts the long-term results of a statistical experiment that has been repeated many times. The standard deviation of a probability distribution is used to measure the variability of possible outcomes. 4.3 Binomial Distribution A statistical experiment can be classified as a binomial experiment if the following conditions are met: 1. There are a fixed number of trials, n. 2. There are only two possible outcomes, called \"success\" and, \"failure\" for each trial. The letter p denotes the Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables 279 probability of a success on one trial and q denotes the probability of a failure on one trial. 3. The n trials are independent and are repeated using identical conditions. The outcomes of a binomial experiment fit a binomial probability distribution. The random variable X = the number of successes obtained in the n independent trials. The mean of X can be calculated using the formula μ = np, and the standard deviation is given by the formula σ = npq. 4.4 Geometric Distribution There are three characteristics of a geometric experiment: 1. There are one or more Bernoulli trials with all failures except the last one, which is a success. 2. In theory, the number of trials could go on forever. There must be at least one trial. 3. The probability, p, of a success and the probability, q, of a failure are the same for each trial. In a geometric experiment, define the discrete random variable X as the number of independent trials until the first success. We say that X has a geometric distribution and write X ~ G(p) where p is the probability of success in a single trial. The mean of the geometric distribution X ~ G(p) is μ = 1 p and the standard deviation is σ ⎛ ⎝1 −p ⎞ ⎠ p2 = 1 p⎛ ⎝ 1 p − 1 ⎞ ⎠. 4.5 Hypergeometric Distribution A hypergeometric experiment is a statistical experiment with the following properties: 1. You take samples from two groups. 2. You are concerned with a group of interest, called the first group. 3. You sample without replacement from the combined groups. 4. Each pick is not independent, since sampling is without replacement. 5. You are not dealing with Bernoulli Trials. The outcomes of a hypergeometric experiment fit a hypergeometric probability distribution. The random variable X = the number of items from the group of interest. The distribution of X is denoted X ~ H(r, b, n), where r = the size of the group of interest (first group), b = the size of the second group, and n = the size of the chosen sample. It follows that n ≤ r + b. The mean of X is μ = nr r + b and the standard deviation is σ = rbn(r + b − n) (r + b) 2 (r + b − 1) . 4.6 Poisson Distribution A Poisson probability distribution of a discrete random variable gives the probability of a number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, if these events happen at a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event. The Poisson distribution may be used to approximate the binomial, if the probability of success is \"small\" (less than or equal to 0.05) and the number of trials is \"large\" (greater than or equal to 20).

X = the number of successes in n independent trials n = the number of independent trials X takes on the values x = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n 280 Chapter 4 | Discrete Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 p = the probability of a success for any trial q = the probability of a failure for any trial p + q = 1 q = 1 – p The mean of X is μ = np. The standard deviation of X is σ = npq. 4.4 Geometric Distribution X ~ G(p) means that the discrete random variable X has a geometric probability distribution with probability of success in a single trial p. X = the number of independent trials until the first success X takes on the values x = 1, 2, 3, ... p = the probability of a success for any trial q = the probability of a failure for any trial p + q = 1 q = 1 – p The mean is μ = 1 p . The standard deviation is σ = 1 – p p2 = 1 p⎛ ⎝ 1 p − 1 ⎞ ⎠. 4.5 Hypergeometric Distribution X ~ H(r, b, n) means that the discrete random variable X has a hypergeometric probability distribution with r = the size of the group of interest (first group), b = the size of the second group, and n = the size of the chosen sample. X = the number of items from the group of interest that are in the chosen sample, and X may take on the values x = 0, 1, ..., up to the size of the group of interest. (The minimum value for X may be larger than zero in some instances.) n ≤ r + b The mean of X is given by the formula μ = nr r + b and the standard deviation is = rbn(r + b −n) (r + b) 2(r + b − 1) . 4.6 Poisson Distribution X ~ P(μ) means that X has a Poisson probability distribution where X = the number of occurrences in the interval of interest. X takes on the values x = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... The mean μ is typically given. The variance is σ2 = μ, and the standard deviation is σ = µ . When P(μ) is used to approximate a binomial distribution, μ = np where n represents the number of independent trials and p represents the probability of success in a single trial.

(Credit: Rev Stan) Introduction Chapter Objectives By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: • Recognize and understand continuous probability density functions in general. • Recognize the uniform probability distribution and apply it appropriately. • Recognize the exponential probability distribution and apply it appropriately. Continuous random variables have many applications. Baseball batting averages, IQ scores, the length of time a long distance telephone call lasts, the amount of money a person carries, the length of time a computer chip lasts, and SAT scores are just a few. The field of reliability depends on a variety of continuous random variables. Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables 311 NOTE The values of discrete and continuous random variables can be ambiguous. For example, if X is equal to the number of miles (to the nearest mile) you drive to work, then X is a discrete random variable. You count the miles. If X is the distance you drive to work, then you measure values of X and X is a continuous random variable. For a second example, if X is equal to the number of books in a backpack, then X is a discrete random variable. If X is the weight of a book, then X is a continuous random variable because weights are measured. How the random variable is defined is very important. Properties of Continuous Probability Distributions The graph of a continuous probability distribution is a curve. Probability is represented by area under the curve. The curve is called the probability density function (abbreviated as pdf). We use the symbol f(x) to represent the curve. f(x) is the function that corresponds to the graph; we use the density function f(x) to draw the graph of the probability distribution. Area under the curve is given by a different function called the cumulative distribution function (abbreviated as cdf). The cumulative distribution function is used to evaluate probability as area. • The outcomes are measured, not counted. • The entire area under the curve and above the x-axis is equal to one. • Probability is found for intervals of x values rather than for individual x values. • P(c < x < d) is the probability that the random variable X is in the interval between the values c and d. P(c < x < d) is the area under the curve, above the x-axis, to the right of c and the left of d. • P(x = c) = 0 The probability that x takes on any single individual value is zero. The area below the curve, above the x-axis, and between x = c and x = c has no width, and therefore no area (area = 0). Since the probability is equal to the area, the probability is also zero. • P(c < x < d) is the same as P(c ≤ x ≤ d) because probability is equal to area. We will find the area that represents probability by using geometry, formulas, technology, or probability tables. In general, calculus is needed to find the area under the curve for many probability density functions. When we use formulas to find the area in this textbook, the formulas were found by using the techniques of integral calculus. However, because most students taking this course have not studied calculus, we will not be using calculus in this textbook. There are many continuous probability distributions. When using a continuous probability distribution to model probability, the distribution used is selected to model and fit the particular situation in the best way. In this chapter and the next, we will study the uniform distribution, the exponential distribution, and the normal distribution. The following graphs illustrate these distributions. Figure 5.2 The graph shows a Uniform Distribution with the area between x = 3 and x = 6 shaded to represent the probability that the value of the random variable X is in the interval between three and six. 312 Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Figure 5.3 The graph shows an Exponential Distribution with the area between x = 2 and x = 4 shaded to represent the probability that the value of the random variable X is in the interval between two and four. Figure 5.4 The graph shows the Standard Normal Distribution with the area between x = 1 and x = 2 shaded to represent the probability that the value of the random variable X is in the interval between one and two. 5.1 | Continuous Probability Functions We begin by defining a continuous probability density function. We use the function notation f(x). Intermediate algebra may have been your first formal introduction to functions. In the study of probability, the functions we study are special. We define the function f(x) so that the area between it and the x-axis is equal to a probability. Since the maximum probability is one, the maximum area is also one. For continuous probability distributions, PROBABILITY = AREA. Example 5.1 Consider the function f(x) = 1 20 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 20. x = a real number. The graph of f(x) = 1 20 is a horizontal line. However, since 0 ≤ x ≤ 20, f(x) is restricted to the portion between x = 0 and x = 20, inclusive. Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables 313 Figure 5.5 f(x) = 1 20 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 20. The graph of f(x) = 1 20 is a horizontal line segment when 0 ≤ x ≤ 20. The area between f(x) = 1 20 where 0 ≤ x ≤ 20 and the x-axis is the area of a rectangle with base = 20 and height = 1 20 . AREA = 20 ⎛ ⎝ 1 20 ⎞ ⎠= 1 Suppose we want to find the area between f(x) = 1 20 and the x-axis where 0 < x < 2. Figure 5.6 AREA = (2 – 0) ⎛ ⎝ 1 20 ⎞ ⎠ = 0.1 (2 – 0) = 2 = base of a rectangle REMINDER area of a rectangle = (base)(height). The area corresponds to a probability. The probability that x is between zero and two is 0.1, which can be written 314 Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 mathematically as P(0 < x < 2) = P(x < 2) = 0.1. Suppose we want to find the area between f(x) = 1 20 and the x-axis where 4 < x < 15. Figure 5.7 AREA = (15 – 4) ⎛ ⎝ 1 20 ⎞ ⎠ = 0.55 (15 – 4) = 11 = the base of a rectangle The area corresponds to the probability P(4 < x < 15) = 0.55. Suppose we want to find P(x = 15). On an x-y graph, x = 15 is a vertical line. A vertical line has no width (or zero width). Therefore, P(x = 15) = (base)(height) = (0) ⎛ ⎝ 1 20 ⎞ ⎠= 0 Figure 5.8 P(X ≤ x), which can also be written as P(X < x) for continuous distributions, is called the cumulative distribution function or CDF. Notice the \"less than or equal to\" symbol. We can also use the CDF to calculate P(X > x). The CDF gives \"area to the left\" and P(X > x) gives \"area to the right.\" We calculate P(X > x) for continuous distributions as follows: P(X > x) = 1 – P (X < x). Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables 315 Figure 5.9 Label the graph with f(x) and x. Scale the x and y axes with the maximum x and y values. f(x) = 1 20 , 0 ≤ x ≤ 20. To calculate the probability that x is between two values, look at the following graph. Shade the region between x = 2.3 and x = 12.7. Then calculate the shaded area of a rectangle. Figure 5.10 P(2.3 <x< 12.7) = (base)(height) = (12.7 − 2.3) ⎛ ⎝ 1 20 ⎞ ⎠= 0.52 5.1 Consider the function f(x) = 1 8for 0 ≤ x ≤ 8. Draw the graph of f(x) and find P(2.5 < x < 7.5). 5.2 | The Uniform Distribution The uniform distribution is a continuous probability distribution and is concerned with events that are equally likely to occur. When working out problems that have a uniform distribution, be careful to note if the data is inclusive or exclusive of endpoints. 316 Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Example 5.2 The data in Table 5.1 are 55 smiling times, in seconds, of an eight-week-old baby. 10.4 19.6 18.8 13.9 17.8 16.8 21.6 17.9 12.5 11.1 4.9 12.8 14.8 22.8 20.0 15.9 16.3 13.4 17.1 14.5 19.0 22.8 1.3 0.7 8.9 11.9 10.9 7.3 5.9 3.7 17.9 19.2 9.8 5.8 6.9 2.6 5.8 21.7 11.8 3.4 2.1 4.5 6.3 10.7 8.9 9.4 9.4 7.6 10.0 3.3 6.7 7.8 11.6 13.8 18.6 Table 5.1 The sample mean = 11.49 and the sample standard deviation = 6.23. We will assume that the smiling times, in seconds, follow a uniform distribution between zero and 23 seconds, inclusive. This means that any smiling time from zero to and including 23 seconds is equally likely. The histogram that could be constructed from the sample is an empirical distribution that closely matches the theoretical uniform distribution. Let X = length, in seconds, of an eight-week-old baby's smile. The notation for the uniform distribution is X ~ U(a, b) where a = the lowest value of x and b = the highest value of x. The probability density function is f(x) = 1 b −a for a ≤ x ≤ b. For this example, X ~ U(0, 23) and f(x) = 1 23 − 0 for 0 ≤ X ≤ 23. Formulas for the theoretical mean and standard deviation are µ =a + b 2 and σ = (b −a) 2 12 For this problem, the theoretical mean and standard deviation are μ = 0 + 23 2 = 11.50 seconds and σ = (23 − 0) 2 12 = 6.64 seconds. Notice that the theoretical mean and standard deviation are close to the sample mean and standard deviation in this example. Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables 317 5.2 The data that follow are the number of passengers on 35 different charter fishing boats. The sample mean = 7.9 and the sample standard deviation = 4.33. The data follow a uniform distribution where all values between and including zero and 14 are equally likely. State the values of a and b. Write the distribution in proper notation, and calculate the theoretical mean and standard deviation. 1 12 4 10 4 14 11 7 11 4 13 2 4 6 3 10 0 12 6 9 10 5 13 4 10 14 12 11 6 10 11 0 11 13 2 Table 5.2 Example 5.3 a.

Find the probability that a random eight-week-old baby smiles more than 12 seconds KNOWING that the baby smiles MORE THAN EIGHT SECONDS. Solution 5.3 c. This probability question is a conditional. You are asked to find the probability that an eight-week-old baby smiles more than 12 seconds when you already know the baby has smiled for more than eight seconds. Find P(x > 12|x > 8) There are two ways to do the problem. For the first way, use the fact that this is a conditional and changes the sample space. The graph illustrates the new sample space. You already know the baby smiled more than eight seconds. Write a new f(x): f(x) = 1 23 − 8 = 1 15 for 8 < x < 23 P(x > 12|x > 8) = (23 − 12) ⎛ ⎝ 1 15 ⎞ ⎠= 11 15 Figure 5.13 For the second way, use the conditional formula from Probability Topics with the original distribution X ~ U (0, 23): Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables 319 P(A|B) = P(A AND B) P(B) For this problem, A is (x > 12) and B is (x > 8). So, P(x > 12|x > 8) = (x> 12 AND x> 8) P(x> 8) =P(x> 12) P(x> 8) = 11 23 15 23 =11 15 Figure 5.14 5.3 A distribution is given as X ~ U (0, 20). What is P(2 < x < 18)? Find the 90th percentile. Example 5.4 The amount of time, in minutes, that a person must wait for a bus is uniformly distributed between zero and 15 minutes, inclusive. a. What is the probability that a person waits fewer than 12.5 minutes? Solution 5.4 a. Let X = the number of minutes a person must wait for a bus. a = 0 and b = 15. X ~ U(0, 15).

Find the probability that a different nine-year old child eats a donut in more than two minutes given that the child has already been eating the donut for more than 1.5 minutes. The second question has a conditional probability. You are asked to find the probability that a nine-year old child eats a donut in more than two minutes given that the child has already been eating the donut for more than 1.5 minutes. Solve the problem two different ways (see Exercise 5.0). You must reduce the sample space. First way: Since you know the child has already been eating the donut for more than 1.5 minutes, you are no longer starting at a = 0.5 minutes. Your starting point is 1.5 minutes. Write a new f(x): f(x) = 1 4 − 1.5 = 2 5for 1.5 ≤ x ≤ 4. Find P(x > 2|x > 1.5).

Use the conditional formula P(x > 2|x > 1.5) = P(x> 2 AND x> 1.5) P(x> 1.5) = P(x> 2) P(x> 1.5) = 2 3.5 2.5 3.5 = 0.8 =4 5 5.5 Suppose the time it takes a student to finish a quiz is uniformly distributed between six and 15 minutes, inclusive. Let X = the time, in minutes, it takes a student to finish a quiz. Then X ~ U (6, 15). Find the probability that a randomly selected student needs at least eight minutes to complete the quiz. Then find the probability that a different student needs at least eight minutes to finish the quiz given that she has already taken more than seven minutes. Example 5.6 Ace Heating and Air Conditioning Service finds that the amount of time a repairman needs to fix a furnace is uniformly distributed between 1.5 and four hours.

To find f(x): f (x) = 1 4 − 1.5 = 1 2.5 so f(x) = 0.4 P(x > 2) = (base)(height) = (4 – 2)(0.4) = 0.8 Figure 5.18 Uniform Distribution between 1.5 and four with shaded area between two and four representing the probability that the repair time x is greater than two Solution 5.6 b. P(x < 3) = (base)(height) = (3 – 1.5)(0.4) = 0.6 The graph of the rectangle showing the entire distribution would remain the same. However the graph should be shaded between x = 1.5 and x = 3. Note that the shaded area starts at x = 1.5 rather than at x = 0; since X ~ U (1.5, 4), x can not be less than 1.5.

Solution 5.6 d. Figure 5.21 Uniform Distribution between 1.5 and 4 with an area of 0.25 shaded to the right representing the longest 25% of repair times. P(x > k) = 0.25 P(x > k) = (base)(height) = (4 – k)(0.4) 0.25 = (4 – k)(0.4); Solve for k: 0.625 = 4 − k, obtained by dividing both sides by 0.4 −3.375 = −k, obtained by subtracting four from both sides: k = 3.375 The longest 25% of furnace repairs take at least 3.375 hours (3.375 hours or longer). Note: Since 25% of repair times are 3.375 hours or longer, that means that 75% of repair times are 3.375 hours or less. 3.375 hours is the 75th percentile of furnace repair times.

Find the 50th percentile. 5.3 | The Exponential Distribution The exponential distribution is often concerned with the amount of time until some specific event occurs. For example, the amount of time (beginning now) until an earthquake occurs has an exponential distribution. Other examples include the length, in minutes, of long distance business telephone calls, and the amount of time, in months, a car battery lasts. It can be shown, too, that the value of the change that you have in your pocket or purse approximately follows an exponential distribution. Values for an exponential random variable occur in the following way. There are fewer large values and more small values. For example, the amount of money customers spend in one trip to the supermarket follows an exponential distribution. There are more people who spend small amounts of money and fewer people who spend large amounts of money. Exponential distributions are commonly used in calculations of product reliability, or the length of time a product lasts. Example 5.7 Let X = amount of time (in minutes) a postal clerk spends with his or her customer. The time is known to have an exponential distribution with the average amount of time equal to four minutes. X is a continuous random variable since time is measured. It is given that μ = 4 minutes. To do any calculations, you must know m, the decay parameter. m =1 µ . Therefore, m =1 4 = 0.25. The standard deviation, σ, is the same as the mean. μ = σ The distribution notation is X ~ Exp(m). Therefore, X ~ Exp(0.25). The probability density function is f(x) = me-mx. The number e = 2.71828182846... It is a number that is used often in mathematics. Scientific calculators have the key \"ex.\" If you enter one for x, the calculator will display the value e. The curve is: f(x) = 0.25e–0.25x where x is at least zero and m = 0.25. For example, f(5) = 0.25e(-0.25)(5) = 0.072. The probability that the postal clerk spends five minutes with the 326 Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 customers is 0.072. The graph is as follows: Figure 5.22 Notice the graph is a declining curve. When x = 0, f(x) = 0.25e(−0.25)(0) = (0.25)(1) = 0.25 = m. The maximum value on the y-axis is m. 5.7 The amount of time spouses shop for anniversary cards can be modeled by an exponential distribution with the average amount of time equal to eight minutes. Write the distribution, state the probability density function, and graph the distribution. Example 5.8 a. Using the information in Example 5.7, find the probability that a clerk spends four to five minutes with a randomly selected customer. Solution 5.8 a. Find P(4 < x < 5). The cumulative distribution function (CDF) gives the area to the left. P(x < x) = 1 – e–mx P(x < 5) = 1 – e(−0.25)(5) = 0.7135 and P(x < 4) = 1 – e(–0.25)(4) = 0.6321 Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables 327 Figure 5.23 NOTE You can do these calculations easily on a calculator. The probability that a postal clerk spends four to five minutes with a randomly selected customer is P(4 < x < 5) = P(x < 5) – P(x < 4) = 0.7135 − 0.6321 = 0.0814.

Find the 50th percentile. Figure 5.24 P(x < k) = 0.50, k = 2.8 minutes (calculator or computer) Half of all customers are finished within 2.8 minutes. You can also do the calculation as follows: 328 Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 P(x < k) = 0.50 and P(x < k) = 1 –e–0.25k Therefore, 0.50 = 1 − e−0.25k and e−0.25k = 1 − 0.50 = 0.5 Take natural logs: ln(e–0.25k) = ln(0.50). So, –0.25k = ln(0.50) Solve for k: k =ln(0.50) -0.25 = 2.8minutes. The calculator simplifies the calculation for percentile k. See the following two notes.

Which is larger, the mean or the median? Solution 5.8 c. From part b, the median or 50 th percentile is 2.8 minutes. The theoretical mean is four minutes. The mean is larger. 5.8 The number of days ahead travelers purchase their airline tickets can be modeled by an exponential distribution with the average amount of time equal to 15 days. Find the probability that a traveler will purchase a ticket fewer than ten days in advance. How many days do half of all travelers wait?

Let X = the amount of money a student in your class has in his or her pocket or purse. The distribution for X is approximately exponential with mean, μ = _______ and m = _______.

Draw the graph. P(x > 7) = 1 – P(x < 7). Since P(X < x) = 1 –e–mx then P(X > x) = 1 –(1 –e–mx) = e-mx P(x > 7) = e(–0.1)(7) = 0.4966.

Example 5.10 Suppose that the length of a phone call, in minutes, is an exponential random variable with decay parameter 1 12 . If another person arrives at a public telephone just before you, find the probability that you will have to wait more than five minutes. Let X = the length of a phone call, in minutes. What is m, μ, and σ? The probability that you must wait more than five minutes is _______ .

Example 5.11 The time spent waiting between events is often modeled using the exponential distribution. For example, suppose that an average of 30 customers per hour arrive at a store and the time between arrivals is exponentially distributed. a. On average, how many minutes elapse between two successive arrivals? b. When the store first opens, how long on average does it take for three customers to arrive? c. After a customer arrives, find the probability that it takes less than one minute for the next customer to arrive. 332 Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 d. After a customer arrives, find the probability that it takes more than five minutes for the next customer to arrive. e. Seventy percent of the customers arrive within how many minutes of the previous customer? f. Is an exponential distribution reasonable for this situation? Solution 5.11 a. Since we expect 30 customers to arrive per hour (60 minutes), we expect on average one customer to arrive every two minutes on average. b. Since one customer arrives every two minutes on average, it will take six minutes on average for three customers to arrive. c. Let X = the time between arrivals, in minutes. By part a, μ = 2, so m = 1 2= 0.5. Therefore, X ∼ Exp(0.5). The cumulative distribution function is P(X < x) = 1 – e(-0.5)(x). Therefore P(X < 1) = 1 – e(–0.5)(1) ≈ 0.3935. 1 - e^(–0.5) ≈ 0.3935 Figure 5.28 d. P(X > 5) = 1 – P(X < 5) = 1 – (1 – e(-0.50)(5)) = e–2.5 ≈ 0.0821. Figure 5.29 Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables 333 1 – (1 – e^((-0.50)(5))) or e^( – 5*0.5) e. We want to solve 0.70 = P(X < x) for x. Substituting in the cumulative distribution function gives 0.70 = 1 – e–0.5x, so that e–0.5x = 0.30. Converting this to logarithmic form gives –0.5x = ln(0.30), or x=ln(0.30) – 0.5 ≈ 2.41minutes. Thus, seventy percent of customers arrive within 2.41 minutes of the previous customer. You are finding the 70th percentile k so you can use the formula k = ln(1 –Area_ To_ The _ Le f t _ O f _ k) ( –m) k = ln(1 – 0.70) ( – 0.5) ≈ 2.41minutes Figure 5.30 f. This model assumes that a single customer arrives at a time, which may not be reasonable since people might shop in groups, leading to several customers arriving at the same time. It also assumes that the flow of customers does not change throughout the day, which is not valid if some times of the day are busier than others. 5.11 Suppose that on a certain stretch of highway, cars pass at an average rate of five cars per minute. Assume that the duration of time between successive cars follows the exponential distribution. a. On average, how many seconds elapse between two successive cars? b. After a car passes by, how long on average will it take for another seven cars to pass by? c. Find the probability that after a car passes by, the next car will pass within the next 20 seconds. d. Find the probability that after a car passes by, the next car will not pass for at least another 15 seconds. Memorylessness of the Exponential Distribution In Example 5.7 recall that the amount of time between customers is exponentially distributed with a mean of two minutes (X ~ Exp (0.5)). Suppose that five minutes have elapsed since the last customer arrived. Since an unusually long amount of time has now elapsed, it would seem to be more likely for a customer to arrive within the next minute. With the exponential 334 Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 distribution, this is not the case–the additional time spent waiting for the next customer does not depend on how much time has already elapsed since the last customer. This is referred to as the memoryless property. Specifically, the memoryless property says that P (X > r + t | X > r) = P (X > t) for all r ≥ 0 and t ≥ 0 For example, if five minutes have elapsed since the last customer arrived, then the probability that more than one minute will elapse before the next customer arrives is computed by using r = 5 and t = 1 in the foregoing equation. P(X > 5 + 1 | X > 5) = P(X > 1) = e(– 0.5)(1) ≈ 0.6065. This is the same probability as that of waiting more than one minute for a customer to arrive after the previous arrival. The exponential distribution is often used to model the longevity of an electrical or mechanical device. In Example 5.9, the lifetime of a certain computer part has the exponential distribution with a mean of ten years (X ~ Exp(0.1)). The memoryless property says that knowledge of what has occurred in the past has no effect on future probabilities. In this case it means that an old part is not any more likely to break down at any particular time than a brand new part. In other words, the part stays as good as new until it suddenly breaks. For example, if the part has already lasted ten years, then the probability that it lasts another seven years is P(X > 17|X > 10) = P(X > 7) = 0.4966. Example 5.12 Refer to Example 5.7 where the time a postal clerk spends with his or her customer has an exponential distribution with a mean of four minutes. Suppose a customer has spent four minutes with a postal clerk. What is the probability that he or she will spend at least an additional three minutes with the postal clerk? The decay parameter of X is m = 1 4= 0.25, so X ∼ Exp(0.25). The cumulative distribution function is P(X < x) = 1 – e–0.25x. We want to find P(X > 7|X > 4). The memoryless property says that P(X > 7|X > 4) = P (X > 3), so we just need to find the probability that a customer spends more than three minutes with a postal clerk. This is P(X > 3) = 1 – P (X < 3) = 1 – (1 – e–0.25⋅3) = e–0.75 ≈ 0.4724. Figure 5.31 1–(1–e^(–0.25*3)) = e^(–0.25*3). Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables 335 5.12 Suppose that the longevity of a light bulb is exponential with a mean lifetime of eight years. If a bulb has already lasted 12 years, find the probability that it will last a total of over 19 years. Relationship between the Poisson and the Exponential Distribution There is an interesting relationship between the exponential distribution and the Poisson distribution. Suppose that the time that elapses between two successive events follows the exponential distribution with a mean of μ units of time. Also assume that these times are independent, meaning that the time between events is not affected by the times between previous events. If these assumptions hold, then the number of events per unit time follows a Poisson distribution with mean λ = 1/μ. Recall from the chapter on Discrete Random Variables that if X has the Poisson distribution with mean λ, then P(X =k) =λk e−λ k ! . Conversely, if the number of events per unit time follows a Poisson distribution, then the amount of time between events follows the exponential distribution. (k! = k*(k–1*)(k–2)*(k–3)…3*2*1) Suppose X has the Poisson distribution with mean λ. Compute P(X = k) by entering 2 nd, VARS(DISTR), C: poissonpdf(λ, k). To compute P(X ≤ k), enter 2nd, VARS (DISTR), D:poissoncdf(λ, k). Example 5.13 At a police station in a large city, calls come in at an average rate of four calls per minute. Assume that the time that elapses from one call to the next has the exponential distribution. Take note that we are concerned only with the rate at which calls come in, and we are ignoring the time spent on the phone. We must also assume that the times spent between calls are independent. This means that a particularly long delay between two calls does not mean that there will be a shorter waiting period for the next call. We may then deduce that the total number of calls received during a time period has the Poisson distribution. a. Find the average time between two successive calls. b. Find the probability that after a call is received, the next call occurs in less than ten seconds. c. Find the probability that exactly five calls occur within a minute. d. Find the probability that less than five calls occur within a minute. e. Find the probability that more than 40 calls occur in an eight-minute period. Solution 5.13 a. On average there are four calls occur per minute, so 15 seconds, or 15 60 = 0.25 minutes occur between successive calls on average. b. Let T = time elapsed between calls. From part a, μ = 0.25, so m = 1 0.25 = 4. Thus, T ∼ Exp(4). The cumulative distribution function is P(T < t) = 1 – e–4t. The probability that the next call occurs in less than ten seconds (ten seconds = 1/6 minute) is P ⎛ ⎝T < 1 6 ⎞ ⎠= 1 –e ⎛ ⎝– 4 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 1 6 ⎞ ⎠ ≈ 0.4866. 336 Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Figure 5.32 c. Let X = the number of calls per minute. As previously stated, the number of calls per minute has a Poisson distribution, with a mean of four calls per minute. Therefore, X ∼ Poisson(4), and so P(X = 5) = 4 5e−4 5 ! ≈ 0.1563. (5! = (5)(4)(3)(2)(1)) poissonpdf(4, 5) = 0.1563. d. Keep in mind that X must be a whole number, so P(X < 5) = P(X ≤ 4). To compute this, we could take P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4). Using technology, we see that P(X ≤ 4) = 0.6288. poisssoncdf(4, 4) = 0.6288 e. Let Y = the number of calls that occur during an eight minute period. Since there is an average of four calls per minute, there is an average of (8)(4) = 32 calls during each eight minute period. Hence, Y ∼ Poisson(32). Therefore, P(Y > 40) = 1 – P (Y ≤ 40) = 1 – 0.9294 = 0.0707. 1 – poissoncdf(32, 40). = 0.0707 5.13 In a small city, the number of automobile accidents occur with a Poisson distribution at an average of three per week. a.

Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables 341 Conditional Probability decay parameter Exponential Distribution memoryless property Poisson distribution Uniform Distribution KEY TERMS the likelihood that an event will occur given that another event has already occurred. The decay parameter describes the rate at which probabilities decay to zero for increasing values of x. It is the value m in the probability density function f(x) = me(-mx) of an exponential random variable. It is also equal to m = 1 µ , where μ is the mean of the random variable. a continuous random variable (RV) that appears when we are interested in the intervals of time between some random events, for example, the length of time between emergency arrivals at a hospital; the notation is X ~ Exp(m). The mean is μ = 1 m and the standard deviation is σ = 1 m . The probability density function is f(x) = me−mx, x ≥ 0 and the cumulative distribution function is P(X ≤ x) = 1 − e−mx. For an exponential random variable X, the memoryless property is the statement that knowledge of what has occurred in the past has no effect on future probabilities. This means that the probability that X exceeds x + k, given that it has exceeded x, is the same as the probability that X would exceed k if we had no knowledge about it. In symbols we say that P(X > x + k|X > x) = P(X > k). If there is a known average of λ events occurring per unit time, and these events are independent of each other, then the number of events X occurring in one unit of time has the Poisson distribution. The probability of k events occurring in one unit time is equal to P(X =k) =λk e−λ k ! . a continuous random variable (RV) that has equally likely outcomes over the domain, a < x < b. Notation: X ~ U(a,b). The mean is μ = a + b 2 and the standard deviation is σ = (b −a) 2 12 . The probability density function is f(x) = 1 b −a for a < x < b or a ≤ x ≤ b. The cumulative distribution is P(X ≤ x) = x−a b −a . CHAPTER REVIEW 5.1 Continuous Probability Functions The probability density function (pdf) is used to describe probabilities for continuous random variables. The area under the density curve between two points corresponds to the probability that the variable falls between those two values. In other words, the area under the density curve between points a and b is equal to P(a < x < b). The cumulative distribution function (cdf) gives the probability as an area. If X is a continuous random variable, the probability density function (pdf), f(x), is used to draw the graph of the probability distribution. The total area under the graph of f(x) is one. The area under the graph of f(x) and between values a and b gives the probability P(a < x < b). Figure 5.35 The cumulative distribution function (cdf) of X is defined by P (X ≤ x). It is a function of x that gives the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to x. 342 Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 5.2 The Uniform Distribution If X has a uniform distribution where a < x < b or a ≤ x ≤ b, then X takes on values between a and b (may include a and b). All values x are equally likely. We write X ∼ U(a, b). The mean of X is µ =a + b 2 . The standard deviation of X is σ = (b −a) 2 12 . The probability density function of X is f (x) = 1 b −a for a ≤ x ≤ b. The cumulative distribution function of X is P(X ≤ x) = x−a b −a . X is continuous. Figure 5.36 The probability P(c < X < d) may be found by computing the area under f(x), between c and d. Since the corresponding area is a rectangle, the area may be found simply by multiplying the width and the height. 5.3 The Exponential Distribution If X has an exponential distribution with mean μ, then the decay parameter is m = 1 µ , and we write X ∼ Exp(m) where x ≥ 0 and m > 0 . The probability density function of X is f(x) = me-mx (or equivalently f (x) =1 µe −x/ µ . The cumulative distribution function of X is P(X ≤ x) = 1 – e–mx. The exponential distribution has the memoryless property, which says that future probabilities do not depend on any past information. Mathematically, it says that P(X > x + k|X > x) = P(X > k). If T represents the waiting time between events, and if T ∼ Exp(λ), then the number of events X per unit time follows the Poisson distribution with mean λ. The probability density function of X is P (X =k) =λk e−k k ! . This may be computed using a TI-83, 83+, 84, 84+ calculator with the command poissonpdf(λ, k). The cumulative distribution function P(X ≤ k) may be computed using the TI-83, 83+,84, 84+ calculator with the command poissoncdf(λ, k).

To do this, P(6 < t < 10) – P(t < 6) = = ⎛ ⎝ ⎜1 –e –1 8 * 10⎞ ⎠ ⎟– ⎛ ⎝ ⎜1 –e –1 8 * 6⎞ ⎠ ⎟≈ 0.7135 – 0.5276 = 0.1859 Figure 5.56 c. We want to find 0.70 =P(T >t) = 1 – ⎛ ⎝ ⎜1 –e−t 8 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟=e−t 8. Solving for t, e –t 8= 0.70, so –t 8= ln(0.70), and t = –8ln(0.70) ≈ 2.85 years. Or use t = ln(area_to_the_right) ( –m) =ln(0.70) –1 8 ≈ 2.85 years. 362 Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Figure 5.57 d. We want to find 0.02 = P(T < t) = 1 – e –t 8. Solving for t, e –t 8= 0.98, so –t 8= ln(0.98), and t = –8ln(0.98) ≈ 0.1616 years, or roughly two months. The warranty should cover light bulbs that last less than 2 months. Or use ln(area_to_the_right) ( – m) =ln(1 – 0.2) –1 8 = 0.1616. e. We must find P(T < 8|T > 7). Notice that by the rule of complement events, P(T < 8|T > 7) = 1 – P(T > 8|T > 7). By the memoryless property (P(X > r + t|X > r) = P(X > t)). So P(T > 8|T > 7) = P(T > 1) = 1 – ⎛ ⎝ ⎜1 –e –1 8 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟=e –1 8≈ 0.8825 Therefore, P(T < 8|T > 7) = 1 – 0.8825 = 0.1175. 97 Let X = the number of no-hitters throughout a season. Since the duration of time between no-hitters is exponential, the number of no-hitters per season is Poisson with mean λ = 3. Therefore, (X = 0) = 3 0e – 3 0! = e–3 ≈ 0.0498 NOTE You could let T = duration of time between no-hitters. Since the time is exponential and there are 3 no-hitters per season, then the time between no-hitters is 1 3season. For the exponential, µ = 1 3 . Therefore, m = 1 µ = 3 and T ∼ Exp(3). a. The desired probability is P(T > 1) = 1 – P(T < 1) = 1 – (1 – e–3) = e–3 ≈ 0.0498. b. Let T = duration of time between no-hitters. We find P(T > 2|T > 1), and by the memoryless property this is simply P(T > 1), which we found to be 0.0498 in part a. c. Let X = the number of no-hitters is a season. Assume that X is Poisson with mean λ = 3. Then P(X > 3) = 1 – P(X ≤ 3) = 0.3528. 99 a. 100 9 = 11.11 Chapter 5 | Continuous Random Variables 363 b. P(X > 10) = 1 – P(X ≤ 10) = 1 – Poissoncdf(11.11, 10) ≈ 0.5532. c. The number of people with Type B blood encountered roughly follows the Poisson distribution, so the number of people X who arrive between successive Type B arrivals is roughly exponential with mean μ = 9 and m = 1 9 . The cumulative distribution function of X is P(X <x)= 1 −e−x 9. Thus hus, P(X > 20) = 1 - P(X ≤ 20) = 1 − ⎛ ⎝ ⎜1 −e−20 9 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟≈ 0.1084. NOTE We could also deduce that each person arriving has a 8/9 chance of not having Type B blood. So the probability that none of the first 20 people arrive have Type B blood is ⎛ ⎝ 8 9 ⎞ ⎠ 20 ≈ 0.0948. (The geometric distribution is more appropriate than the exponential because the number of people between Type B people is discrete instead of continuous.) 101 Let T = duration (in minutes) between successive visits. Since patients arrive at a rate of one patient every seven minutes, μ = 7 and the decay constant is m = 1 7 . The cdf is P(T < t) = 1 −e t 7 a. P(T < 2) = 1 - 1 −e−2 7 ≈ 0.2485. b. P(T > 15) = 1 −P(T < 15)= 1 − ⎛ ⎝ ⎜1 −e−15 7 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟≈e−15 7 ≈ 0.1173. c. P(T > 15|T > 10) = P(T > 5) = 1 − ⎛ ⎝ ⎜1 −e−5 7 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟=e−5 7≈ 0.4895. d. Let X = # of patients arriving during a half-hour period. Then X has the Poisson distribution with a mean of 30 7, X ∼ Poisson ⎛ ⎝ 30 7 ⎞ ⎠.

(credit: Ömer Ünlϋ) Introduction Chapter Objectives By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: • Recognize the normal probability distribution and apply it appropriately. • Recognize the standard normal probability distribution and apply it appropriately. • Compare normal probabilities by converting to the standard normal distribution. The normal, a continuous distribution, is the most important of all the distributions. It is widely used and even more widely abused. Its graph is bell-shaped. You see the bell curve in almost all disciplines. Some of these include psychology, business, economics, the sciences, nursing, and, of course, mathematics. Some of your instructors may use the normal distribution to help determine your grade. Most IQ scores are normally distributed. Often real-estate prices fit a normal distribution. The normal distribution is extremely important, but it cannot be applied to everything in the real world. In this chapter, you will study the normal distribution, the standard normal distribution, and applications associated with Chapter 6 | The Normal Distribution 365 them. The normal distribution has two parameters (two numerical descriptive measures): the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). If X is a quantity to be measured that has a normal distribution with mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ), we designate this by writing Figure 6.2 The probability density function is a rather complicated function. Do not memorize it. It is not necessary. f(x) = 1 σ ⋅ 2 ⋅π ⋅ e −1 2 ⋅ ⎛ ⎝ x−µ σ ⎞ ⎠ 2 The cumulative distribution function is P(X < x). It is calculated either by a calculator or a computer, or it is looked up in a table. Technology has made the tables virtually obsolete. For that reason, as well as the fact that there are various table formats, we are not including table instructions. The curve is symmetric about a vertical line drawn through the mean, μ. In theory, the mean is the same as the median, because the graph is symmetric about μ. As the notation indicates, the normal distribution depends only on the mean and the standard deviation. Since the area under the curve must equal one, a change in the standard deviation, σ, causes a change in the shape of the curve; the curve becomes fatter or skinnier depending on σ. A change in μ causes the graph to shift to the left or right. This means there are an infinite number of normal probability distributions. One of special interest is called the standard normal distribution. Your instructor will record the heights of both men and women in your class, separately. Draw histograms of your data. Then draw a smooth curve through each histogram. Is each curve somewhat bell-shaped? Do you think that if you had recorded 200 data values for men and 200 for women that the curves would look bell-shaped? Calculate the mean for each data set. Write the means on the x-axis of the appropriate graph below the peak. Shade the approximate area that represents the probability that one randomly chosen male is taller than 72 inches. Shade the approximate area that represents the probability that one randomly chosen female is shorter than 60 inches. If the total area under each curve is one, does either probability appear to be more than 0.5? 6.1 | The Standard Normal Distribution The standard normal distribution is a normal distribution of standardized values called z-scores. A z-score is measured in units of the standard deviation. For example, if the mean of a normal distribution is five and the standard deviation is two, the value 11 is three standard deviations above (or to the right of) the mean. The calculation is as follows: x = μ + (z)(σ) = 5 + (3)(2) = 11 366 Chapter 6 | The Normal Distribution This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 The z-score is three. The mean for the standard normal distribution is zero, and the standard deviation is one. The transformation z = x−µ σ produces the distribution Z ~ N(0, 1). The value x in the given equation comes from a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ. Z-Scores If X is a normally distributed random variable and X ~ N(μ, σ), then the z-score is: z =x – µ σ The z-score tells you how many standard deviations the value x is above (to the right of) or below (to the left of) the mean, μ. Values of x that are larger than the mean have positive z-scores, and values of x that are smaller than the mean have negative z-scores. If x equals the mean, then x has a z-score of zero. Example 6.1 Suppose X ~ N(5, 6). This says that X is a normally distributed random variable with mean μ = 5 and standard deviation σ = 6. Suppose x = 17. Then: z =x–µ σ =17 – 5 6 = 2 This means that x = 17 is two standard deviations (2σ) above or to the right of the mean μ = 5. Notice that: 5 + (2)(6) = 17 (The pattern is μ + zσ = x) Now suppose x = 1. Then: z = x–µ σ = 1 – 5 6 = –0.67 (rounded to two decimal places) This means that x = 1 is 0.67 standard deviations (–0.67σ) below or to the left of the mean μ = 5. Notice that: 5 + (–0.67)(6) is approximately equal to one (This has the pattern μ + (–0.67)σ = 1) Summarizing, when z is positive, x is above or to the right of μ and when z is negative, x is to the left of or below μ. Or, when z is positive, x is greater than μ, and when z is negative x is less than μ. 6.1 What is the z-score of x, when x = 1 and X ~ N(12,3)? Example 6.2 Some doctors believe that a person can lose five pounds, on the average, in a month by reducing his or her fat intake and by exercising consistently. Suppose weight loss has a normal distribution. Let X = the amount of weight lost (in pounds) by a person in a month. Use a standard deviation of two pounds. X ~ N(5, 2). Fill in the blanks. a. Suppose a person lost ten pounds in a month. The z-score when x = 10 pounds is z = 2.5 (verify). This z-score tells you that x = 10 is ________ standard deviations to the ________ (right or left) of the mean _____ (What is the mean?). Solution 6.2 a. This z-score tells you that x = 10 is 2.5 standard deviations to the right of the mean five. b. Suppose a person gained three pounds (a negative weight loss). Then z = __________. This z-score tells you Chapter 6 | The Normal Distribution 367 that x = –3 is ________ standard deviations to the __________ (right or left) of the mean. Solution 6.2 b. z = –4. This z-score tells you that x = –3 is four standard deviations to the left of the mean. c. Suppose the random variables X and Y have the following normal distributions: X ~ N(5, 6) and Y ~ N(2, 1). If x = 17, then z = 2. (This was previously shown.) If y = 4, what is z? Solution 6.2 c. z = y−µ σ = 4 − 2 1 = 2 where µ = 2 and σ = 1. The z-score for y = 4 is z = 2. This means that four is z = 2 standard deviations to the right of the mean. Therefore, x = 17 and y = 4 are both two (of their own) standard deviations to the right of their respective means. The z-score allows us to compare data that are scaled differently. To understand the concept, suppose X ~ N(5, 6) represents weight gains for one group of people who are trying to gain weight in a six week period and Y ~ N(2, 1) measures the same weight gain for a second group of people. A negative weight gain would be a weight loss. Since x = 17 and y = 4 are each two standard deviations to the right of their means, they represent the same, standardized weight gain relative to their means. 6.2 Fill in the blanks. Jerome averages 16 points a game with a standard deviation of four points. X ~ N(16,4). Suppose Jerome scores ten points in a game. The z–score when x = 10 is –1.5. This score tells you that x = 10 is _____ standard deviations to the ______(right or left) of the mean______(What is the mean?). The Empirical Rule If X is a random variable and has a normal distribution with mean µ and standard deviation σ, then the Empirical Rule states the following: • About 68% of the x values lie between –1σ and +1σ of the mean µ (within one standard deviation of the mean). • About 95% of the x values lie between –2σ and +2σ of the mean µ (within two standard deviations of the mean). • About 99.7% of the x values lie between –3σ and +3σ of the mean µ (within three standard deviations of the mean). Notice that almost all the x values lie within three standard deviations of the mean. • The z-scores for +1σ and –1σ are +1 and –1, respectively. • The z-scores for +2σ and –2σ are +2 and –2, respectively. • The z-scores for +3σ and –3σ are +3 and –3 respectively. The empirical rule is also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule. 368 Chapter 6 | The Normal Distribution This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Figure 6.3 Example 6.3 The mean height of 15 to 18-year-old males from Chile from 2009 to 2010 was 170 cm with a standard deviation of 6.28 cm. Male heights are known to follow a normal distribution. Let X = the height of a 15 to 18-year-old male from Chile in 2009 to 2010. Then X ~ N(170, 6.28). a. Suppose a 15 to 18-year-old male from Chile was 168 cm tall from 2009 to 2010. The z-score when x = 168 cm is z = _______.

Suppose that the height of a 15 to 18-year-old male from Chile from 2009 to 2010 has a z-score of z = 1.27. What is the male’s height? The z-score (z = 1.27) tells you that the male’s height is ________ standard deviations to the __________ (right or left) of the mean. Solution 6.3 b. 177.98 cm, 1.27, right 6.3 Use the information in Example 6.3 to answer the following questions. a. Suppose a 15 to 18-year-old male from Chile was 176 cm tall from 2009 to 2010. The z-score when x = 176 cm is z = _______. This z-score tells you that x = 176 cm is ________ standard deviations to the ________ (right or left) of the mean _____ (What is the mean?). b. Suppose that the height of a 15 to 18-year-old male from Chile from 2009 to 2010 has a z-score of z = –2. What is the male’s height? The z-score (z = –2) tells you that the male’s height is ________ standard deviations to the __________ (right or left) of the mean. Example 6.4 From 1984 to 1985, the mean height of 15 to 18-year-old males from Chile was 172.36 cm, and the standard deviation was 6.34 cm. Let Y = the height of 15 to 18-year-old males from 1984 to 1985. Then Y ~ N(172.36, 6.34). Chapter 6 | The Normal Distribution 369 The mean height of 15 to 18-year-old males from Chile from 2009 to 2010 was 170 cm with a standard deviation of 6.28 cm. Male heights are known to follow a normal distribution. Let X = the height of a 15 to 18-year-old male from Chile in 2009 to 2010. Then X ~ N(170, 6.28). Find the z-scores for x = 160.58 cm and y = 162.85 cm. Interpret each z-score. What can you say about x = 160.58 cm and y = 162.85 cm as they compare to their respective means and standard deviations? Solution 6.4 The z-score for x = -160.58 is z = –1.5. The z-score for y = 162.85 is z = –1.5. Both x = 160.58 and y = 162.85 deviate the same number of standard deviations from their respective means and in the same direction. 6.4 In 2012, 1,664,479 students took the SAT exam. The distribution of scores in the verbal section of the SAT had a mean µ = 496 and a standard deviation σ = 114. Let X = a SAT exam verbal section score in 2012. Then X ~ N(496, 114). Find the z-scores for x1 = 325 and x2 = 366.21. Interpret each z-score. What can you say about x1 = 325 and x2 = 366.21 as they compare to their respective means and standard deviations? Example 6.5 Suppose x has a normal distribution with mean 50 and standard deviation 6. • About 68% of the x values lie within one standard deviation of the mean. Therefore, about 68% of the x values lie between –1σ = (–1)(6) = –6 and 1σ = (1)(6) = 6 of the mean 50. The values 50 – 6 = 44 and 50 + 6 = 56 are within one standard deviation from the mean 50. The z-scores are –1 and +1 for 44 and 56, respectively. • About 95% of the x values lie within two standard deviations of the mean. Therefore, about 95% of the x values lie between –2σ = (–2)(6) = –12 and 2σ = (2)(6) = 12. The values 50 – 12 = 38 and 50 + 12 = 62 are within two standard deviations from the mean 50. The z-scores are –2 and +2 for 38 and 62, respectively. • About 99.7% of the x values lie within three standard deviations of the mean. Therefore, about 95% of the x values lie between –3σ = (–3)(6) = –18 and 3σ = (3)(6) = 18 from the mean 50. The values 50 – 18 = 32 and 50 + 18 = 68 are within three standard deviations of the mean 50. The z-scores are –3 and +3 for 32 and 68, respectively. 6.5 Suppose X has a normal distribution with mean 25 and standard deviation five. Between what values of x do 68% of the values lie? Example 6.6 From 1984 to 1985, the mean height of 15 to 18-year-old males from Chile was 172.36 cm, and the standard deviation was 6.34 cm. Let Y = the height of 15 to 18-year-old males in 1984 to 1985. Then Y ~ N(172.36, 6.34). a. About 68% of the y values lie between what two values? These values are ________________.

These values are ________________. The z-scores are ________________, respectively. Solution 6.6 a. About 68% of the values lie between 166.02 cm and 178.7 cm. The z-scores are –1 and 1. b. About 95% of the values lie between 159.68 cm and 185.04 cm. The z-scores are –2 and 2. c. About 99.7% of the values lie between 153.34 cm and 191.38 cm. The z-scores are –3 and 3. 6.6 The scores on a college entrance exam have an approximate normal distribution with mean, µ = 52 points and a standard deviation, σ = 11 points. a.

The z-scores are ________________, respectively. 6.2 | Using the Normal Distribution The shaded area in the following graph indicates the area to the left of x. This area is represented by the probability P(X < x). Normal tables, computers, and calculators provide or calculate the probability P(X < x). Figure 6.4 The area to the right is then P(X > x) = 1 – P(X < x). Remember, P(X < x) = Area to the left of the vertical line through x. P(X < x) = 1 – P(X < x) = Area to the right of the vertical line through x. P(X < x) is the same as P(X ≤ x) and P(X > x) is the same as P(X ≥ x) for continuous distributions. Calculations of Probabilities Probabilities are calculated using technology. There are instructions given as necessary for the TI-83+ and TI-84 calculators. Chapter 6 | The Normal Distribution 371 NOTE To calculate the probability, use the probability tables provided in Appendix H without the use of technology. The tables include instructions for how to use them. Example 6.7 If the area to the left is 0.0228, then the area to the right is 1 – 0.0228 = 0.9772. 6.7 If the area to the left of x is 0.012, then what is the area to the right? Example 6.8 The final exam scores in a statistics class were normally distributed with a mean of 63 and a standard deviation of five. a. Find the probability that a randomly selected student scored more than 65 on the exam. Solution 6.8 a. Let X = a score on the final exam. X ~ N(63, 5), where μ = 63 and σ = 5. Draw a graph. Then, find P(x > 65). P(x > 65) = 0.3446 Figure 6.5 The probability that any student selected at random scores more than 65 is 0.3446. Go into 2nd DISTR. 372 Chapter 6 | The Normal Distribution This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 After pressing 2nd DISTR, press 2:normalcdf. The syntax for the instructions are as follows: normalcdf(lower value, upper value, mean, standard deviation) For this problem: normalcdf(65,1E99,63,5) = 0.3446. You get 1E99 (= 1099) by pressing 1, the EE key (a 2nd key) and then 99. Or, you can enter 10^99 instead. The number 10 99 is way out in the right tail of the normal curve. We are calculating the area between 65 and 10 99. In some instances, the lower number of the area might be –1E99 (= –10 99). The number –10 99 is way out in the left tail of the normal curve. HISTORICAL NOTE The TI probability program calculates a z-score and then the probability from the z-score. Before technology, the z-score was looked up in a standard normal probability table (because the math involved is too cumbersome) to find the probability. In this example, a standard normal table with area to the left of the z-score was used. You calculate the z-score and look up the area to the left. The probability is the area to the right. z = 65 – 63 5 = 0.4 Area to the left is 0.6554. P(x > 65) = P(z > 0.4) = 1 – 0.6554 = 0.3446 Find the percentile for a student scoring 65: *Press 2nd Distr *Press 2:normalcdf( *Enter lower bound, upper bound, mean, standard deviation followed by ) *Press ENTER. For this Example, the steps are 2nd Distr 2:normalcdf(65,1,2nd EE,99,63,5) ENTER The probability that a selected student scored more than 65 is 0.3446. b. Find the probability that a randomly selected student scored less than 85. Solution 6.8 b. Draw a graph. Then find P(x < 85), and shade the graph. Using a computer or calculator, find P(x < 85) = 1. normalcdf(0,85,63,5) = 1 (rounds to one) The probability that one student scores less than 85 is approximately one (or 100%). c. Find the 90 th percentile (that is, find the score k that has 90% of the scores below k and 10% of the scores above k). Chapter 6 | The Normal Distribution 373 Solution 6.8 c. Find the 90th percentile. For each problem or part of a problem, draw a new graph. Draw the x-axis. Shade the area that corresponds to the 90th percentile. Let k = the 90 th percentile. The variable k is located on the x-axis. P(x < k) is the area to the left of k. The 90th percentile k separates the exam scores into those that are the same or lower than k and those that are the same or higher. Ninety percent of the test scores are the same or lower than k, and ten percent are the same or higher. The variable k is often called a critical value. k = 69.4 Figure 6.6 The 90th percentile is 69.4. This means that 90% of the test scores fall at or below 69.4 and 10% fall at or above. To get this answer on the calculator, follow this step: invNorm in 2nd DISTR. invNorm(area to the left, mean, standard deviation) For this problem, invNorm(0.90,63,5) = 69.4 d. Find the 70 th percentile (that is, find the score k such that 70% of scores are below k and 30% of the scores are above k). Solution 6.8 d. Find the 70th percentile. Draw a new graph and label it appropriately. k = 65.6 The 70th percentile is 65.6. This means that 70% of the test scores fall at or below 65.5 and 30% fall at or above. invNorm(0.70,63,5) = 65.6 6.8 The golf scores for a school team were normally distributed with a mean of 68 and a standard deviation of three.

Let X = the amount of time (in hours) a household personal computer is used for entertainment. X ~ N(2, 0.5) where μ = 2 and σ = 0.5. Find P(1.8 < x < 2.75). The probability for which you are looking is the area between x = 1.8 and x = 2.75. P(1.8 < x < 2.75) = 0.5886 Figure 6.7 normalcdf(1.8,2.75,2,0.5) = 0.5886 The probability that a household personal computer is used between 1.8 and 2.75 hours per day for entertainment is 0.5886. b. Find the maximum number of hours per day that the bottom quartile of households uses a personal computer for entertainment. Solution 6.9 b. To find the maximum number of hours per day that the bottom quartile of households uses a personal computer for entertainment, find the 25th percentile, k, where P(x < k) = 0.25. Chapter 6 | The Normal Distribution 375 Figure 6.8 invNorm(0.25,2,0.5) = 1.66 The maximum number of hours per day that the bottom quartile of households uses a personal computer for entertainment is 1.66 hours. 6.9 The golf scores for a school team were normally distributed with a mean of 68 and a standard deviation of three.

Chapter 6 | The Normal Distribution 383 Normal Distribution Standard Normal Distribution z-score KEY TERMS a continuous random variable (RV) with pdf f(x) = 1 σ 2π e – (x – µ ) 2σ 2 2 , where μ is the mean of the distribution and σ is the standard deviation; notation: X ~ N(μ, σ). If μ = 0 and σ = 1, the RV is called the standard normal distribution. a continuous random variable (RV) X ~ N(0, 1); when X follows the standard normal distribution, it is often noted as Z ~ N(0, 1). the linear transformation of the form z = x – µ σ ; if this transformation is applied to any normal distribution X ~ N(μ, σ) the result is the standard normal distribution Z ~ N(0,1). If this transformation is applied to any specific value x of the RV with mean μ and standard deviation σ, the result is called the z-score of x. The z-score allows us to compare data that are normally distributed but scaled differently. CHAPTER REVIEW 6.1 The Standard Normal Distribution A z-score is a standardized value. Its distribution is the standard normal, Z ~ N(0, 1). The mean of the z-scores is zero and the standard deviation is one. If z is the z-score for a value x from the normal distribution N(µ, σ) then z tells you how many standard deviations x is above (greater than) or below (less than) µ. 6.2 Using the Normal Distribution The normal distribution, which is continuous, is the most important of all the probability distributions. Its graph is bell- shaped. This bell-shaped curve is used in almost all disciplines. Since it is a continuous distribution, the total area under the curve is one. The parameters of the normal are the mean µ and the standard deviation σ. A special normal distribution, called the standard normal distribution is the distribution of z-scores. Its mean is zero, and its standard deviation is one.

(credit: John Lodder) Introduction Chapter Objectives By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: • Recognize central limit theorem problems. • Classify continuous word problems by their distributions. • Apply and interpret the central limit theorem for means. • Apply and interpret the central limit theorem for sums. Why are we so concerned with means? Two reasons are: they give us a middle ground for comparison, and they are easy to calculate. In this chapter, you will study means and the central limit theorem. The central limit theorem (clt for short) is one of the most powerful and useful ideas in all of statistics. There are two alternative forms of the theorem, and both alternatives are concerned with drawing finite samples size n from a population Chapter 7 | The Central Limit Theorem 399 with a known mean, μ, and a known standard deviation, σ. The first alternative says that if we collect samples of size n with a \"large enough n,\" calculate each sample's mean, and create a histogram of those means, then the resulting histogram will tend to have an approximate normal bell shape. The second alternative says that if we again collect samples of size n that are \"large enough,\" calculate the sum of each sample and create a histogram, then the resulting histogram will again tend to have a normal bell-shape. The size of the sample, n, that is required in order to be \"large enough\" depends on the original population from which the samples are drawn (the sample size should be at least 30 or the data should come from a normal distribution). If the original population is far from normal, then more observations are needed for the sample means or sums to be normal. Sampling is done with replacement. It would be difficult to overstate the importance of the central limit theorem in statistical theory. Knowing that data, even if its distribution is not normal, behaves in a predictable way is a powerful tool. Suppose eight of you roll one fair die ten times, seven of you roll two fair dice ten times, nine of you roll five fair dice ten times, and 11 of you roll ten fair dice ten times. Each time a person rolls more than one die, he or she calculates the sample mean of the faces showing. For example, one person might roll five fair dice and get 2, 2, 3, 4, 6 on one roll. The mean is 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 5 = 3.4. The 3.4 is one mean when five fair dice are rolled. This same person would roll the five dice nine more times and calculate nine more means for a total of ten means. Your instructor will pass out the dice to several people. Roll your dice ten times. For each roll, record the faces, and find the mean. Round to the nearest 0.5. Your instructor (and possibly you) will produce one graph (it might be a histogram) for one die, one graph for two dice, one graph for five dice, and one graph for ten dice. Since the \"mean\" when you roll one die is just the face on the die, what distribution do these means appear to be representing? Draw the graph for the means using two dice. Do the sample means show any kind of pattern? Draw the graph for the means using five dice. Do you see any pattern emerging? Finally, draw the graph for the means using ten dice. Do you see any pattern to the graph? What can you conclude as you increase the number of dice? As the number of dice rolled increases from one to two to five to ten, the following is happening: 1. The mean of the sample means remains approximately the same. 2. The spread of the sample means (the standard deviation of the sample means) gets smaller. 3. The graph appears steeper and thinner. You have just demonstrated the central limit theorem (clt). The central limit theorem tells you that as you increase the number of dice, the sample means tend toward a normal distribution (the sampling distribution). 7.1 | The Central Limit Theorem for Sample Means (Averages) Suppose X is a random variable with a distribution that may be known or unknown (it can be any distribution). Using a subscript that matches the random variable, suppose: a. μX = the mean of X b. σX = the standard deviation of X If you draw random samples of size n, then as n increases, the random variable X ¯ which consists of sample means, tends 400 Chapter 7 | The Central Limit Theorem This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 to be normally distributed and X ¯ ~ N ⎛ ⎝µ x, σx n ⎞ ⎠. The central limit theorem for sample means says that if you keep drawing larger and larger samples (such as rolling one, two, five, and finally, ten dice) and calculating their means, the sample means form their own normal distribution (the sampling distribution). The normal distribution has the same mean as the original distribution and a variance that equals the original variance divided by the sample size. Standard deviation is the square root of variance, so the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is the standard deviation of the original distribution divided by the square root of n. The variable n is the number of values that are averaged together, not the number of times the experiment is done. To put it more formally, if you draw random samples of size n, the distribution of the random variable X ¯ , which consists of sample means, is called the sampling distribution of the mean. The sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution as n, the sample size, increases. The random variable X ¯ has a different z-score associated with it from that of the random variable X. The mean x¯ is the value of X ¯ in one sample. z = x¯ −µ x ⎛ ⎝ σ x n ⎞ ⎠ μX is the average of both X and X ¯ . σ x¯ = σx n= standard deviation of X ¯ and is called the standard error of the mean. To find probabilities for means on the calculator, follow these steps. 2nd DISTR 2:normalcdf normalcd f ⎛ ⎝ lower value o f the area, upper value o f the area, mean, standard deviation sample size ⎞ ⎠ where: • mean is the mean of the original distribution • standard deviation is the standard deviation of the original distribution • sample size = n Example 7.1 An unknown distribution has a mean of 90 and a standard deviation of 15. Samples of size n = 25 are drawn randomly from the population. a. Find the probability that the sample mean is between 85 and 92. Solution 7.1 a. Let X = one value from the original unknown population. The probability question asks you to find a probability for the sample mean. Let X ¯ = the mean of a sample of size 25. Since μX = 90, σX = 15, and n = 25, Chapter 7 | The Central Limit Theorem 401 X ¯ ~ N ⎛ ⎝90, 15 25 ⎞ ⎠. Find P(85 < x¯ < 92). Draw a graph.

Figure 7.2 normalcdf(lower value, upper value, mean, standard error of the mean) The parameter list is abbreviated (lower value, upper value, μ, σ n ) normalcdf(85,92,90, 15 25 ) = 0.6997 b. Find the value that is two standard deviations above the expected value, 90, of the sample mean. Solution 7.1 b. To find the value that is two standard deviations above the expected value 90, use the formula: value = μx + (#ofTSDEVs) ⎛ ⎝ σ x n ⎞ ⎠ value = 90 + 2 ⎛ ⎝ 15 25 ⎞ ⎠= 96 The value that is two standard deviations above the expected value is 96. The standard error of the mean is σx n= 15 25 = 3. Recall that the standard error of the mean is a description of how far (on average) that the sample mean will be from the population mean in repeated simple random samples of size n. 402 Chapter 7 | The Central Limit Theorem This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 7.1 An unknown distribution has a mean of 45 and a standard deviation of eight.

A sample of size n = 50 is drawn randomly from the population. Find the probability that the sample mean is between 1.8 hours and 2.3 hours. Solution 7.2 Let X = the time, in hours, it takes to play one soccer match. The probability question asks you to find a probability for the sample mean time, in hours, it takes to play one soccer match. Let X ¯ = the mean time, in hours, it takes to play one soccer match. If μX = _________, σX = __________, and n = ___________, then X ~ N(______, ______) by the central limit theorem for means. μX = 2, σX = 0.5, n = 50, and X ~ N ⎛ ⎝2, 0.5 50 ⎞ ⎠ Find P(1.8 < x¯ < 2.3).

Find the 95th percentile for the sample mean age (to one decimal place). Solution 7.3 a. Since the sample mean tends to target the population mean, we have μχ = μ = 34. The sample standard deviation is given by σχ = σ n= 15 100 = 15 10 = 1.5 b. The central limit theorem states that for large sample sizes(n), the sampling distribution will be approximately normal. c. The probability that the sample mean age is more than 30 is given by P(Χ > 30) = normalcdf(30,E99,34,1.5) = 0.9962 d.

You are researching a startup game targeted at the 35-year-old demographic. Your idea is to develop a strategy game that can be played by men from their late 20s through their late 30s. Based on the article’s data, industry research shows that the average strategy player is 28 years old with a standard deviation of 4.8 years. You take a sample of 100 randomly selected gamers. If your target market is 29- to 35-year-olds, should you continue with your development strategy? Example 7.4 The mean number of minutes for app engagement by a tablet user is 8.2 minutes.

The amounts in a sample are measured and the statistics are n = 34, x¯ = 16.01 ounces. If the cans are filled so that μ = 16.00 ounces (as labeled) and σ = 0.143 ounces, find the probability that a sample of 34 cans will have an average amount greater than 16.01 ounces. Do the results suggest that cans are filled with an amount greater than 16 ounces? 7.2 | The Central Limit Theorem for Sums Suppose X is a random variable with a distribution that may be known or unknown (it can be any distribution) and suppose: a. μX = the mean of Χ b. σΧ = the standard deviation of X If you draw random samples of size n, then as n increases, the random variable ΣX consisting of sums tends to be normally distributed and ΣΧ ~ N((n)(μΧ), ( n)(σΧ)). The central limit theorem for sums says that if you keep drawing larger and larger samples and taking their sums, the sums form their own normal distribution (the sampling distribution), which approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases. The normal distribution has a mean equal to the original mean multiplied by the sample size and a standard deviation equal to the original standard deviation multiplied by the square root of the sample size. The random variable ΣX has the following z-score associated with it: a. Σx is one sum. b. z = Σx– (n)(µ X) (n)(σ X) i. (n)(μX) = the mean of ΣX ii. (n)(σ X)= standard deviation of ΣX To find probabilities for sums on the calculator, follow these steps. 2nd DISTR 2:normalcdf normalcdf(lower value of the area, upper value of the area, (n)(mean), ( n)(standard deviation)) Chapter 7 | The Central Limit Theorem 405 where: • mean is the mean of the original distribution • standard deviation is the standard deviation of the original distribution • sample size = n Example 7.5 An unknown distribution has a mean of 90 and a standard deviation of 15.

The probability question asks you to find a probability for the sum (or total of) 80 values. ΣX = the sum or total of 80 values. Since μX = 90, σX = 15, and n = 80, ΣX ~ N((80)(90), ( 80)(15)) • mean of the sums = (n)(μX) = (80)(90) = 7,200 • standard deviation of the sums = (n)(σ X ) = ( 80)(15) • sum of 80 values = Σx = 7,500 a.

If you are being asked to find the probability of the mean, use the clt for the mean. If you are being asked to find the probability of a sum or total, use the clt for sums. This also applies to percentiles for means and sums. NOTE If you are being asked to find the probability of an individual value, do not use the clt. Use the distribution of its random variable. 408 Chapter 7 | The Central Limit Theorem This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Examples of the Central Limit Theorem Law of Large Numbers The law of large numbers says that if you take samples of larger and larger size from any population, then the mean x¯ of the sample tends to get closer and closer to μ. From the central limit theorem, we know that as n gets larger and larger, the sample means follow a normal distribution. The larger n gets, the smaller the standard deviation gets. (Remember that the standard deviation for X ¯ is σ n .) This means that the sample mean x¯ must be close to the population mean μ. We can say that μ is the value that the sample means approach as n gets larger. The central limit theorem illustrates the law of large numbers. Central Limit Theorem for the Mean and Sum Examples Example 7.8 A study involving stress is conducted among the students on a college campus. The stress scores follow a uniform distribution with the lowest stress score equal to one and the highest equal to five. Using a sample of 75 students, find: a.

Therefore 1. 50th percentile = μΣx = n(μx) = 100(2) = 200 2. 25th percentile = invNorm(0.25,200,5) = 196.63 3. 75th percentile = invNorm(0.75,200,5) = 203.37 c. P(1.75 < x¯ < 1.85) = normalcdf(1.75,1.85,2,0.05) = 0.0013 d. Using the z-score equation, z = x¯ –µ x¯ σ x¯ , and solving for x, we have x = 2(0.05) + 2 = 2.1 e. The IQR is 75th percentile – 25th percentile = 203.37 – 196.63 = 6.74 414 Chapter 7 | The Central Limit Theorem This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 7.10 Based on data from the National Health Survey, women between the ages of 18 and 24 have an average systolic blood pressures (in mm Hg) of 114.8 with a standard deviation of 13.1. Systolic blood pressure for women between the ages of 18 to 24 follow a normal distribution. a. If one woman from this population is randomly selected, find the probability that her systolic blood pressure is greater than 120. b. If 40 women from this population are randomly selected, find the probability that their mean systolic blood pressure is greater than 120. c. If the sample were four women between the ages of 18 to 24 and we did not know the original distribution, could the central limit theorem be used? Example 7.11 A study was done about violence against prostitutes and the symptoms of the posttraumatic stress that they developed. The age range of the prostitutes was 14 to 61. The mean age was 30.9 years with a standard deviation of nine years. a. In a sample of 25 prostitutes, what is the probability that the mean age of the prostitutes is less than 35? b. Is it likely that the mean age of the sample group could be more than 50 years? Interpret the results. c. In a sample of 49 prostitutes, what is the probability that the sum of the ages is no less than 1,600? d. Is it likely that the sum of the ages of the 49 prostitutes is at most 1,595? Interpret the results. e. Find the 95th percentile for the sample mean age of 65 prostitutes. Interpret the results. f. Find the 90th percentile for the sum of the ages of 65 prostitutes. Interpret the results. Solution 7.11 a. P( x¯ < 35) = normalcdf(-E99,35,30.9,1.8) = 0.9886 b. P( x¯ > 50) = normalcdf(50, E99,30.9,1.8) ≈ 0. For this sample group, it is almost impossible for the group’s average age to be more than 50. However, it is still possible for an individual in this group to have an age greater than 50. c. P(Σx ≥ 1,600) = normalcdf(1600,E99,1514.10,63) = 0.0864 d. P(Σx ≤ 1,595) = normalcdf(-E99,1595,1514.10,63) = 0.9005. This means that there is a 90% chance that the sum of the ages for the sample group n = 49 is at most 1595. e. The 95th percentile = invNorm(0.95,30.9,1.1) = 32.7. This indicates that 95% of the prostitutes in the sample of 65 are younger than 32.7 years, on average. f. The 90th percentile = invNorm(0.90,2008.5,72.56) = 2101.5. This indicates that 90% of the prostitutes in the sample of 65 have a sum of ages less than 2,101.5 years. 7.11 According to Boeing data, the 757 airliner carries 200 passengers and has doors with a height of 72 inches. Assume for a certain population of men we have a mean height of 69.0 inches and a standard deviation of 2.8 inches. a. What doorway height would allow 95% of men to enter the aircraft without bending? b. Assume that half of the 200 passengers are men. What mean doorway height satisfies the condition that there is a 0.95 probability that this height is greater than the mean height of 100 men? Chapter 7 | The Central Limit Theorem 415 c. For engineers designing the 757, which result is more relevant: the height from part a or part b? Why? HISTORICAL NOTE : Normal Approximation to the Binomial Historically, being able to compute binomial probabilities was one of the most important applications of the central limit theorem. Binomial probabilities with a small value for n(say, 20) were displayed in a table in a book. To calculate the probabilities with large values of n, you had to use the binomial formula, which could be very complicated. Using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution simplified the process. To compute the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, take a simple random sample from a population. You must meet the conditions for a binomial distribution: • there are a certain number n of independent trials • the outcomes of any trial are success or failure • each trial has the same probability of a success p Recall that if X is the binomial random variable, then X ~ B(n, p). The shape of the binomial distribution needs to be similar to the shape of the normal distribution. To ensure this, the quantities np and nq must both be greater than five (np > 5 and nq > 5; the approximation is better if they are both greater than or equal to 10). Then the binomial can be approximated by the normal distribution with mean μ = np and standard deviation σ = npq. Remember that q = 1 – p. In order to get the best approximation, add 0.5 to x or subtract 0.5 from x (use x + 0.5 or x – 0.5). The number 0.5 is called the continuity correction factor and is used in the following example. Example 7.12 Suppose in a local Kindergarten through 12 th grade (K - 12) school district, 53 percent of the population favor a charter school for grades K through 5. A simple random sample of 300 is surveyed. a. Find the probability that at least 150 favor a charter school. b. Find the probability that at most 160 favor a charter school. c. Find the probability that more than 155 favor a charter school. d. Find the probability that fewer than 147 favor a charter school. e. Find the probability that exactly 175 favor a charter school. Let X = the number that favor a charter school for grades K trough 5. X ~ B(n, p) where n = 300 and p = 0.53. Since np > 5 and nq > 5, use the normal approximation to the binomial. The formulas for the mean and standard deviation are μ = np and σ = npq. The mean is 159 and the standard deviation is 8.6447. The random variable for the normal distribution is Y. Y ~ N(159, 8.6447). See The Normal Distribution for help with calculator instructions. For part a, you include 150 so P(X ≥ 150) has normal approximation P(Y ≥ 149.5) = 0.8641. normalcdf(149.5,10^99,159,8.6447) = 0.8641. For part b, you include 160 so P(X ≤ 160) has normal appraximation P(Y ≤ 160.5) = 0.5689. normalcdf(0,160.5,159,8.6447) = 0.5689 For part c, you exclude 155 so P(X > 155) has normal approximation P(y > 155.5) = 0.6572. normalcdf(155.5,10^99,159,8.6447) = 0.6572. For part d, you exclude 147 so P(X < 147) has normal approximation P(Y < 146.5) = 0.0741. normalcdf(0,146.5,159,8.6447) = 0.0741 For part e,P(X = 175) has normal approximation P(174.5 < Y < 175.5) = 0.0083. 416 Chapter 7 | The Central Limit Theorem This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 normalcdf(174.5,175.5,159,8.6447) = 0.0083 Because of calculators and computer software that let you calculate binomial probabilities for large values of n easily, it is not necessary to use the the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, provided that you have access to these technology tools. Most school labs have Microsoft Excel, an example of computer software that calculates binomial probabilities. Many students have access to the TI-83 or 84 series calculators, and they easily calculate probabilities for the binomial distribution. If you type in \"binomial probability distribution calculation\" in an Internet browser, you can find at least one online calculator for the binomial. For Example 7.10, the probabilities are calculated using the following binomial distribution: (n = 300 and p = 0.53). Compare the binomial and normal distribution answers. See Discrete Random Variables for help with calculator instructions for the binomial. P(X ≥ 150) :1 - binomialcdf(300,0.53,149) = 0.8641 P(X ≤ 160) :binomialcdf(300,0.53,160) = 0.5684 P(X > 155) :1 - binomialcdf(300,0.53,155) = 0.6576 P(X < 147) :binomialcdf(300,0.53,146) = 0.0742 P(X = 175) :(You use the binomial pdf.)binomialpdf(300,0.53,175) = 0.0083 7.12 In a city, 46 percent of the population favor the incumbent, Dawn Morgan, for mayor. A simple random sample of 500 is taken.

Given a random variable (RV) with known mean μ and known standard deviation, σ, we are sampling with size n, and we are interested in two new RVs: the sample mean, X ¯ , and the sample sum, ΣΧ. If the size (n) of the sample is sufficiently large, then X ¯ ~ N(μ, σ n ) and ΣΧ ~ N(nμ, ( n)(σ)). If the size (n) of the sample is sufficiently large, then the distribution of the sample means and the distribution of the sample sums will approximate a normal distributions regardless of the shape of the population. The mean of the sample means will equal the population mean, and the mean of the sample sums will equal n times the population mean. The standard deviation of the distribution of the sample means, σ n , is called the standard error of the mean. a continuous random variable (RV) that appears when we are interested in the intervals of time between some random events, for example, the length of time between emergency arrivals at a hospital, notation: X ~ Exp(m). The mean is μ = 1 m and the standard deviation is σ = 1 m . The probability density function is f(x) = me–mx, x ≥ 0 and the cumulative distribution function is P(X ≤ x) = 1 – e–mx. a number that measures the central tendency; a common name for mean is \"average.\" The term \"mean\" is a shortened form of \"arithmetic mean.\" By definition, the mean for a sample (denoted by x¯ ) is x¯ = Sum of all values in the sample Number of values in the sample , and the mean for a population (denoted by μ) is µ = Sum of all values in the population Number of values in the population . a continuous random variable (RV) with pdf f (x) = 1 σ 2π e – (x – µ)2 2σ2 , where μ is the mean of the distribution and σ is the standard deviation; notation: Χ ~ N(μ, σ). If μ = 0 and σ = 1, the RV is called a standard normal distribution. a continuous random variable (RV) with pdf f (x) = 1 σ 2π e – (x – µ)2 2σ2 , where μ is the mean of the distribution and σ is the standard deviation.; notation: X ~ N(μ, σ). If μ = 0 and σ = 1, the RV is called the standard normal distribution. Given simple random samples of size n from a given population with a measured characteristic such as mean, proportion, or standard deviation for each sample, the probability distribution of all the measured characteristics is called a sampling distribution. the standard deviation of the distribution of the sample means, or σ n . a continuous random variable (RV) that has equally likely outcomes over the domain, a < x < b; often referred as the Rectangular Distribution because the graph of the pdf has the form of a rectangle. Notation: X ~ U(a, b). The mean is µ = a + b 2 and the standard deviation is σ = (b – a) 2 12 . The probability density function is f (x) = 1 b –a for a < x < b or a ≤ x ≤ b. The cumulative distribution is P(X ≤ x) = x– a b – a . Chapter 7 | The Central Limit Theorem 425 CHAPTER REVIEW 7.1 The Central Limit Theorem for Sample Means (Averages) In a population whose distribution may be known or unknown, if the size (n) of samples is sufficiently large, the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normal. The mean of the sample means will equal the population mean. The standard deviation of the distribution of the sample means, called the standard error of the mean, is equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size (n). 7.2 The Central Limit Theorem for Sums The central limit theorem tells us that for a population with any distribution, the distribution of the sums for the sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases. In other words, if the sample size is large enough, the distribution of the sums can be approximated by a normal distribution even if the original population is not normally distributed. Additionally, if the original population has a mean of μX and a standard deviation of σx, the mean of the sums is nμx and the standard deviation is (n)(σx) where n is the sample size. 7.3 Using the Central Limit Theorem The central limit theorem can be used to illustrate the law of large numbers. The law of large numbers states that the larger the sample size you take from a population, the closer the sample mean x¯ gets to μ.

You can use confidence intervals to answer this question. (credit: comedy_nose/flickr) Introduction Chapter Objectives By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: • Calculate and interpret confidence intervals for estimating a population mean and a population proportion. • Interpret the Student's t probability distribution as the sample size changes. • Discriminate between problems applying the normal and the Student's t distributions. • Calculate the sample size required to estimate a population mean and a population proportion given a desired confidence level and margin of error. Suppose you were trying to determine the mean rent of a two-bedroom apartment in your town. You might look in the classified section of the newspaper, write down several rents listed, and average them together. You would have obtained a point estimate of the true mean. If you are trying to determine the percentage of times you make a basket when shooting a basketball, you might count the number of shots you make and divide that by the number of shots you attempted. In this case, you would have obtained a point estimate for the true proportion. Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals 443 We use sample data to make generalizations about an unknown population. This part of statistics is called inferential statistics. The sample data help us to make an estimate of a population parameter. We realize that the point estimate is most likely not the exact value of the population parameter, but close to it. After calculating point estimates, we construct interval estimates, called confidence intervals. In this chapter, you will learn to construct and interpret confidence intervals. You will also learn a new distribution, the Student's-t, and how it is used with these intervals. Throughout the chapter, it is important to keep in mind that the confidence interval is a random variable. It is the population parameter that is fixed. If you worked in the marketing department of an entertainment company, you might be interested in the mean number of songs a consumer downloads a month from iTunes. If so, you could conduct a survey and calculate the sample mean, x¯ , and the sample standard deviation, s. You would use x¯ to estimate the population mean and s to estimate the population standard deviation. The sample mean, x¯ , is the point estimate for the population mean, μ. The sample standard deviation, s, is the point estimate for the population standard deviation, σ. Each of x¯ and s is called a statistic. A confidence interval is another type of estimate but, instead of being just one number, it is an interval of numbers. It provides a range of reasonable values in which we expect the population parameter to fall. There is no guarantee that a given confidence interval does capture the parameter, but there is a predictable probability of success. Suppose, for the iTunes example, we do not know the population mean μ, but we do know that the population standard deviation is σ = 1 and our sample size is 100. Then, by the central limit theorem, the standard deviation for the sample mean is σ n = 1 100 = 0.1. The empirical rule, which applies to bell-shaped distributions, says that in approximately 95% of the samples, the sample mean, x¯ , will be within two standard deviations of the population mean μ. For our iTunes example, two standard deviations is (2)(0.1) = 0.2. The sample mean x¯ is likely to be within 0.2 units of μ. Because x¯ is within 0.2 units of μ, which is unknown, then μ is likely to be within 0.2 units of x¯ in 95% of the samples. The population mean μ is contained in an interval whose lower number is calculated by taking the sample mean and subtracting two standard deviations (2)(0.1) and whose upper number is calculated by taking the sample mean and adding two standard deviations. In other words, μ is between x¯ − 0.2and x¯ + 0.2in 95% of all the samples. For the iTunes example, suppose that a sample produced a sample mean x¯ = 2. Then the unknown population mean μ is between x¯ − 0.2 = 2 − 0.2 = 1.8and x¯ + 0.2 = 2 + 0.2 = 2.2 We say that we are 95% confident that the unknown population mean number of songs downloaded from iTunes per month is between 1.8 and 2.2. The 95% confidence interval is (1.8, 2.2). The 95% confidence interval implies two possibilities. Either the interval (1.8, 2.2) contains the true mean μ or our sample produced an x¯ that is not within 0.2 units of the true mean μ. The second possibility happens for only 5% of all the samples (95–100%). Remember that a confidence interval is created for an unknown population parameter like the population mean, μ. Confidence intervals for some parameters have the form: (point estimate – margin of error, point estimate + margin of error) The margin of error depends on the confidence level or percentage of confidence and the standard error of the mean. When you read newspapers and journals, some reports will use the phrase \"margin of error.\" Other reports will not use that phrase, but include a confidence interval as the point estimate plus or minus the margin of error. These are two ways of expressing the same concept. 444 Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 NOTE Although the text only covers symmetrical confidence intervals, there are non-symmetrical confidence intervals (for example, a confidence interval for the standard deviation). Have your instructor record the number of meals each student in your class eats out in a week. Assume that the standard deviation is known to be three meals. Construct an approximate 95% confidence interval for the true mean number of meals students eat out each week. 1. Calculate the sample mean. 2. Let σ = 3 and n = the number of students surveyed. 3. Construct the interval ⎛ ⎝x¯ − 2 ⋅σ n , x¯ + 2 ⋅σ n ⎞ ⎠. We say we are approximately 95% confident that the true mean number of meals that students eat out in a week is between __________ and ___________. 8.1 | A Single Population Mean using the Normal Distribution A confidence interval for a population mean with a known standard deviation is based on the fact that the sample means follow an approximately normal distribution. Suppose that our sample has a mean of x¯ = 10and we have constructed the 90% confidence interval (5, 15) where EBM = 5. Calculating the Confidence Interval To construct a confidence interval for a single unknown population mean μ, where the population standard deviation is known, we need x¯ as an estimate for μ and we need the margin of error. Here, the margin of error (EBM) is called the error bound for a population mean (abbreviated EBM). The sample mean x¯ is the point estimate of the unknown population mean μ. The confidence interval estimate will have the form: (point estimate - error bound, point estimate + error bound) or, in symbols,( x¯ –EBM, x¯ +EBM) The margin of error (EBM) depends on the confidence level (abbreviated CL). The confidence level is often considered the probability that the calculated confidence interval estimate will contain the true population parameter. However, it is more accurate to state that the confidence level is the percent of confidence intervals that contain the true population parameter when repeated samples are taken. Most often, it is the choice of the person constructing the confidence interval to choose a confidence level of 90% or higher because that person wants to be reasonably certain of his or her conclusions. There is another probability called alpha (α). α is related to the confidence level, CL. α is the probability that the interval does not contain the unknown population parameter. Mathematically, α + CL = 1. Example 8.1 Suppose we have collected data from a sample. We know the sample mean but we do not know the mean for the entire population. The sample mean is seven, and the error bound for the mean is 2.5. Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals 445 x¯ = 7 and EBM = 2.5 The confidence interval is (7 – 2.5, 7 + 2.5), and calculating the values gives (4.5, 9.5). If the confidence level (CL) is 95%, then we say that, \"We estimate with 95% confidence that the true value of the population mean is between 4.5 and 9.5.\" 8.1 Suppose we have data from a sample. The sample mean is 15, and the error bound for the mean is 3.2. What is the confidence interval estimate for the population mean? A confidence interval for a population mean with a known standard deviation is based on the fact that the sample means follow an approximately normal distribution. Suppose that our sample has a mean of x¯ = 10, and we have constructed the 90% confidence interval (5, 15) where EBM = 5. To get a 90% confidence interval, we must include the central 90% of the probability of the normal distribution. If we include the central 90%, we leave out a total of α = 10% in both tails, or 5% in each tail, of the normal distribution. Figure 8.2 To capture the central 90%, we must go out 1.645 \"standard deviations\" on either side of the calculated sample mean. The value 1.645 is the z-score from a standard normal probability distribution that puts an area of 0.90 in the center, an area of 0.05 in the far left tail, and an area of 0.05 in the far right tail. It is important that the \"standard deviation\" used must be appropriate for the parameter we are estimating, so in this section we need to use the standard deviation that applies to sample means, which is σ n . The fraction σ n , is commonly called the \"standard error of the mean\" in order to distinguish clearly the standard deviation for a mean from the population standard deviation σ. In summary, as a result of the central limit theorem: • X ¯ is normally distributed, that is, X ¯ ~ N ⎛ ⎝µ X, σ n ⎞ ⎠. • When the population standard deviation σ is known, we use a normal distribution to calculate the error bound. Calculating the Confidence Interval To construct a confidence interval estimate for an unknown population mean, we need data from a random sample. The steps to construct and interpret the confidence interval are: • Calculate the sample mean x¯ from the sample data. Remember, in this section we already know the population standard deviation σ. • Find the z-score that corresponds to the confidence level. 446 Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 • Calculate the error bound EBM. • Construct the confidence interval. • Write a sentence that interprets the estimate in the context of the situation in the problem. (Explain what the confidence interval means, in the words of the problem.) We will first examine each step in more detail, and then illustrate the process with some examples. Finding the z-score for the Stated Confidence Level When we know the population standard deviation σ, we use a standard normal distribution to calculate the error bound EBM and construct the confidence interval. We need to find the value of z that puts an area equal to the confidence level (in decimal form) in the middle of the standard normal distribution Z ~ N(0, 1). The confidence level, CL, is the area in the middle of the standard normal distribution. CL = 1 – α, so α is the area that is split equally between the two tails. Each of the tails contains an area equal to α 2 . The z-score that has an area to the right of α 2is denoted by z α 2 . For example, when CL = 0.95, α = 0.05 and α 2= 0.025; we write z α 2 = z0.025. The area to the right of z0.025 is 0.025 and the area to the left of z0.025 is 1 – 0.025 = 0.975. z α 2 = z0.025 = 1.96, using a calculator, computer or a standard normal probability table. invNorm(0.975, 0, 1) = 1.96 NOTE Remember to use the area to the LEFT of z α 2 ; in this chapter the last two inputs in the invNorm command are 0, 1, because you are using a standard normal distribution Z ~ N(0, 1). Calculating the Error Bound (EBM) The error bound formula for an unknown population mean μ when the population standard deviation σ is known is • EBM = ⎛ ⎝z α 2 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ σ n ⎞ ⎠ Constructing the Confidence Interval • The confidence interval estimate has the format (x¯ –EBM, x¯ + EBM). The graph gives a picture of the entire situation. CL + α 2+ α 2= CL + α = 1. Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals 447 Figure 8.3 Writing the Interpretation The interpretation should clearly state the confidence level (CL), explain what population parameter is being estimated (here, a population mean), and state the confidence interval (both endpoints). \"We estimate with ___% confidence that the true population mean (include the context of the problem) is between ___ and ___ (include appropriate units).\" Example 8.2 Suppose scores on exams in statistics are normally distributed with an unknown population mean and a population standard deviation of three points. A random sample of 36 scores is taken and gives a sample mean (sample mean score) of 68. Find a confidence interval estimate for the population mean exam score (the mean score on all exams). Find a 90% confidence interval for the true (population) mean of statistics exam scores. Solution 8.2 • You can use technology to calculate the confidence interval directly. • The first solution is shown step-by-step (Solution A). • The second solution uses the TI-83, 83+, and 84+ calculators (Solution B). Solution A To find the confidence interval, you need the sample mean, x¯ , and the EBM. x¯ = 68 EBM = ⎛ ⎝z α 2 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ σ n ⎞ ⎠ σ = 3; n = 36; The confidence level is 90% (CL = 0.90) CL = 0.90 so α = 1 – CL = 1 – 0.90 = 0.10 α 2= 0.05 z α 2 =z0.05 The area to the right of z0.05 is 0.05 and the area to the left of z0.05 is 1 – 0.05 = 0.95. z α 2 = z0.05 = 1.645 using invNorm(0.95, 0, 1) on the TI-83,83+, and 84+ calculators. This can also be found using appropriate commands on other calculators, using a computer, or using a probability table for the standard normal distribution. EBM = (1.645) ⎛ ⎝ 3 36 ⎞ ⎠= 0.8225 448 Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 x¯ - EBM = 68 - 0.8225 = 67.1775 x¯ + EBM = 68 + 0.8225 = 68.8225 The 90% confidence interval is (67.1775, 68.8225).

Interpretation We estimate with 90% confidence that the true population mean exam score for all statistics students is between 67.18 and 68.82. Explanation of 90% Confidence Level Ninety percent of all confidence intervals constructed in this way contain the true mean statistics exam score. For example, if we constructed 100 of these confidence intervals, we would expect 90 of them to contain the true population mean exam score. 8.2 Suppose average pizza delivery times are normally distributed with an unknown population mean and a population standard deviation of six minutes. A random sample of 28 pizza delivery restaurants is taken and has a sample mean delivery time of 36 minutes. Find a 90% confidence interval estimate for the population mean delivery time. Example 8.3 The Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for a cell phone measures the amount of radio frequency (RF) energy absorbed by the user’s body when using the handset. Every cell phone emits RF energy. Different phone models have different SAR measures. To receive certification from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for sale in the United States, the SAR level for a cell phone must be no more than 1.6 watts per kilogram. Table 8.1 shows the highest SAR level for a random selection of cell phone models as measured by the FCC.

Assume that the population standard deviation is σ = 0.337. Solution 8.3 Solution A To find the confidence interval, start by finding the point estimate: the sample mean. x¯ = 1.024 Next, find the EBM. Because you are creating a 98% confidence interval, CL = 0.98. Figure 8.4 You need to find z0.01 having the property that the area under the normal density curve to the right of z0.01 is 0.01 and the area to the left is 0.99.

These intervals are different for several reasons: they were calculated from different samples, the samples were different sizes, and the intervals were calculated for different levels of confidence. Even though the intervals are different, they do not yield conflicting information. The effects of these kinds of changes are the subject of the next section in this chapter. Changing the Confidence Level or Sample Size Example 8.4 Suppose we change the original problem in Example 8.2 by using a 95% confidence level. Find a 95% confidence interval for the true (population) mean statistics exam score. Solution 8.4 To find the confidence interval, you need the sample mean, x¯ , and the EBM. x¯ = 68 EBM = ⎛ ⎝z α 2 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ σ n ⎞ ⎠ σ = 3; n = 36; The confidence level is 95% (CL = 0.95). CL = 0.95 so α = 1 – CL = 1 – 0.95 = 0.05 α 2 = 0.025   z α 2 =z0.025 The area to the right of z0.025 is 0.025 and the area to the left of z0.025 is 1 – 0.025 = 0.975. 452 Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 z α 2 =z0.025= 1.96 when using invnorm(0.975,0,1) on the TI-83, 83+, or 84+ calculators. (This can also be found using appropriate commands on other calculators, using a computer, or using a probability table for the standard normal distribution.) EBM = (1.96) ⎛ ⎝ 3 36 ⎞ ⎠= 0.98 x¯ – EBM = 68 – 0.98 = 67.02 x¯ + EBM = 68 + 0.98 = 68.98 Notice that the EBM is larger for a 95% confidence level in the original problem. Interpretation We estimate with 95% confidence that the true population mean for all statistics exam scores is between 67.02 and 68.98. Explanation of 95% Confidence Level Ninety-five percent of all confidence intervals constructed in this way contain the true value of the population mean statistics exam score. Comparing the results The 90% confidence interval is (67.18, 68.82). The 95% confidence interval is (67.02, 68.98). The 95% confidence interval is wider. If you look at the graphs, because the area 0.95 is larger than the area 0.90, it makes sense that the 95% confidence interval is wider. To be more confident that the confidence interval actually does contain the true value of the population mean for all statistics exam scores, the confidence interval necessarily needs to be wider. Figure 8.5 Summary: Effect of Changing the Confidence Level • Increasing the confidence level increases the error bound, making the confidence interval wider. • Decreasing the confidence level decreases the error bound, making the confidence interval narrower. 8.4 Refer back to the pizza-delivery Try It exercise. The population standard deviation is six minutes and the sample mean deliver time is 36 minutes. Use a sample size of 20. Find a 95% confidence interval estimate for the true mean pizza delivery time. Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals 453 Example 8.5 Suppose we change the original problem in Example 8.2 to see what happens to the error bound if the sample size is changed. Leave everything the same except the sample size. Use the original 90% confidence level. What happens to the error bound and the confidence interval if we increase the sample size and use n = 100 instead of n = 36? What happens if we decrease the sample size to n = 25 instead of n = 36? • x¯ = 68 • EBM = ⎛ ⎝z α 2 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ σ n ⎞ ⎠ • σ = 3; The confidence level is 90% (CL=0.90); z α 2 = z0.05 = 1.645. Solution 8.5 Solution A If we increase the sample size n to 100, we decrease the error bound. When n = 100: EBM = ⎛ ⎝z α 2 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ σ n ⎞ ⎠= (1.645) ⎛ ⎝ 3 100 ⎞ ⎠= 0.4935. Solution 8.5 Solution B If we decrease the sample size n to 25, we increase the error bound. When n = 25: EBM = ⎛ ⎝z α 2 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ σ n ⎞ ⎠= (1.645) ⎛ ⎝ 3 25 ⎞ ⎠= 0.987. Summary: Effect of Changing the Sample Size • Increasing the sample size causes the error bound to decrease, making the confidence interval narrower. • Decreasing the sample size causes the error bound to increase, making the confidence interval wider. 8.5 Refer back to the pizza-delivery Try It exercise. The mean delivery time is 36 minutes and the population standard deviation is six minutes. Assume the sample size is changed to 50 restaurants with the same sample mean. Find a 90% confidence interval estimate for the population mean delivery time. Working Backwards to Find the Error Bound or Sample Mean When we calculate a confidence interval, we find the sample mean, calculate the error bound, and use them to calculate the confidence interval. However, sometimes when we read statistical studies, the study may state the confidence interval only. If we know the confidence interval, we can work backwards to find both the error bound and the sample mean. Finding the Error Bound • From the upper value for the interval, subtract the sample mean, • OR, from the upper value for the interval, subtract the lower value. Then divide the difference by two. Finding the Sample Mean • Subtract the error bound from the upper value of the confidence interval, 454 Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 • OR, average the upper and lower endpoints of the confidence interval. Notice that there are two methods to perform each calculation. You can choose the method that is easier to use with the information you know. Example 8.6 Suppose we know that a confidence interval is (67.18, 68.82) and we want to find the error bound. We may know that the sample mean is 68, or perhaps our source only gave the confidence interval and did not tell us the value of the sample mean. Calculate the Error Bound: • If we know that the sample mean is 68: EBM = 68.82 – 68 = 0.82. • If we don't know the sample mean: EBM = (68.82 − 67.18) 2 = 0.82. Calculate the Sample Mean: • If we know the error bound: x¯ = 68.82 – 0.82 = 68 • If we don't know the error bound: x¯ = (67.18 + 68.82) 2 = 68. 8.6 Suppose we know that a confidence interval is (42.12, 47.88). Find the error bound and the sample mean. Calculating the Sample Size n If researchers desire a specific margin of error, then they can use the error bound formula to calculate the required sample size. The error bound formula for a population mean when the population standard deviation is known is EBM = ⎛ ⎝z α 2 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ σ n ⎞ ⎠. The formula for sample size is n = z2σ 2 EBM 2, found by solving the error bound formula for n. In this formula, z is z α 2 , corresponding to the desired confidence level. A researcher planning a study who wants a specified confidence level and error bound can use this formula to calculate the size of the sample needed for the study. Example 8.7 The population standard deviation for the age of Foothill College students is 15 years. If we want to be 95% confident that the sample mean age is within two years of the true population mean age of Foothill College students, how many randomly selected Foothill College students must be surveyed? From the problem, we know that σ = 15 and EBM = 2. z = z0.025 = 1.96, because the confidence level is 95%. n = z2σ 2 EBM 2 = (1.96) 2(15) 2 2 2 = 216.09 using the sample size equation. Use n = 217: Always round the answer UP to the next higher integer to ensure that the sample size is large enough. Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals 455 Therefore, 217 Foothill College students should be surveyed in order to be 95% confident that we are within two years of the true population mean age of Foothill College students. 8.7 The population standard deviation for the height of high school basketball players is three inches. If we want to be 95% confident that the sample mean height is within one inch of the true population mean height, how many randomly selected students must be surveyed? 8.2 | A Single Population Mean using the Student t Distribution In practice, we rarely know the population standard deviation. In the past, when the sample size was large, this did not present a problem to statisticians. They used the sample standard deviation s as an estimate for σ and proceeded as before to calculate a confidence interval with close enough results. However, statisticians ran into problems when the sample size was small. A small sample size caused inaccuracies in the confidence interval. William S. Goset (1876–1937) of the Guinness brewery in Dublin, Ireland ran into this problem. His experiments with hops and barley produced very few samples. Just replacing σ with s did not produce accurate results when he tried to calculate a confidence interval. He realized that he could not use a normal distribution for the calculation; he found that the actual distribution depends on the sample size. This problem led him to \"discover\" what is called the Student's t-distribution. The name comes from the fact that Gosset wrote under the pen name \"Student.\" Up until the mid-1970s, some statisticians used the normal distribution approximation for large sample sizes and used the Student's t-distribution only for sample sizes of at most 30. With graphing calculators and computers, the practice now is to use the Student's t-distribution whenever s is used as an estimate for σ. If you draw a simple random sample of size n from a population that has an approximately normal distribution with mean μ and unknown population standard deviation σ and calculate the t-score t = x¯ –µ ⎛ ⎝ s n ⎞ ⎠ , then the t-scores follow a Student's t-distribution with n – 1 degrees of freedom. The t-score has the same interpretation as the z-score. It measures how far x¯ is from its mean μ. For each sample size n, there is a different Student's t-distribution. The degrees of freedom, n – 1, come from the calculation of the sample standard deviation s. In Appendix H, we used n deviations (x–x¯ values)to calculate s. Because the sum of the deviations is zero, we can find the last deviation once we know the other n – 1 deviations. The other n – 1 deviations can change or vary freely. We call the number n – 1 the degrees of freedom (df). Properties of the Student's t-Distribution • The graph for the Student's t-distribution is similar to the standard normal curve. • The mean for the Student's t-distribution is zero and the distribution is symmetric about zero. • The Student's t-distribution has more probability in its tails than the standard normal distribution because the spread of the t-distribution is greater than the spread of the standard normal. So the graph of the Student's t-distribution will be thicker in the tails and shorter in the center than the graph of the standard normal distribution. • The exact shape of the Student's t-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom. As the degrees of freedom increases, the graph of Student's t-distribution becomes more like the graph of the standard normal distribution. • The underlying population of individual observations is assumed to be normally distributed with unknown population mean μ and unknown population standard deviation σ. The size of the underlying population is generally not relevant unless it is very small. If it is bell shaped (normal) then the assumption is met and doesn't need discussion. Random sampling is assumed, but that is a completely separate assumption from normality. Calculators and computers can easily calculate any Student's t-probabilities. The TI-83,83+, and 84+ have a tcdf function 456 Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 to find the probability for given values of t. The grammar for the tcdf command is tcdf(lower bound, upper bound, degrees of freedom). However for confidence intervals, we need to use inverse probability to find the value of t when we know the probability. For the TI-84+ you can use the invT command on the DISTRibution menu. The invT command works similarly to the invnorm. The invT command requires two inputs: invT(area to the left, degrees of freedom) The output is the t-score that corresponds to the area we specified. The TI-83 and 83+ do not have the invT command. (The TI-89 has an inverse T command.) A probability table for the Student's t-distribution can also be used. The table gives t-scores that correspond to the confidence level (column) and degrees of freedom (row). (The TI-86 does not have an invT program or command, so if you are using that calculator, you need to use a probability table for the Student's t-Distribution.) When using a t-table, note that some tables are formatted to show the confidence level in the column headings, while the column headings in some tables may show only corresponding area in one or both tails. A Student's t table (See Appendix H) gives t-scores given the degrees of freedom and the right-tailed probability. The table is very limited. Calculators and computers can easily calculate any Student's t-probabilities. The notation for the Student's t-distribution (using T as the random variable) is: • T ~ tdf where df = n – 1. • For example, if we have a sample of size n = 20 items, then we calculate the degrees of freedom as df = n - 1 = 20 - 1 = 19 and we write the distribution as T ~ t19. If the population standard deviation is not known, the error bound for a population mean is: • EBM= ⎛ ⎝t α 2 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ s n ⎞ ⎠, • t σ 2 is the t-score with area to the right equal to α 2 , • use df = n – 1 degrees of freedom, and • s = sample standard deviation. The format for the confidence interval is: (x¯ −EBM, x¯ + EBM). To calculate the confidence interval directly: Press STAT. Arrow over to TESTS.

Industrial chemicals may enter the body through pollution or as ingredients in consumer products. In October 2008, the scientists at HTP tested cord blood samples for 20 newborn infants in the United States. The cord blood of the \"In utero/newborn\" group was tested for 430 industrial compounds, pollutants, and other chemicals, including chemicals linked to brain and nervous system toxicity, immune system toxicity, and reproductive toxicity, and fertility problems. There are health concerns about the effects of some chemicals on the brain and nervous system. Table 8.2 shows how many of the targeted chemicals were found in each infant’s cord blood. 79 145 147 160 116 100 159 151 156 126 137 83 156 94 121 144 123 114 139 99 Table 8.3 Use this sample data to construct a 90% confidence interval for the mean number of targeted industrial chemicals to be found in an in infant’s blood. Solution 8.9 Solution A From the sample, you can calculate x¯ = 127.45 and s = 25.965. There are 20 infants in the sample, so n = 20, and df = 20 – 1 = 19. You are asked to calculate a 90% confidence interval: CL = 0.90, so α = 1 – CL = 1 – 0.90 = 0.10 α 2 = 0.05,t α 2 =t0.05 By definition, the area to the right of t0.05 is 0.05 and so the area to the left of t0.05 is 1 – 0.05 = 0.95. Use a table, calculator, or computer to find that t0.05 = 1.729. EBM=t α 2 ⎛ ⎝ s n ⎞ ⎠= 1.729 ⎛ ⎝ 25.965 20 ⎞ ⎠ ≈ 10.038 x¯ – EBM = 127.45 – 10.038 = 117.412 x¯ + EBM = 127.45 + 10.038 = 137.488 We estimate with 90% confidence that the mean number of all targeted industrial chemicals found in cord blood in the United States is between 117.412 and 137.488.

For example, a poll for a particular candidate running for president might show that the candidate has 40% of the vote within three percentage points (if the sample is large enough). Often, election polls are calculated with 95% confidence, so, the pollsters would be 95% confident that the true proportion of voters who favored the candidate would be between 0.37 and 0.43: (0.40 – 0.03,0.40 + 0.03). Investors in the stock market are interested in the true proportion of stocks that go up and down each week. Businesses that sell personal computers are interested in the proportion of households in the United States that own personal computers. Confidence intervals can be calculated for the true proportion of stocks that go up or down each week and for the true proportion of households in the United States that own personal computers. The procedure to find the confidence interval, the sample size, the error bound, and the confidence level for a proportion is similar to that for the population mean, but the formulas are different. How do you know you are dealing with a proportion problem? First, the underlying distribution is a binomial distribution. (There is no mention of a mean or average.) If X is a binomial random variable, then X ~ B(n, p) where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of a success. To form a proportion, take X, the random variable for the number of successes and divide it by n, the number of trials (or the sample size). The random variable P′ (read \"P prime\") is that proportion, P′ =X n 460 Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 (Sometimes the random variable is denoted as P ^ , read \"P hat\".) When n is large and p is not close to zero or one, we can use the normal distribution to approximate the binomial. X ~ N(np, npq) If we divide the random variable, the mean, and the standard deviation by n, we get a normal distribution of proportions with P′, called the estimated proportion, as the random variable. (Recall that a proportion as the number of successes divided by n.) X n=P′ ~ N⎛ ⎝ np n, npq n ⎞ ⎠ Using algebra to simplify : npq n = pq n P′ follows a normal distribution for proportions: X n=P′ ~ N⎛ ⎝ np n, npq n ⎞ ⎠ The confidence interval has the form (p′ – EBP, p′ + EBP). EBP is error bound for the proportion. p′ = x n p′ = the estimated proportion of successes (p′ is a point estimate for p, the true proportion.) x = the number of successes n = the size of the sample The error bound for a proportion is EBP= ⎛ ⎝z α 2 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ p′ q′ n ⎞ ⎠ where q′ = 1 – p′ This formula is similar to the error bound formula for a mean, except that the \"appropriate standard deviation\" is different. For a mean, when the population standard deviation is known, the appropriate standard deviation that we use is σ n . For a proportion, the appropriate standard deviation is pq n. However, in the error bound formula, we use p′ q′ n as the standard deviation, instead of pq n. In the error bound formula, the sample proportions p′ and q′ are estimates of the unknown population proportions p and q. The estimated proportions p′ and q′ are used because p and q are not known. The sample proportions p′ and q′ are calculated from the data: p′ is the estimated proportion of successes, and q′ is the estimated proportion of failures. The confidence interval can be used only if the number of successes np′ and the number of failures nq′ are both greater than five. NOTE For the normal distribution of proportions, the z-score formula is as follows. If P′ ~N⎛ ⎝p, pq n ⎞ ⎠then the z-score formula is z = p′ −p pq n Example 8.10 Suppose that a market research firm is hired to estimate the percent of adults living in a large city who have cell phones. Five hundred randomly selected adult residents in this city are surveyed to determine whether they have cell phones. Of the 500 people surveyed, 421 responded yes - they own cell phones. Using a 95% confidence level, compute a confidence interval estimate for the true proportion of adult residents of this city who have cell phones. Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals 461 Solution 8.10 Solution A • The first solution is step-by-step (Solution A). • The second solution uses a function of the TI-83, 83+ or 84 calculators (Solution B). Let X = the number of people in the sample who have cell phones. X is binomial. X ~ B ⎛ ⎝500, 421 500 ⎞ ⎠. To calculate the confidence interval, you must find p′, q′, and EBP. n = 500 x = the number of successes = 421 p′ =x n=421 500 = 0.842 p′ = 0.842 is the sample proportion; this is the point estimate of the population proportion. q′ = 1 – p′ = 1 – 0.842 = 0.158 Since CL = 0.95, then α = 1 – CL = 1 – 0.95 = 0.05 ⎛ ⎝ α 2 ⎞ ⎠= 0.025. Then z α 2 =z0.025= 1.96 Use the TI-83, 83+, or 84+ calculator command invNorm(0.975,0,1) to find z0.025. Remember that the area to the right of z0.025 is 0.025 and the area to the left of z0.025 is 0.975. This can also be found using appropriate commands on other calculators, using a computer, or using a Standard Normal probability table. EBP= ⎛ ⎝z α 2 ⎞ ⎠ p′ q′ n = (1.96) (0.842)(0.158) 500 = 0.032 p ' –EBP= 0.842 – 0.032 = 0.81 p′ + EBP= 0.842 + 0.032 = 0.874 The confidence interval for the true binomial population proportion is (p′ – EBP, p′ + EBP) = (0.810, 0.874). Interpretation We estimate with 95% confidence that between 81% and 87.4% of all adult residents of this city have cell phones.

In a sample of 300 students, 68% said they own an iPod and a smart phone. Compute a 97% confidence interval for the true percent of students who own an iPod and a smartphone. “Plus Four” Confidence Interval for p There is a certain amount of error introduced into the process of calculating a confidence interval for a proportion. Because we do not know the true proportion for the population, we are forced to use point estimates to calculate the appropriate standard deviation of the sampling distribution. Studies have shown that the resulting estimation of the standard deviation can be flawed. Fortunately, there is a simple adjustment that allows us to produce more accurate confidence intervals. We simply pretend that we have four additional observations. Two of these observations are successes and two are failures. The new sample size, then, is n + 4, and the new count of successes is x + 2. Computer studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method. It should be used when the confidence level desired is at least 90% and the sample size is at least ten. Example 8.12 A random sample of 25 statistics students was asked: “Have you smoked a cigarette in the past week?” Six students reported smoking within the past week.

Use the “plus-four” method to find a 90% confidence interval for the true proportion of teens that would report having more than 500 Facebook friends based on this larger sample. Compare the results to those in Example 8.13. 466 Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Calculating the Sample Size n If researchers desire a specific margin of error, then they can use the error bound formula to calculate the required sample size. The error bound formula for a population proportion is • EBP= ⎛ ⎝z α 2 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ p′ q′ n ⎞ ⎠ • Solving for n gives you an equation for the sample size. • n= ⎛ ⎝z α 2 ⎞ ⎠ 2 (p′ q′) EBP 2 Example 8.14 Suppose a mobile phone company wants to determine the current percentage of customers aged 50+ who use text messaging on their cell phones. How many customers aged 50+ should the company survey in order to be 90% confident that the estimated (sample) proportion is within three percentage points of the true population proportion of customers aged 50+ who use text messaging on their cell phones. Solution 8.14 From the problem, we know that EBP = 0.03 (3%=0.03) and z α 2 z0.05 = 1.645 because the confidence level is 90%. However, in order to find n, we need to know the estimated (sample) proportion p′. Remember that q′ = 1 – p′. But, we do not know p′ yet. Since we multiply p′ and q′ together, we make them both equal to 0.5 because p′q′ = (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25 results in the largest possible product. (Try other products: (0.6)(0.4) = 0.24; (0.3)(0.7) = 0.21; (0.2)(0.8) = 0.16 and so on). The largest possible product gives us the largest n. This gives us a large enough sample so that we can be 90% confident that we are within three percentage points of the true population proportion. To calculate the sample size n, use the formula and make the substitutions. n=z2p′ q′ EBP 2 gives n=1.645 2(0.5)(0.5) 0.03 2 = 751.7 Round the answer to the next higher value. The sample size should be 752 cell phone customers aged 50+ in order to be 90% confident that the estimated (sample) proportion is within three percentage points of the true population proportion of all customers aged 50+ who use text messaging on their cell phones. 8.14 Suppose an internet marketing company wants to determine the current percentage of customers who click on ads on their smartphones. How many customers should the company survey in order to be 90% confident that the estimated proportion is within five percentage points of the true population proportion of customers who click on ads on their smartphones? 8.4 | Confidence Interval (Home Costs) Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals 467 8.1 Confidence Interval (Home Costs) Class Time: Names: Student Learning Outcomes • The student will calculate the 90% confidence interval for the mean cost of a home in the area in which this school is located. • The student will interpret confidence intervals. • The student will determine the effects of changing conditions on the confidence interval.

However, it is more spread out and flatter at the apex than the normal distribution. • It approaches the standard normal distribution as n get larger. • There is a \"family of t–distributions: each representative of the family is completely defined by the number of degrees of freedom, which is one less than the number of data. CHAPTER REVIEW 8.1 A Single Population Mean using the Normal Distribution In this module, we learned how to calculate the confidence interval for a single population mean where the population 474 Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 standard deviation is known. When estimating a population mean, the margin of error is called the error bound for a population mean (EBM). A confidence interval has the general form: (lower bound, upper bound) = (point estimate – EBM, point estimate + EBM) The calculation of EBM depends on the size of the sample and the level of confidence desired. The confidence level is the percent of all possible samples that can be expected to include the true population parameter. As the confidence level increases, the corresponding EBM increases as well. As the sample size increases, the EBM decreases. By the central limit theorem, EBM=z σ n Given a confidence interval, you can work backwards to find the error bound (EBM) or the sample mean. To find the error bound, find the difference of the upper bound of the interval and the mean. If you do not know the sample mean, you can find the error bound by calculating half the difference of the upper and lower bounds. To find the sample mean given a confidence interval, find the difference of the upper bound and the error bound. If the error bound is unknown, then average the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval to find the sample mean. Sometimes researchers know in advance that they want to estimate a population mean within a specific margin of error for a given level of confidence. In that case, solve the EBM formula for n to discover the size of the sample that is needed to achieve this goal: n= z2σ 2 EBM 2 8.2 A Single Population Mean using the Student t Distribution In many cases, the researcher does not know the population standard deviation, σ, of the measure being studied. In these cases, it is common to use the sample standard deviation, s, as an estimate of σ. The normal distribution creates accurate confidence intervals when σ is known, but it is not as accurate when s is used as an estimate. In this case, the Student’s t-distribution is much better. Define a t-score using the following formula: t = x¯ − µ s n The t-score follows the Student’s t-distribution with n – 1 degrees of freedom. The confidence interval under this distribution is calculated with EBM = ⎛ ⎝t α 2 ⎞ ⎠ s nwhere t α 2 is the t-score with area to the right equal to α 2 , s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size. Use a table, calculator, or computer to find t α 2 for a given α. 8.3 A Population Proportion Some statistical measures, like many survey questions, measure qualitative rather than quantitative data. In this case, the population parameter being estimated is a proportion. It is possible to create a confidence interval for the true population proportion following procedures similar to those used in creating confidence intervals for population means. The formulas are slightly different, but they follow the same reasoning. Let p′ represent the sample proportion, x/n, where x represents the number of successes and n represents the sample size. Let q′ = 1 – p′. Then the confidence interval for a population proportion is given by the following formula: (lower bound, upper bound) = (p′ –EBP, p′ +EBP) = ⎛ ⎝ p′ –z p′ q′ n , p′ + z p′ q′ n ⎞ ⎠ The “plus four” method for calculating confidence intervals is an attempt to balance the error introduced by using estimates of the population proportion when calculating the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. Simply imagine four additional trials in the study; two are successes and two are failures. Calculate p′ =x+ 2 n+ 4 , and proceed to find the confidence interval. When sample sizes are small, this method has been demonstrated to provide more accurate confidence intervals than the standard formula used for larger samples. Chapter 8 | Confidence Intervals 475 FORMULA REVIEW 8.1 A Single Population Mean using the Normal Distribution X ¯ ~ N⎛ ⎝µ X, σ n ⎞ ⎠ The distribution of sample means is normally distributed with mean equal to the population mean and standard deviation given by the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. The general form for a confidence interval for a single population mean, known standard deviation, normal distribution is given by (lower bound, upper bound) = (point estimate – EBM, point estimate + EBM) = (x¯ −EBM, x¯ + EBM) = ⎛ ⎝x¯ −z σ n , x¯ + z σ n ⎞ ⎠ EBM = z σ n= the error bound for the mean, or the margin of error for a single population mean; this formula is used when the population standard deviation is known. CL = confidence level, or the proportion of confidence intervals created that are expected to contain the true population parameter α = 1 – CL = the proportion of confidence intervals that will not contain the population parameter z α 2 = the z-score with the property that the area to the right of the z-score is ∝ 2 this is the z-score used in the calculation of \"EBM where α = 1 – CL. n = z2σ 2 EBM 2 = the formula used to determine the sample size (n) needed to achieve a desired margin of error at a given level of confidence General form of a confidence interval (lower value, upper value) = (point estimate−error bound, point estimate + error bound) To find the error bound when you know the confidence interval error bound = upper value−point estimate OR error bound = upper value − lower value 2 Single Population Mean, Known Standard Deviation, Normal Distribution Use the Normal Distribution for Means, Population Standard Deviation is Known EBM = z α 2 ⋅ σ n The confidence interval has the format ( x¯ − EBM, x¯ + EBM). 8.2 A Single Population Mean using the Student t Distribution s = the standard deviation of sample values. t = x¯ −µ s n is the formula for the t-score which measures how far away a measure is from the population mean in the Student’s t-distribution df = n - 1; the degrees of freedom for a Student’s t- distribution where n represents the size of the sample T~tdf the random variable, T, has a Student’s t-distribution with df degrees of freedom EBM=t α 2 s n= the error bound for the population mean when the population standard deviation is unknown t α 2 is the t-score in the Student’s t-distribution with area to the right equal to α 2 The general form for a confidence interval for a single mean, population standard deviation unknown, Student's t is given by (lower bound, upper bound) = (point estimate – EBM, point estimate + EBM) = ⎛ ⎝x¯ –ts n , x¯ + ts n ⎞ ⎠ 8.3 A Population Proportion p′ = x / n where x represents the number of successes and n represents the sample size. The variable p′ is the sample proportion and serves as the point estimate for the true population proportion. q′ = 1 – p′ p′ ~ N⎛ ⎝p, pq n ⎞ ⎠The variable p′ has a binomial distribution that can be approximated with the normal distribution shown here.

The confidence level for this study was reported at 95% with a ±3% margin of error. a. Determine the estimated proportion from the sample. b. Determine the sample size. c. Identify CL and α. d. Calculate the error bound based on the information provided. e. Compare the error bound in part d to the margin of error reported by Gallup. Explain any differences between the values. f. Create a confidence interval for the results of this study. g. A reporter is covering the release of this study for a local news station. How should she explain the confidence interval to her audience? 131. A national survey of 1,000 adults was conducted on May 13, 2013 by Rasmussen Reports. It concluded with 95% confidence that 49% to 55% of Americans believe that big-time college sports programs corrupt the process of higher education. a. Find the point estimate and the error bound for this confidence interval. b. Can we (with 95% confidence) conclude that more than half of all American adults believe this? c. Use the point estimate from part a and n = 1,000 to calculate a 75% confidence interval for the proportion of American adults that believe that major college sports programs corrupt higher education. d. Can we (with 75% confidence) conclude that at least half of all American adults believe this? 132. Public Policy Polling recently conducted a survey asking adults across the U.S. about music preferences. When asked, 80 of the 571 participants admitted that they have illegally downloaded music. a. Create a 99% confidence interval for the true proportion of American adults who have illegally downloaded music. b. This survey was conducted through automated telephone interviews on May 6 and 7, 2013. The error bound of the survey compensates for sampling error, or natural variability among samples. List some factors that could affect the survey’s outcome that are not covered by the margin of error. c. Without performing any calculations, describe how the confidence interval would change if the confidence level changed from 99% to 90%. 133. You plan to conduct a survey on your college campus to learn about the political awareness of students. You want to estimate the true proportion of college students on your campus who voted in the 2012 presidential election with 95% confidence and a margin of error no greater than five percent. How many students must you interview? 134. In a recent Zogby International Poll, nine of 48 respondents rated the likelihood of a terrorist attack in their community as “likely” or “very likely.” Use the “plus four” method to create a 97% confidence interval for the proportion of American adults who believe that a terrorist attack in their community is likely or very likely. Explain what this confidence interval means in the context of the problem. REFERENCES 8.1 A Single Population Mean using the Normal Distribution “American Fact Finder.” U.S. Census Bureau.

(Credit: Robert Neff) Introduction Chapter Objectives By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: • Differentiate between Type I and Type II Errors • Describe hypothesis testing in general and in practice • Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests for a single population mean, population standard deviation known. • Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests for a single population mean, population standard deviation unknown. • Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests for a single population proportion. One job of a statistician is to make statistical inferences about populations based on samples taken from the population. Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample 505 Confidence intervals are one way to estimate a population parameter. Another way to make a statistical inference is to make a decision about a parameter. For instance, a car dealer advertises that its new small truck gets 35 miles per gallon, on average. A tutoring service claims that its method of tutoring helps 90% of its students get an A or a B. A company says that women managers in their company earn an average of $60,000 per year. A statistician will make a decision about these claims. This process is called \" hypothesis testing.\" A hypothesis test involves collecting data from a sample and evaluating the data. Then, the statistician makes a decision as to whether or not there is sufficient evidence, based upon analyses of the data, to reject the null hypothesis. In this chapter, you will conduct hypothesis tests on single means and single proportions. You will also learn about the errors associated with these tests. Hypothesis testing consists of two contradictory hypotheses or statements, a decision based on the data, and a conclusion. To perform a hypothesis test, a statistician will: 1. Set up two contradictory hypotheses. 2. Collect sample data (in homework problems, the data or summary statistics will be given to you). 3. Determine the correct distribution to perform the hypothesis test. 4. Analyze sample data by performing the calculations that ultimately will allow you to reject or decline to reject the null hypothesis. 5. Make a decision and write a meaningful conclusion. NOTE To do the hypothesis test homework problems for this chapter and later chapters, make copies of the appropriate special solution sheets. See Appendix E. 9.1 | Null and Alternative Hypotheses The actual test begins by considering two hypotheses. They are called the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. These hypotheses contain opposing viewpoints. H0: The null hypothesis: It is a statement of no difference between sample means or proportions or no difference between a sample mean or proportion and a population mean or proportion. In other words, the difference equals 0. Ha: The alternative hypothesis: It is a claim about the population that is contradictory to H0 and what we conclude when we reject H0. Since the null and alternative hypotheses are contradictory, you must examine evidence to decide if you have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not. The evidence is in the form of sample data. After you have determined which hypothesis the sample supports, you make a decision. There are two options for a decision. They are \"reject H0\" if the sample information favors the alternative hypothesis or \"do not reject H0\" or \"decline to reject H0\" if the sample information is insufficient to reject the null hypothesis. Mathematical Symbols Used in H0 and Ha: H0 Ha equal (=) not equal (≠) or greater than (>) or less than (<) greater than or equal to (≥) less than (<) less than or equal to (≤) more than (>) Table 9.1 NOTE H0 always has a symbol with an equal in it. Ha never has a symbol with an equal in it. The choice of symbol depends 506 Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 on the wording of the hypothesis test. However, be aware that many researchers (including one of the co-authors in research work) use = in the null hypothesis, even with > or < as the symbol in the alternative hypothesis. This practice is acceptable because we only make the decision to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. Example 9.1 H0: No more than 30% of the registered voters in Santa Clara County voted in the primary election. p ≤ 30 Ha: More than 30% of the registered voters in Santa Clara County voted in the primary election. p > 30 9.1 A medical trial is conducted to test whether or not a new medicine reduces cholesterol by 25%. State the null and alternative hypotheses. Example 9.2 We want to test whether the mean GPA of students in American colleges is different from 2.0 (out of 4.0). The null and alternative hypotheses are: H0: μ = 2.0 Ha: μ ≠ 2.0 9.2 We want to test whether the mean height of eighth graders is 66 inches. State the null and alternative hypotheses. Fill in the correct symbol (=, ≠, ≥, <, ≤, >) for the null and alternative hypotheses. a. H0: μ __ 66 b.

In groups, find articles from which your group can write null and alternative hypotheses. Discuss your hypotheses with the rest of the class. 9.2 | Outcomes and the Type I and Type II Errors When you perform a hypothesis test, there are four possible outcomes depending on the actual truth (or falseness) of the null hypothesis H0 and the decision to reject or not. The outcomes are summarized in the following table: ACTION H0 IS ACTUALLY ... True False Do not reject H0 Correct Outcome Type II error Reject H0 Type I Error Correct Outcome Table 9.2 The four possible outcomes in the table are: 1. The decision is not to reject H0 when H0 is true (correct decision). 2. The decision is to reject H0 when H0 is true (incorrect decision known as a Type I error). 3. The decision is not to reject H0 when, in fact, H0 is false (incorrect decision known as a Type II error). 4. The decision is to reject H0 when H0 is false (correct decision whose probability is called the Power of the Test). Each of the errors occurs with a particular probability. The Greek letters α and β represent the probabilities. α = probability of a Type I error = P(Type I error) = probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true. β = probability of a Type II error = P(Type II error) = probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false. α and β should be as small as possible because they are probabilities of errors. They are rarely zero. 508 Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 The Power of the Test is 1 – β. Ideally, we want a high power that is as close to one as possible. Increasing the sample size can increase the Power of the Test. The following are examples of Type I and Type II errors. Example 9.5 Suppose the null hypothesis, H0, is: Frank's rock climbing equipment is safe. Type I error: Frank thinks that his rock climbing equipment may not be safe when, in fact, it really is safe. Type II error: Frank thinks that his rock climbing equipment may be safe when, in fact, it is not safe. α = probability that Frank thinks his rock climbing equipment may not be safe when, in fact, it really is safe. β = probability that Frank thinks his rock climbing equipment may be safe when, in fact, it is not safe. Notice that, in this case, the error with the greater consequence is the Type II error. (If Frank thinks his rock climbing equipment is safe, he will go ahead and use it.) 9.5 Suppose the null hypothesis, H0, is: the blood cultures contain no traces of pathogen X. State the Type I and Type II errors. Example 9.6 Suppose the null hypothesis, H0, is: The victim of an automobile accident is alive when he arrives at the emergency room of a hospital. Type I error: The emergency crew thinks that the victim is dead when, in fact, the victim is alive. Type II error: The emergency crew does not know if the victim is alive when, in fact, the victim is dead. α = probability that the emergency crew thinks the victim is dead when, in fact, he is really alive = P(Type I error). β = probability that the emergency crew does not know if the victim is alive when, in fact, the victim is dead = P(Type II error). The error with the greater consequence is the Type I error. (If the emergency crew thinks the victim is dead, they will not treat him.) 9.6 Suppose the null hypothesis, H0, is: a patient is not sick. Which type of error has the greater consequence, Type I or Type II? Example 9.7 It’s a Boy Genetic Labs claim to be able to increase the likelihood that a pregnancy will result in a boy being born. Statisticians want to test the claim. Suppose that the null hypothesis, H0, is: It’s a Boy Genetic Labs has no effect on gender outcome. Type I error: This results when a true null hypothesis is rejected. In the context of this scenario, we would state that we believe that It’s a Boy Genetic Labs influences the gender outcome, when in fact it has no effect. The probability of this error occurring is denoted by the Greek letter alpha, α. Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample 509 Type II error: This results when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis. In context, we would state that It’s a Boy Genetic Labs does not influence the gender outcome of a pregnancy when, in fact, it does. The probability of this error occurring is denoted by the Greek letter beta, β. The error of greater consequence would be the Type I error since couples would use the It’s a Boy Genetic Labs product in hopes of increasing the chances of having a boy. 9.7 “Red tide” is a bloom of poison-producing algae–a few different species of a class of plankton called dinoflagellates. When the weather and water conditions cause these blooms, shellfish such as clams living in the area develop dangerous levels of a paralysis-inducing toxin. In Massachusetts, the Division of Marine Fisheries (DMF) monitors levels of the toxin in shellfish by regular sampling of shellfish along the coastline. If the mean level of toxin in clams exceeds 800 μg (micrograms) of toxin per kg of clam meat in any area, clam harvesting is banned there until the bloom is over and levels of toxin in clams subside. Describe both a Type I and a Type II error in this context, and state which error has the greater consequence. Example 9.8 A certain experimental drug claims a cure rate of at least 75% for males with prostate cancer. Describe both the Type I and Type II errors in context. Which error is the more serious? Type I: A cancer patient believes the cure rate for the drug is less than 75% when it actually is at least 75%. Type II: A cancer patient believes the experimental drug has at least a 75% cure rate when it has a cure rate that is less than 75%. In this scenario, the Type II error contains the more severe consequence. If a patient believes the drug works at least 75% of the time, this most likely will influence the patient’s (and doctor’s) choice about whether to use the drug as a treatment option. 9.8 Determine both Type I and Type II errors for the following scenario: Assume a null hypothesis, H0, that states the percentage of adults with jobs is at least 88%. Identify the Type I and Type II errors from these four statements. a. Not to reject the null hypothesis that the percentage of adults who have jobs is at least 88% when that percentage is actually less than 88% b. Not to reject the null hypothesis that the percentage of adults who have jobs is at least 88% when the percentage is actually at least 88%. c. Reject the null hypothesis that the percentage of adults who have jobs is at least 88% when the percentage is actually at least 88%. d. Reject the null hypothesis that the percentage of adults who have jobs is at least 88% when that percentage is actually less than 88%. 9.3 | Distribution Needed for Hypothesis Testing Earlier in the course, we discussed sampling distributions. Particular distributions are associated with hypothesis 510 Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 testing. Perform tests of a population mean using a normal distribution or a Student's t-distribution. (Remember, use a Student's t-distribution when the population standard deviation is unknown and the distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal.) We perform tests of a population proportion using a normal distribution (usually n is large). If you are testing a single population mean, the distribution for the test is for means: X ¯ ~ N⎛ ⎝µ X, σ X n ⎞ ⎠or td f The population parameter is μ. The estimated value (point estimate) for μ is x¯ , the sample mean. If you are testing a single population proportion, the distribution for the test is for proportions or percentages: P′ ~ N⎛ ⎝p, p ⋅ q n ⎞ ⎠ The population parameter is p. The estimated value (point estimate) for p is p′. p′ = x nwhere x is the number of successes and n is the sample size. Assumptions When you perform a hypothesis test of a single population mean μ using a Student's t-distribution (often called a t-test), there are fundamental assumptions that need to be met in order for the test to work properly. Your data should be a simple random sample that comes from a population that is approximately normally distributed. You use the sample standard deviation to approximate the population standard deviation. (Note that if the sample size is sufficiently large, a t-test will work even if the population is not approximately normally distributed). When you perform a hypothesis test of a single population mean μ using a normal distribution (often called a z-test), you take a simple random sample from the population. The population you are testing is normally distributed or your sample size is sufficiently large. You know the value of the population standard deviation which, in reality, is rarely known. When you perform a hypothesis test of a single population proportion p, you take a simple random sample from the population. You must meet the conditions for a binomial distribution which are: there are a certain number n of independent trials, the outcomes of any trial are success or failure, and each trial has the same probability of a success p. The shape of the binomial distribution needs to be similar to the shape of the normal distribution. To ensure this, the quantities np and nq must both be greater than five (np > 5 and nq > 5). Then the binomial distribution of a sample (estimated) proportion can be approximated by the normal distribution with μ = p and σ = pq n. Remember that q = 1 – p. 9.4 | Rare Events, the Sample, Decision and Conclusion Establishing the type of distribution, sample size, and known or unknown standard deviation can help you figure out how to go about a hypothesis test. However, there are several other factors you should consider when working out a hypothesis test. Rare Events Suppose you make an assumption about a property of the population (this assumption is the null hypothesis). Then you gather sample data randomly. If the sample has properties that would be very unlikely to occur if the assumption is true, then you would conclude that your assumption about the population is probably incorrect. (Remember that your assumption is just an assumption—it is not a fact and it may or may not be true. But your sample data are real and the data are showing you a fact that seems to contradict your assumption.) For example, Didi and Ali are at a birthday party of a very wealthy friend. They hurry to be first in line to grab a prize from a tall basket that they cannot see inside because they will be blindfolded. There are 200 plastic bubbles in the basket and Didi and Ali have been told that there is only one with a $100 bill. Didi is the first person to reach into the basket and pull out a bubble. Her bubble contains a $100 bill. The probability of this happening is 1 200 = 0.005. Because this is so unlikely, Ali is hoping that what the two of them were told is wrong and there are more $100 bills in the basket. A \"rare event\" has occurred (Didi getting the $100 bill) so Ali doubts the assumption about only one $100 bill being in the basket. Using the Sample to Test the Null Hypothesis Use the sample data to calculate the actual probability of getting the test result, called the p-value. The p-value is the probability that, if the null hypothesis is true, the results from another randomly selected sample will be as extreme Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample 511 or more extreme as the results obtained from the given sample. A large p-value calculated from the data indicates that we should not reject the null hypothesis. The smaller the p-value, the more unlikely the outcome, and the stronger the evidence is against the null hypothesis. We would reject the null hypothesis if the evidence is strongly against it. Draw a graph that shows the p-value. The hypothesis test is easier to perform if you use a graph because you see the problem more clearly. Example 9.9 Suppose a baker claims that his bread height is more than 15 cm, on average. Several of his customers do not believe him. To persuade his customers that he is right, the baker decides to do a hypothesis test. He bakes 10 loaves of bread. The mean height of the sample loaves is 17 cm. The baker knows from baking hundreds of loaves of bread that the standard deviation for the height is 0.5 cm. and the distribution of heights is normal. The null hypothesis could be H0: μ ≤ 15 The alternate hypothesis is Ha: μ > 15 The words \"is more than\" translates as a \">\" so \"μ > 15\" goes into the alternate hypothesis. The null hypothesis must contradict the alternate hypothesis. Since σ is known (σ = 0.5 cm.), the distribution for the population is known to be normal with mean μ = 15 and standard deviation σ n = 0.5 10 = 0.16. Suppose the null hypothesis is true (the mean height of the loaves is no more than 15 cm). Then is the mean height (17 cm) calculated from the sample unexpectedly large? The hypothesis test works by asking the question how unlikely the sample mean would be if the null hypothesis were true. The graph shows how far out the sample mean is on the normal curve. The p-value is the probability that, if we were to take other samples, any other sample mean would fall at least as far out as 17 cm. The p-value, then, is the probability that a sample mean is the same or greater than 17 cm. when the population mean is, in fact, 15 cm. We can calculate this probability using the normal distribution for means. Figure 9.2 p-value= P( x¯ > 17) which is approximately zero. A p-value of approximately zero tells us that it is highly unlikely that a loaf of bread rises no more than 15 cm, on average. That is, almost 0% of all loaves of bread would be at least as high as 17 cm. purely by CHANCE had the population mean height really been 15 cm. Because the outcome of 17 cm. is so unlikely (meaning it is happening NOT by chance alone), we conclude that the evidence is strongly against the null hypothesis (the mean height is at most 15 cm.). There is sufficient evidence that the true mean height for the population of the baker's loaves of bread is greater than 15 cm. 512 Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 9.9 A normal distribution has a standard deviation of 1. We want to verify a claim that the mean is greater than 12. A sample of 36 is taken with a sample mean of 12.5. H0: μ ≤ 12 Ha: μ > 12 The p-value is 0.0013 Draw a graph that shows the p-value. Decision and Conclusion A systematic way to make a decision of whether to reject or not reject the null hypothesis is to compare the p-value and a preset or preconceived α (also called a \"significance level\"). A preset α is the probability of a Type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true). It may or may not be given to you at the beginning of the problem. When you make a decision to reject or not reject H0, do as follows: • If α > p-value, reject H0. The results of the sample data are significant. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that H0 is an incorrect belief and that the alternative hypothesis, Ha, may be correct. • If α ≤ p-value, do not reject H0. The results of the sample data are not significant.There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the alternative hypothesis,Ha, may be correct. • When you \"do not reject H0\", it does not mean that you should believe that H0 is true. It simply means that the sample data have failed to provide sufficient evidence to cast serious doubt about the truthfulness of Ho. Conclusion: After you make your decision, write a thoughtful conclusion about the hypotheses in terms of the given problem. Example 9.10 When using the p-value to evaluate a hypothesis test, it is sometimes useful to use the following memory device If the p-value is low, the null must go. If the p-value is high, the null must fly. This memory aid relates a p-value less than the established alpha (the p is low) as rejecting the null hypothesis and, likewise, relates a p-value higher than the established alpha (the p is high) as not rejecting the null hypothesis. Fill in the blanks. Reject the null hypothesis when ______________________________________. The results of the sample data _____________________________________. Do not reject the null when hypothesis when __________________________________________. The results of the sample data ____________________________________________. Solution 9.10 Reject the null hypothesis when the p-value is less than the established alpha value. The results of the sample data support the alternative hypothesis. Do not reject the null hypothesis when the p-value is greater than the established alpha value. The results of the sample data do not support the alternative hypothesis. Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample 513 9.10 It’s a Boy Genetics Labs claim their procedures improve the chances of a boy being born. The results for a test of a single population proportion are as follows: H0: p = 0.50, Ha: p > 0.50 α = 0.01 p-value = 0.025 Interpret the results and state a conclusion in simple, non-technical terms. 9.5 | Additional Information and Full Hypothesis Test Examples • In a hypothesis test problem, you may see words such as \"the level of significance is 1%.\" The \"1%\" is the preconceived or preset α. • The statistician setting up the hypothesis test selects the value of α to use before collecting the sample data. • If no level of significance is given, a common standard to use is α = 0.05. • When you calculate the p-value and draw the picture, the p-value is the area in the left tail, the right tail, or split evenly between the two tails. For this reason, we call the hypothesis test left, right, or two tailed. • The alternative hypothesis, Ha , tells you if the test is left, right, or two-tailed. It is the key to conducting the appropriate test. • Ha never has a symbol that contains an equal sign. • Thinking about the meaning of the p-value: A data analyst (and anyone else) should have more confidence that he made the correct decision to reject the null hypothesis with a smaller p-value (for example, 0.001 as opposed to 0.04) even if using the 0.05 level for alpha. Similarly, for a large p-value such as 0.4, as opposed to a p-value of 0.056 (alpha = 0.05 is less than either number), a data analyst should have more confidence that she made the correct decision in not rejecting the null hypothesis. This makes the data analyst use judgment rather than mindlessly applying rules. The following examples illustrate a left-, right-, and two-tailed test. Example 9.11 Ho: μ = 5, Ha: μ < 5 Test of a single population mean. Ha tells you the test is left-tailed. The picture of the p-value is as follows: Figure 9.3 514 Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 9.11 H0: μ = 10, Ha: μ < 10 Assume the p-value is 0.0935. What type of test is this? Draw the picture of the p-value. Example 9.12 H0: p ≤ 0.2 Ha: p > 0.2 This is a test of a single population proportion. Ha tells you the test is right-tailed. The picture of the p-value is as follows: Figure 9.4 9.12 H0: μ ≤ 1, Ha: μ > 1 Assume the p-value is 0.1243. What type of test is this? Draw the picture of the p-value. Example 9.13 H0: p = 50 Ha: p ≠ 50 This is a test of a single population mean. Ha tells you the test is two-tailed. The picture of the p-value is as follows. Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample 515 Figure 9.5 9.13 H0: p = 0.5, Ha: p ≠ 0.5 Assume the p-value is 0.2564. What type of test is this? Draw the picture of the p-value. Full Hypothesis Test Examples Example 9.14 Jeffrey, as an eight-year old, established a mean time of 16.43 seconds for swimming the 25-yard freestyle, with a standard deviation of 0.8 seconds. His dad, Frank, thought that Jeffrey could swim the 25-yard freestyle faster using goggles. Frank bought Jeffrey a new pair of expensive goggles and timed Jeffrey for 15 25-yard freestyle swims. For the 15 swims, Jeffrey's mean time was 16 seconds. Frank thought that the goggles helped Jeffrey to swim faster than the 16.43 seconds. Conduct a hypothesis test using a preset α = 0.05. Assume that the swim times for the 25-yard freestyle are normal. Solution 9.14 Set up the Hypothesis Test: Since the problem is about a mean, this is a test of a single population mean. H0: μ = 16.43 Ha: μ < 16.43 For Jeffrey to swim faster, his time will be less than 16.43 seconds. The \"<\" tells you this is left-tailed. Determine the distribution needed: Random variable: X ¯ = the mean time to swim the 25-yard freestyle. Distribution for the test: X ¯ is normal (population standard deviation is known: σ = 0.8) X ¯ ~ N⎛ ⎝µ, σ X n ⎞ ⎠Therefore, X ¯ ~ N⎛ ⎝16.43, 0.8 15 ⎞ ⎠ μ = 16.43 comes from H0 and not the data. σ = 0.8, and n = 15. Calculate the p-value using the normal distribution for a mean: p-value = P( x¯ < 16) = 0.0187 where the sample mean in the problem is given as 16. 516 Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 p-value = 0.0187 (This is called the actual level of significance.) The p-value is the area to the left of the sample mean is given as 16. Graph: Figure 9.6 μ = 16.43 comes from H0. Our assumption is μ = 16.43. Interpretation of the p-value: If H0 is true, there is a 0.0187 probability (1.87%)that Jeffrey's mean time to swim the 25-yard freestyle is 16 seconds or less. Because a 1.87% chance is small, the mean time of 16 seconds or less is unlikely to have happened randomly. It is a rare event. Compare α and the p-value: α = 0.05 p-value = 0.0187 α > p-value Make a decision: Since α > p-value, reject H0. This means that you reject μ = 16.43. In other words, you do not think Jeffrey swims the 25-yard freestyle in 16.43 seconds but faster with the new goggles. Conclusion: At the 5% significance level, we conclude that Jeffrey swims faster using the new goggles. The sample data show there is sufficient evidence that Jeffrey's mean time to swim the 25-yard freestyle is less than 16.43 seconds. The p-value can easily be calculated.

Make sure when you use Draw that no other equations are highlighted in Y = and the plots are turned off.

The Type I and Type II errors for this problem are as follows: The Type I error is to conclude that Jeffrey swims the 25-yard freestyle, on average, in less than 16.43 seconds Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample 517 when, in fact, he actually swims the 25-yard freestyle, on average, in 16.43 seconds. (Reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true.) The Type II error is that there is not evidence to conclude that Jeffrey swims the 25-yard free-style, on average, in less than 16.43 seconds when, in fact, he actually does swim the 25-yard free-style, on average, in less than 16.43 seconds. (Do not reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.) 9.14 The mean throwing distance of a football for Marco, a high school freshman quarterback, is 40 yards, with a standard deviation of two yards. The team coach tells Marco to adjust his grip to get more distance. The coach records the distances for 20 throws. For the 20 throws, Marco’s mean distance was 45 yards. The coach thought the different grip helped Marco throw farther than 40 yards. Conduct a hypothesis test using a preset α = 0.05. Assume the throw distances for footballs are normal. First, determine what type of test this is, set up the hypothesis test, find the p-value, sketch the graph, and state your conclusion. Press STAT and arrow over to TESTS. Press 1:Z-Test. Arrow over to Stats and press ENTER. Arrow down and enter 40 for μ0 (null hypothesis), 2 for σ, 45 for the sample mean, and 20 for n. Arrow down to μ: (alternative hypothesis) and set it either as <, ≠, or >. Press ENTER. Arrow down to Calculate and press ENTER. The calculator not only calculates the p-value but it also calculates the test statistic (z-score) for the sample mean. Select <, ≠, or > for the alternative hypothesis. Do this set of instructions again except arrow to Draw (instead of Calculate). Press ENTER. A shaded graph appears with test statistic and p-value. Make sure when you use Draw that no other equations are highlighted in Y = and the plots are turned off. HISTORICAL NOTE (EXAMPLE 9.11) The traditional way to compare the two probabilities, α and the p-value, is to compare the critical value (z-score from α) to the test statistic (z-score from data). The calculated test statistic for the p-value is –2.08. (From the Central Limit Theorem, the test statistic formula is z = x¯ −µ X ( σ X n) . For this problem, x¯ = 16, μX = 16.43 from the null hypothes is, σX = 0.8, and n = 15.) You can find the critical value for α = 0.05 in the normal table (see 15.Tables in the Table of Contents). The z-score for an area to the left equal to 0.05 is midway between –1.65 and –1.64 (0.05 is midway between 0.0505 and 0.0495). The z-score is –1.645. Since –1.645 > –2.08 (which demonstrates that α > p-value), reject H0. Traditionally, the decision to reject or not reject was done in this way. Today, comparing the two probabilities α and the p-value is very common. For this problem, the p-value, 0.0187 is considerably smaller than α, 0.05. You can be confident about your decision to reject. The graph shows α, the p-value, and the test statistic and the critical value. 518 Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Figure 9.7 Example 9.15 A college football coach records the mean weight that his players can bench press as 275 pounds, with a standard deviation of 55 pounds. Three of his players thought that the mean weight was more than that amount. They asked 30 of their teammates for their estimated maximum lift on the bench press exercise. The data ranged from 205 pounds to 385 pounds. The actual different weights were (frequencies are in parentheses) 205(3); 215(3); 225(1); 241(2); 252(2); 265(2); 275(2); 313(2); 316(5); 338(2); 341(1); 345(2); 368(2); 385(1). Conduct a hypothesis test using a 2.5% level of significance to determine if the bench press mean is more than 275 pounds. Solution 9.15 Set up the Hypothesis Test: Since the problem is about a mean weight, this is a test of a single population mean. H0: μ = 275 Ha: μ > 275 This is a right-tailed test. Calculating the distribution needed: Random variable: X ¯ = the mean weight, in pounds, lifted by the football players. Distribution for the test: It is normal because σ is known. X ¯ ~ N⎛ ⎝275, 55 30 ⎞ ⎠ x¯ = 286.2pounds (from the data). σ = 55 pounds (Always use σ if you know it.) We assume μ = 275 pounds unless our data shows us otherwise. Calculate the p-value using the normal distribution for a mean and using the sample mean as input (see Appendix G for using the data as input): p-value =P(x¯ > 286.2) = 0.1323. Interpretation of the p-value: If H0 is true, then there is a 0.1331 probability (13.23%) that the football players can lift a mean weight of 286.2 pounds or more. Because a 13.23% chance is large enough, a mean weight lift of 286.2 pounds or more is not a rare event. Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample 519 Figure 9.8 Compare α and the p-value: α = 0.025 p-value = 0.1323 Make a decision: Since α <p-value, do not reject H0. Conclusion: At the 2.5% level of significance, from the sample data, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the true mean weight lifted is more than 275 pounds.

The calculator not only calculates the p-value (p = 0.1331, a little different from the previous calculation - in it we used the sample mean rounded to one decimal place instead of the data) but it also calculates the test statistic (z-score) for the sample mean, the sample mean, and the sample standard deviation. μ > 275 is the alternative hypothesis. Do this set of instructions again except arrow to Draw (instead of Calculate). Press ENTER. A shaded graph appears with z = 1.112 (test statistic) and p = 0.1331 (p-value). Make sure when you use Draw that no other equations are highlighted in Y = and the plots are turned off. Example 9.16 Statistics students believe that the mean score on the first statistics test is 65. A statistics instructor thinks the mean score is higher than 65. He samples ten statistics students and obtains the scores 65; 65; 70; 67; 66; 63; 63; 68; 72; 71. He performs a hypothesis test using a 5% level of significance. The data are assumed to be from a normal distribution. Solution 9.16 Set up the hypothesis test: A 5% level of significance means that α = 0.05. This is a test of a single population mean. H0: μ = 65 Ha: μ > 65 Since the instructor thinks the average score is higher, use a \">\". The \">\" means the test is right-tailed. Determine the distribution needed: 520 Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Random variable: X ¯ = average score on the first statistics test. Distribution for the test: If you read the problem carefully, you will notice that there is no population standard deviation given. You are only given n = 10 sample data values. Notice also that the data come from a normal distribution. This means that the distribution for the test is a student's t. Use tdf. Therefore, the distribution for the test is t9 where n = 10 and df = 10 - 1 = 9. Calculate the p-value using the Student's t-distribution: p-value = P( x¯ > 67) = 0.0396 where the sample mean and sample standard deviation are calculated as 67 and 3.1972 from the data. Interpretation of the p-value: If the null hypothesis is true, then there is a 0.0396 probability (3.96%) that the sample mean is 65 or more. Figure 9.9 Compare α and the p-value: Since α = 0.05 and p-value = 0.0396. α > p-value. Make a decision: Since α > p-value, reject H0. This means you reject μ = 65. In other words, you believe the average test score is more than 65. Conclusion: At a 5% level of significance, the sample data show sufficient evidence that the mean (average) test score is more than 65, just as the math instructor thinks. The p-value can easily be calculated. Put the data into a list. Press STAT and arrow over to TESTS. Press 2:T-Test. Arrow over to Data and press ENTER. Arrow down and enter 65 for μ0, the name of the list where you put the data, and 1 for Freq:. Arrow down to μ: and arrow over to > μ0. Press ENTER. Arrow down to Calculate and press ENTER. The calculator not only calculates the p-value (p = 0.0396) but it also calculates the test statistic (t-score) for the sample mean, the sample mean, and the sample standard deviation. μ > 65 is the alternative hypothesis. Do this set of instructions again except arrow to Draw (instead of Calculate). Press ENTER. A shaded graph appears with t = 1.9781 (test statistic) and p = 0.0396 (p-value). Make sure when you use Draw that no other equations are highlighted in Y = and the plots are turned off. Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample 521 9.16 It is believed that a stock price for a particular company will grow at a rate of $5 per week with a standard deviation of $1. An investor believes the stock won’t grow as quickly. The changes in stock price is recorded for ten weeks and are as follows: $4, $3, $2, $3, $1, $7, $2, $1, $1, $2. Perform a hypothesis test using a 5% level of significance. State the null and alternative hypotheses, find the p-value, state your conclusion, and identify the Type I and Type II errors. Example 9.17 Joon believes that 50% of first-time brides in the United States are younger than their grooms. She performs a hypothesis test to determine if the percentage is the same or different from 50%. Joon samples 100 first-time brides and 53 reply that they are younger than their grooms. For the hypothesis test, she uses a 1% level of significance. Solution 9.17 Set up the hypothesis test: The 1% level of significance means that α = 0.01. This is a test of a single population proportion. H0: p = 0.50 Ha: p ≠ 0.50 The words \"is the same or different from\" tell you this is a two-tailed test. Calculate the distribution needed: Random variable: P′ = the percent of of first-time brides who are younger than their grooms. Distribution for the test: The problem contains no mention of a mean. The information is given in terms of percentages. Use the distribution for P′, the estimated proportion. P′ ~ N⎛ ⎝p, p ⋅ q n ⎞ ⎠Therefore, P′ ~ N⎛ ⎝0.5, 0.5 ⋅ 0.5 100 ⎞ ⎠ where p = 0.50, q = 1−p = 0.50, and n = 100 Calculate the p-value using the normal distribution for proportions: p-value = P (p′ < 0.47 or p′ > 0.53) = 0.5485 where x = 53, p′ = x n = 53 100 = 0.53. Interpretation of the p-value: If the null hypothesis is true, there is 0.5485 probability (54.85%) that the sample (estimated) proportion p ' is 0.53 or more OR 0.47 or less (see the graph in Figure 9.9). Figure 9.10 μ = p = 0.50 comes from H0, the null hypothesis. 522 Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 p′ = 0.53. Since the curve is symmetrical and the test is two-tailed, the p′ for the left tail is equal to 0.50 – 0.03 = 0.47 where μ = p = 0.50. (0.03 is the difference between 0.53 and 0.50.) Compare α and the p-value: Since α = 0.01 and p-value = 0.5485. α < p-value. Make a decision: Since α < p-value, you cannot reject H0. Conclusion: At the 1% level of significance, the sample data do not show sufficient evidence that the percentage of first-time brides who are younger than their grooms is different from 50%. The p-value can easily be calculated. Press STAT and arrow over to TESTS. Press 5:1-PropZTest. Enter .5 for p0, 53 for x and 100 for n. Arrow down to Prop and arrow to not equals p0. Press ENTER. Arrow down to Calculate and press ENTER. The calculator calculates the p-value (p = 0.5485) and the test statistic (z-score). Prop not equals .5 is the alternate hypothesis. Do this set of instructions again except arrow to Draw (instead of Calculate). Press ENTER. A shaded graph appears with z = 0.6 (test statistic) and p = 0.5485 (p-value). Make sure when you use Draw that no other equations are highlighted in Y = and the plots are turned off. The Type I and Type II errors are as follows: The Type I error is to conclude that the proportion of first-time brides who are younger than their grooms is different from 50% when, in fact, the proportion is actually 50%. (Reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true). The Type II error is there is not enough evidence to conclude that the proportion of first time brides who are younger than their grooms differs from 50% when, in fact, the proportion does differ from 50%. (Do not reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.) 9.17 A teacher believes that 85% of students in the class will want to go on a field trip to the local zoo. She performs a hypothesis test to determine if the percentage is the same or different from 85%. The teacher samples 50 students and 39 reply that they would want to go to the zoo. For the hypothesis test, use a 1% level of significance. First, determine what type of test this is, set up the hypothesis test, find the p-value, sketch the graph, and state your conclusion. Example 9.18 Suppose a consumer group suspects that the proportion of households that have three cell phones is 30%. A cell phone company has reason to believe that the proportion is not 30%. Before they start a big advertising campaign, they conduct a hypothesis test. Their marketing people survey 150 households with the result that 43 of the households have three cell phones. Solution 9.18 Set up the Hypothesis Test: H0: p = 0.30 Ha: p ≠ 0.30 Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample 523 Determine the distribution needed: The random variable is P′ = proportion of households that have three cell phones. The distribution for the hypothesis test is P ' ~ N⎛ ⎝ 0.30, (0.30) ⋅ (0.70) 150 ⎞ ⎠ a. The value that helps determine the p-value is p′. Calculate p′. Solution 9.18 a. p′ = x nwhere x is the number of successes and n is the total number in the sample. x = 43, n = 150 p′ = 43 150 b. What is a success for this problem? Solution 9.18 b. A success is having three cell phones in a household. c. What is the level of significance? Solution 9.18 c. The level of significance is the preset α. Since α is not given, assume that α = 0.05. d. Draw the graph for this problem. Draw the horizontal axis. Label and shade appropriately. Calculate the p-value. Solution 9.18 d. p-value = 0.7216 e. Make a decision. _____________(Reject/Do not reject) H0 because____________. Solution 9.18 e. Assuming that α = 0.05, α < p-value. The decision is do not reject H0 because there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the proportion of households that have three cell phones is not 30%. 9.18 Marketers believe that 92% of adults in the United States own a cell phone. A cell phone manufacturer believes that number is actually lower. 200 American adults are surveyed, of which, 174 report having cell phones. Use a 5% level of significance. State the null and alternative hypothesis, find the p-value, state your conclusion, and identify the Type I and Type II errors. The next example is a poem written by a statistics student named Nicole Hart. The solution to the problem follows the poem. Notice that the hypothesis test is for a single population proportion. This means that the null and alternate hypotheses use the parameter p. The distribution for the test is normal. The estimated proportion p′ is the proportion of fleas killed to the total fleas found on Fido. This is sample information. The problem gives a preconceived α = 0.01, for comparison, and a 95% confidence interval computation. The poem is clever and humorous, so please enjoy it! 524 Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Example 9.19 My dog has so many fleas, They do not come off with ease. As for shampoo, I have tried many types Even one called Bubble Hype, Which only killed 25% of the fleas, Unfortunately I was not pleased. I've used all kinds of soap, Until I had given up hope Until one day I saw An ad that put me in awe. A shampoo used for dogs Called GOOD ENOUGH to Clean a Hog Guaranteed to kill more fleas. I gave Fido a bath And after doing the math His number of fleas Started dropping by 3's! Before his shampoo I counted 42. At the end of his bath, I redid the math And the new shampoo had killed 17 fleas. So now I was pleased. Now it is time for you to have some fun With the level of significance being .01, You must help me figure out Use the new shampoo or go without? Solution 9.19 Set up the hypothesis test: H0: p ≤ 0.25 Ha: p > 0.25 Determine the distribution needed: In words, CLEARLY state what your random variable X ¯ or P′ represents. P′ = The proportion of fleas that are killed by the new shampoo State the distribution to use for the test. Normal: N⎛ ⎝ 0.25, (0.25)(1 − 0.25) 42 ⎞ ⎠ Test Statistic: z = 2.3163 Calculate the p-value using the normal distribution for proportions: p-value = 0.0103 In one to two complete sentences, explain what the p-value means for this problem. If the null hypothesis is true (the proportion is 0.25), then there is a 0.0103 probability that the sample (estimated) proportion is 0.4048 ⎛ ⎝ 17 42 ⎞ ⎠or more. Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample 525 Use the previous information to sketch a picture of this situation. CLEARLY, label and scale the horizontal axis and shade the region(s) corresponding to the p-value. Figure 9.11 Compare α and the p-value: Indicate the correct decision (“reject” or “do not reject” the null hypothesis), the reason for it, and write an appropriate conclusion, using complete sentences. alpha decision reason for decision 0.01 Do not reject H0 α < p-value Table 9.3 Conclusion: At the 1% level of significance, the sample data do not show sufficient evidence that the percentage of fleas that are killed by the new shampoo is more than 25%. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the true mean or proportion. Include a sketch of the graph of the situation. Label the point estimate and the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval. Figure 9.12 Confidence Interval: (0.26,0.55) We are 95% confident that the true population proportion p of fleas that are 526 Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 killed by the new shampoo is between 26% and 55%. NOTE This test result is not very definitive since the p-value is very close to alpha. In reality, one would probably do more tests by giving the dog another bath after the fleas have had a chance to return. Example 9.20 The National Institute of Standards and Technology provides exact data on conductivity properties of materials. Following are conductivity measurements for 11 randomly selected pieces of a particular type of glass. 1.11; 1.07; 1.11; 1.07; 1.12; 1.08; .98; .98 1.02; .95; .95 Is there convincing evidence that the average conductivity of this type of glass is greater than one? Use a significance level of 0.05. Assume the population is normal. Solution 9.20 Let’s follow a four-step process to answer this statistical question. 1. State the Question: We need to determine if, at a 0.05 significance level, the average conductivity of the selected glass is greater than one. Our hypotheses will be a. H0: μ ≤ 1 b. Ha: μ > 1 2. Plan: We are testing a sample mean without a known population standard deviation. Therefore, we need to use a Student's-t distribution. Assume the underlying population is normal. 3. Do the calculations: We will input the sample data into the TI-83 as follows. Figure 9.13 Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample 527 Figure 9.14 Figure 9.15 Figure 9.16 4. State the Conclusions: Since the p-value* (p = 0.036) is less than our alpha value, we will reject the null hypothesis. It is reasonable to state that the data supports the claim that the average conductivity level is greater than one. Example 9.21 In a study of 420,019 cell phone users, 172 of the subjects developed brain cancer. Test the claim that cell phone users developed brain cancer at a greater rate than that for non-cell phone users (the rate of brain cancer for non-cell phone users is 0.0340%). Since this is a critical issue, use a 0.005 significance level. Explain why the significance level should be so low in terms of a Type I error. 528 Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Solution 9.21 We will follow the four-step process. 1. We need to conduct a hypothesis test on the claimed cancer rate. Our hypotheses will be a. H0: p ≤ 0.00034 b. Ha: p > 0.00034 If we commit a Type I error, we are essentially accepting a false claim. Since the claim describes cancer- causing environments, we want to minimize the chances of incorrectly identifying causes of cancer. 2. We will be testing a sample proportion with x = 172 and n = 420,019. The sample is sufficiently large because we have np = 420,019(0.00034) = 142.8, nq = 420,019(0.99966) = 419,876.2, two independent outcomes, and a fixed probability of success p = 0.00034. Thus we will be able to generalize our results to the population. 3. The associated TI results are Figure 9.17 Figure 9.18 4. Since the p-value = 0.0073 is greater than our alpha value = 0.005, we cannot reject the null. Therefore, we conclude that there is not enough evidence to support the claim of higher brain cancer rates for the cell phone users. Example 9.22 According to the US Census there are approximately 268,608,618 residents aged 12 and older. Statistics from the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network indicate that, on average, 207,754 rapes occur each year (male and female) for persons aged 12 and older. This translates into a percentage of sexual assaults of 0.078%. In Daviess County, KY, there were reported 11 rapes for a population of 37,937. Conduct an appropriate hypothesis test Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample 529 to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the local sexual assault percentage and the national sexual assault percentage. Use a significance level of 0.01. Solution 9.22 We will follow the four-step plan. 1. We need to test whether the proportion of sexual assaults in Daviess County, KY is significantly different from the national average. 2. Since we are presented with proportions, we will use a one-proportion z-test. The hypotheses for the test will be a. H0: p = 0.00078 b. Ha: p ≠ 0.00078 3. The following screen shots display the summary statistics from the hypothesis test. Figure 9.19 Figure 9.20 4. Since the p-value, p = 0.00063, is less than the alpha level of 0.01, the sample data indicates that we should reject the null hypothesis. In conclusion, the sample data support the claim that the proportion of sexual assaults in Daviess County, Kentucky is different from the national average proportion. 9.6 | Hypothesis Testing of a Single Mean and Single Proportion 530 Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 9.1 Hypothesis Testing of a Single Mean and Single Proportion Class Time: Names: Student Learning Outcomes • The student will select the appropriate distributions to use in each case. • The student will conduct hypothesis tests and interpret the results.

Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample 533 Binomial Distribution Central Limit Theorem Confidence Interval (CI) Hypothesis Hypothesis Testing Level of Significance of the Test Normal Distribution p-value Standard Deviation Student's t-Distribution Type 1 Error KEY TERMS a discrete random variable (RV) that arises from Bernoulli trials. There are a fixed number, n, of independent trials. “Independent” means that the result of any trial (for example, trial 1) does not affect the results of the following trials, and all trials are conducted under the same conditions. Under these circumstances the binomial RV Χ is defined as the number of successes in n trials. The notation is: X ~ B(n, p) μ = np and the standard deviation is σ = npq. The probability of exactly x successes in n trials is P(X =x) = ⎛ ⎝ n x ⎞ ⎠p xqn−x. Given a random variable (RV) with known mean µ and known standard deviation σ. We are sampling with size n and we are interested in two new RVs - the sample mean, X ¯ , and the sample sum, ΣX . If the size n of the sample is sufficiently large, then X ¯ ~ N⎛ ⎝µ, σ n ⎞ ⎠and ΣX ~ N(nµ, nσ). If the size n of the sample is sufficiently large, then the distribution of the sample means and the distribution of the sample sums will approximate a normal distribution regardless of the shape of the population. The mean of the sample means will equal the population mean and the mean of the sample sums will equal n times the population mean. The standard deviation of the distribution of the sample means, σ n , is called the standard error of the mean. an interval estimate for an unknown population parameter. This depends on: • The desired confidence level. • Information that is known about the distribution (for example, known standard deviation). • The sample and its size. a statement about the value of a population parameter, in case of two hypotheses, the statement assumed to be true is called the null hypothesis (notation H0) and the contradictory statement is called the alternative hypothesis (notation Ha). Based on sample evidence, a procedure for determining whether the hypothesis stated is a reasonable statement and should not be rejected, or is unreasonable and should be rejected. probability of a Type I error (reject the null hypothesis when it is true). Notation: α. In hypothesis testing, the Level of Significance is called the preconceived α or the preset α. a continuous random variable (RV) with pdf f (x) = 1 σ 2π e −(x−µ)2 2σ 2 , where μ is the mean of the distribution, and σ is the standard deviation, notation: X ~ N(μ, σ). If μ = 0 and σ = 1, the RV is called the standard normal distribution. the probability that an event will happen purely by chance assuming the null hypothesis is true. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence is against the null hypothesis. a number that is equal to the square root of the variance and measures how far data values are from their mean; notation: s for sample standard deviation and σ for population standard deviation. investigated and reported by William S. Gossett in 1908 and published under the pseudonym Student. The major characteristics of the random variable (RV) are: • It is continuous and assumes any real values. • The pdf is symmetrical about its mean of zero. However, it is more spread out and flatter at the apex than the normal distribution. • It approaches the standard normal distribution as n gets larger. • There is a \"family\" of t distributions: every representative of the family is completely defined by the number of degrees of freedom which is one less than the number of data items. The decision is to reject the null hypothesis when, in fact, the null hypothesis is true. 534 Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Type 2 Error The decision is not to reject the null hypothesis when, in fact, the null hypothesis is false. CHAPTER REVIEW 9.1 Null and Alternative Hypotheses In a hypothesis test, sample data is evaluated in order to arrive at a decision about some type of claim. If certain conditions about the sample are satisfied, then the claim can be evaluated for a population. In a hypothesis test, we: 1. Evaluate the null hypothesis, typically denoted with H0. The null is not rejected unless the hypothesis test shows otherwise. The null statement must always contain some form of equality (=, ≤ or ≥) 2. Always write the alternative hypothesis, typically denoted with Ha or H1, using less than, greater than, or not equals symbols, i.e., (≠, >, or <). 3. If we reject the null hypothesis, then we can assume there is enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis. 4. Never state that a claim is proven true or false. Keep in mind the underlying fact that hypothesis testing is based on probability laws; therefore, we can talk only in terms of non-absolute certainties. 9.2 Outcomes and the Type I and Type II Errors In every hypothesis test, the outcomes are dependent on a correct interpretation of the data. Incorrect calculations or misunderstood summary statistics can yield errors that affect the results. A Type I error occurs when a true null hypothesis is rejected. A Type II error occurs when a false null hypothesis is not rejected. The probabilities of these errors are denoted by the Greek letters α and β, for a Type I and a Type II error respectively. The power of the test, 1 – β, quantifies the likelihood that a test will yield the correct result of a true alternative hypothesis being accepted. A high power is desirable. 9.3 Distribution Needed for Hypothesis Testing In order for a hypothesis test’s results to be generalized to a population, certain requirements must be satisfied. When testing for a single population mean: 1. A Student's t-test should be used if the data come from a simple, random sample and the population is approximately normally distributed, or the sample size is large, with an unknown standard deviation. 2. The normal test will work if the data come from a simple, random sample and the population is approximately normally distributed, or the sample size is large, with a known standard deviation. When testing a single population proportion use a normal test for a single population proportion if the data comes from a simple, random sample, fill the requirements for a binomial distribution, and the mean number of success and the mean number of failures satisfy the conditions: np > 5 and nq > n where n is the sample size, p is the probability of a success, and q is the probability of a failure. 9.4 Rare Events, the Sample, Decision and Conclusion When the probability of an event occurring is low, and it happens, it is called a rare event. Rare events are important to consider in hypothesis testing because they can inform your willingness not to reject or to reject a null hypothesis. To test a null hypothesis, find the p-value for the sample data and graph the results. When deciding whether or not to reject the null the hypothesis, keep these two parameters in mind: 1. α > p-value, reject the null hypothesis 2. α ≤ p-value, do not reject the null hypothesis 9.5 Additional Information and Full Hypothesis Test Examples The hypothesis test itself has an established process. This can be summarized as follows: 1. Determine H0 and Ha. Remember, they are contradictory. 2. Determine the random variable. 3. Determine the distribution for the test. Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample 535 4. Draw a graph, calculate the test statistic, and use the test statistic to calculate the p-value. (A z-score and a t-score are examples of test statistics.) 5. Compare the preconceived α with the p-value, make a decision (reject or do not reject H0), and write a clear conclusion using English sentences. Notice that in performing the hypothesis test, you use α and not β. β is needed to help determine the sample size of the data that is used in calculating the p-value. Remember that the quantity 1 – β is called the Power of the Test. A high power is desirable. If the power is too low, statisticians typically increase the sample size while keeping α the same.If the power is low, the null hypothesis might not be rejected when it should be. FORMULA REVIEW 9.1 Null and Alternative Hypotheses H0 and Ha are contradictory. If Ho has: equal (=) greater than or equal to (≥) less than or equal to (≤) then Ha has: not equal (≠) or greater than (>) or less than (<) less than (<) greater than (>) Table 9.4 If α ≤ p-value, then do not reject H0. If α > p-value, then reject H0. α is preconceived. Its value is set before the hypothesis test starts. The p-value is calculated from the data. 9.2 Outcomes and the Type I and Type II Errors α = probability of a Type I error = P(Type I error) = probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true. β = probability of a Type II error = P(Type II error) = probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false. 9.3 Distribution Needed for Hypothesis Testing If there is no given preconceived α, then use α = 0.05. Types of Hypothesis Tests • Single population mean, known population variance (or standard deviation): Normal test. • Single population mean, unknown population variance (or standard deviation): Student's t-test. • Single population proportion: Normal test. • For a single population mean, we may use a normal distribution with the following mean and standard deviation. Means: µ =µ x¯ and σ x¯ =σ x n • A single population proportion, we may use a normal distribution with the following mean and standard deviation. Proportions: µ = p and σ = pq n.

(In general, you must first prove that assumption, however.) 74. A particular brand of tires claims that its deluxe tire averages at least 50,000 miles before it needs to be replaced. From past studies of this tire, the standard deviation is known to be 8,000. A survey of owners of that tire design is conducted. From the 28 tires surveyed, the mean lifespan was 46,500 miles with a standard deviation of 9,800 miles. Using alpha = 0.05, is the data highly inconsistent with the claim? 75. From generation to generation, the mean age when smokers first start to smoke varies. However, the standard deviation of that age remains constant of around 2.1 years.

Recently, many groups have been studying whether or not the women's movement has, in fact, resulted in an increase in the average work week for women (combining employment and at-home work). Suppose a study was done to determine if the mean work week has increased. 81 women were surveyed with the following results. The sample mean was 83; the sample standard deviation was ten. Does it appear that the mean work week has increased for women at the 5% level? 80. Your statistics instructor claims that 60 percent of the students who take her Elementary Statistics class go through life feeling more enriched. For some reason that she can't quite figure out, most people don't believe her. You decide to check this out on your own.

Suppose you don’t believe the reported figures of the percent of girls born in China. You conduct a study. In this study, you count the number of girls and boys born in 150 randomly chosen recent births. There are 60 girls and 90 boys born of the 150. Based on your study, do you believe that the percent of girls born in China is 46.7? 84. A poll done for Newsweek found that 13% of Americans have seen or sensed the presence of an angel. A contingent doubts that the percent is really that high. It conducts its own survey. Out of 76 Americans surveyed, only two had seen or sensed the presence of an angel. As a result of the contingent’s survey, would you agree with the Newsweek poll? In complete sentences, also give three reasons why the two polls might give different results.

We all get together from different towns. In my honest opinion, It's not a typical family reunion. Not forty, or fifty, or sixty, But how about seventy companions! The kids would play, scream, and shout One minute they're happy, another they'll pout. The teenagers would look, stare, and compare From how they look to what they wear. The men would chat about their business That they make more, but never less. Money is always their subject And there's always talk of more new projects. The women get tired from all of the chats They head to the kitchen to set out the mats. Some would sit and some would stand Eating and talking with plates in their hands. Then come the games and the songs And suddenly, everyone gets along! With all that laughter, it's sad to say That it always ends in the same old way. They hug and kiss and say \"good-bye\" And then they all begin to cry! I say that 60 percent shed their tears But my mom counted 35 people this year.

His competitors did not agree That freckles would increase the fee. They said, “Spots are quite nice But they don't affect price; One should breed for improved pedigree.” The breeders decided to prove This strategy was a wrong move. Breeding only for spots Would wreak havoc, they thought. His theory they want to disprove. They proposed a contest to Spreckles Comparing dog prices to freckles. In records they looked up One hundred one pups: Dalmatians that fetched the most shekels. They asked Mr. Spreckles to name An average spot count he'd claim To bring in big bucks. Said Spreckles, “Well, shucks, It's for one hundred one that I aim.” Said an amateur statistician Who wanted to help with this mission. “Twenty-one for the sample Standard deviation's ample: They examined one hundred and one Dalmatians that fetched a good sum.

So my favorite and main staple food is macaroni and cheese. It's high in taste and low in cost and nutritional value. One day, as I sat down to determine the meaning of life, I got a serious craving for this, oh, so important, food of my life. So I went down the street to Greatway to get a box of macaroni and cheese, but it was SO expensive! $2.02 !!! Can you believe it? It made me stop and think. The world is changing fast. I had thought that the mean cost of a box (the normal size, not some super-gigantic-family-value-pack) was at most $1, but now I wasn't so sure. However, I was determined to find out. I went to 53 of the closest grocery stores and surveyed the prices of macaroni and cheese. Here are the data I wrote in my notebook: Price per box of Mac and Cheese: • 5 stores @ $2.02 • 15 stores @ $0.25 • 3 stores @ $1.29 • 6 stores @ $0.35 • 4 stores @ $2.27 • 7 stores @ $1.50 • 5 stores @ $1.89 • 8 stores @ 0.75. I could see that the cost varied but I had to sit down to figure out whether or not I was right. If it does turn out that this mouth-watering dish is at most $1, then I'll throw a big cheesy party in our next statistics lab, with enough macaroni and cheese for just me. (After all, as a poor starving student I can't be expected to feed our class of animals!) Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample 549 93. \"William Shakespeare: The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark,\" by Jacqueline Ghodsi THE CHARACTERS (in order of appearance): • HAMLET, Prince of Denmark and student of Statistics • POLONIUS, Hamlet’s tutor • HOROTIO, friend to Hamlet and fellow student Scene: The great library of the castle, in which Hamlet does his lessons Act I (The day is fair, but the face of Hamlet is clouded. He paces the large room. His tutor, Polonius, is reprimanding Hamlet regarding the latter’s recent experience. Horatio is seated at the large table at right stage.) POLONIUS: My Lord, how cans’t thou admit that thou hast seen a ghost! It is but a figment of your imagination! HAMLET: I beg to differ; I know of a certainty that five-and-seventy in one hundred of us, condemned to the whips and scorns of time as we are, have gazed upon a spirit of health, or goblin damn’d, be their intents wicked or charitable. POLONIUS If thou doest insist upon thy wretched vision then let me invest your time; be true to thy work and speak to me through the reason of the null and alternate hypotheses. (He turns to Horatio.) Did not Hamlet himself say, “What piece of work is man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties? Then let not this foolishness persist. Go, Horatio, make a survey of three-and-sixty and discover what the true proportion be. For my part, I will never succumb to this fantasy, but deem man to be devoid of all reason should thy proposal of at least five-and-seventy in one hundred hold true. HORATIO (to Hamlet): What should we do, my Lord? HAMLET: Go to thy purpose, Horatio. HORATIO: To what end, my Lord? HAMLET: That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonance of our youth, but the obligation of our ever-preserved love, be even and direct with me, whether I am right or no. (Horatio exits, followed by Polonius, leaving Hamlet to ponder alone.) Act II (The next day, Hamlet awaits anxiously the presence of his friend, Horatio. Polonius enters and places some books upon the table just a moment before Horatio enters.) POLONIUS: So, Horatio, what is it thou didst reveal through thy deliberations? HORATIO: In a random survey, for which purpose thou thyself sent me forth, I did discover that one-and-forty believe fervently that the spirits of the dead walk with us. Before my God, I might not this believe, without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes. POLONIUS: Give thine own thoughts no tongue, Horatio. (Polonius turns to Hamlet.) But look to’t I charge you, my Lord. Come Horatio, let us go together, for this is not our test. (Horatio and Polonius leave together.) HAMLET: To reject, or not reject, that is the question: whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous statistics, or to take arms against a sea of data, and, by opposing, end them. (Hamlet resignedly attends to his task.) (Curtain falls) 94. \"Untitled,\" by Stephen Chen I've often wondered how software is released and sold to the public. Ironically, I work for a company that sells products with known problems. Unfortunately, most of the problems are difficult to create, which makes them difficult to fix. I usually use the test program X, which tests the product, to try to create a specific problem. When the test program is run to make an error occur, the likelihood of generating an error is 1%. So, armed with this knowledge, I wrote a new test program Y that will generate the same error that test program X creates, but more often. To find out if my test program is better than the original, so that I can convince the management that I'm right, I ran my test program to find out how often I can generate the same error. When I ran my test program 50 times, I generated the error twice. While this may not seem much better, I think that I can convince the management to use my test program instead of the original test program. Am I right? 550 Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 95. \"Japanese Girls’ Names\" by Kumi Furuichi It used to be very typical for Japanese girls’ names to end with “ko.” (The trend might have started around my grandmothers’ generation and its peak might have been around my mother’s generation.) “Ko” means “child” in Chinese characters. Parents would name their daughters with “ko” attaching to other Chinese characters which have meanings that they want their daughters to become, such as Sachiko—happy child, Yoshiko—a good child, Yasuko—a healthy child, and so on. However, I noticed recently that only two out of nine of my Japanese girlfriends at this school have names which end with “ko.” More and more, parents seem to have become creative, modernized, and, sometimes, westernized in naming their children. I have a feeling that, while 70 percent or more of my mother’s generation would have names with “ko” at the end, the proportion has dropped among my peers. I wrote down all my Japanese friends’, ex-classmates’, co-workers, and acquaintances’ names that I could remember. Following are the names. (Some are repeats.)

He asked his mother If it is okay To get his ear pierced. She said, “No way!” To poke a hole through your ear, Is not what I want for you, dear. He argued his point quite well, Says even my macho pal, Mel, Has gotten this done. It’s all just for fun. C’mon please, mom, please, what the hell. Again Phillip complained to his mother, Saying half his friends (including their brothers) Are piercing their ears And they have no fears He wants to be like the others. She said, “I think it’s much less. We must do a hypothesis test. And if you are right, I won’t put up a fight. But, if not, then my case will rest.” We proceeded to call fifty guys To see whose prediction would fly. Nineteen of the fifty Said piercing was nifty And earrings they’d occasionally buy. Then there’s the other thirty-one, Who said they’d never have this done. So now this poem’s finished. Will his hopes be diminished, Or will my nephew have his fun? 552 Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 97. \"The Craven,\" by Mark Salangsang Once upon a morning dreary In stats class I was weak and weary. Pondering over last night’s homework Whose answers were now on the board This I did and nothing more. While I nodded nearly napping Suddenly, there came a tapping. As someone gently rapping, Rapping my head as I snore. Quoth the teacher, “Sleep no more.” “In every class you fall asleep,” The teacher said, his voice was deep. “So a tally I’ve begun to keep Of every class you nap and snore. The percentage being forty-four.” “My dear teacher I must confess, While sleeping is what I do best. The percentage, I think, must be less, A percentage less than forty-four.” This I said and nothing more. “We’ll see,” he said and walked away, And fifty classes from that day He counted till the month of May The classes in which I napped and snored. The number he found was twenty-four. At a significance level of 0.05, Please tell me am I still alive? Or did my grade just take a dive Plunging down beneath the floor? Upon thee I hereby implore. 98. Toastmasters International cites a report by Gallop Poll that 40% of Americans fear public speaking. A student believes that less than 40% of students at her school fear public speaking. She randomly surveys 361 schoolmates and finds that 135 report they fear public speaking. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the percent at her school is less than 40%. 99. Sixty-eight percent of online courses taught at community colleges nationwide were taught by full-time faculty. To test if 68% also represents California’s percent for full-time faculty teaching the online classes, Long Beach City College (LBCC) in California, was randomly selected for comparison. In the same year, 34 of the 44 online courses LBCC offered were taught by full-time faculty. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if 68% represents California. NOTE: For more accurate results, use more California community colleges and this past year's data. 100. According to an article in Bloomberg Businessweek, New York City's most recent adult smoking rate is 14%. Suppose that a survey is conducted to determine this year’s rate. Nine out of 70 randomly chosen N.Y. City residents reply that they smoke. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the rate is still 14% or if it has decreased. Chapter 9 | Hypothesis Testing with One Sample 553 101. The mean age of De Anza College students in a previous term was 26.6 years old. An instructor thinks the mean age for online students is older than 26.6. She randomly surveys 56 online students and finds that the sample mean is 29.4 with a standard deviation of 2.1. Conduct a hypothesis test. 102. Registered nurses earned an average annual salary of $69,110. For that same year, a survey was conducted of 41 California registered nurses to determine if the annual salary is higher than $69,110 for California nurses. The sample average was $71,121 with a sample standard deviation of $7,489. Conduct a hypothesis test. 103. La Leche League International reports that the mean age of weaning a child from breastfeeding is age four to five worldwide. In America, most nursing mothers wean their children much earlier. Suppose a random survey is conducted of 21 U.S. mothers who recently weaned their children. The mean weaning age was nine months (3/4 year) with a standard deviation of 4 months. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the mean weaning age in the U.S. is less than four years old. 104. Over the past few decades, public health officials have examined the link between weight concerns and teen girls' smoking. Researchers surveyed a group of 273 randomly selected teen girls living in Massachusetts (between 12 and 15 years old). After four years the girls were surveyed again. Sixty-three said they smoked to stay thin. Is there good evidence that more than thirty percent of the teen girls smoke to stay thin? After conducting the test, your decision and conclusion are a. Reject H0: There is sufficient evidence to conclude that more than 30% of teen girls smoke to stay thin. b. Do not reject H0: There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that less than 30% of teen girls smoke to stay thin. c. Do not reject H0: There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that more than 30% of teen girls smoke to stay thin. d.

A statistics instructor believes that fewer than 20% of Evergreen Valley College (EVC) students attended the opening night midnight showing of the latest Harry Potter movie. She surveys 84 of her students and finds that 11 of them attended the midnight showing. At a 1% level of significance, an appropriate conclusion is: a. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the percent of EVC students who attended the midnight showing of Harry Potter is less than 20%. b. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the percent of EVC students who attended the midnight showing of Harry Potter is more than 20%. c.

According to the Center for Disease Control website, in 2011 at least 18% of high school students have smoked a cigarette. An Introduction to Statistics class in Davies County, KY conducted a hypothesis test at the local high school (a medium sized–approximately 1,200 students–small city demographic) to determine if the local high school’s percentage was lower. One hundred fifty students were chosen at random and surveyed. Of the 150 students surveyed, 82 have smoked. Use a significance level of 0.05 and using appropriate statistical evidence, conduct a hypothesis test and state the conclusions. 108. A recent survey in the N.Y. Times Almanac indicated that 48.8% of families own stock. A broker wanted to determine if this survey could be valid. He surveyed a random sample of 250 families and found that 142 owned some type of stock. At the 0.05 significance level, can the survey be considered to be accurate? 109. Driver error can be listed as the cause of approximately 54% of all fatal auto accidents, according to the American Automobile Association. Thirty randomly selected fatal accidents are examined, and it is determined that 14 were caused by driver error. Using α = 0.05, is the AAA proportion accurate? 110. The US Department of Energy reported that 51.7% of homes were heated by natural gas. A random sample of 221 homes in Kentucky found that 115 were heated by natural gas. Does the evidence support the claim for Kentucky at the α = 0.05 level in Kentucky? Are the results applicable across the country? Why? 111. For Americans using library services, the American Library Association claims that at most 67% of patrons borrow books. The library director in Owensboro, Kentucky feels this is not true, so she asked a local college statistic class to conduct a survey. The class randomly selected 100 patrons and found that 82 borrowed books. Did the class demonstrate that the percentage was higher in Owensboro, KY? Use α = 0.01 level of significance. What is the possible proportion of patrons that do borrow books from the Owensboro Library? 112. The Weather Underground reported that the mean amount of summer rainfall for the northeastern US is at least 11.52 inches. Ten cities in the northeast are randomly selected and the mean rainfall amount is calculated to be 7.42 inches with a standard deviation of 1.3 inches. At the α = 0.05 level, can it be concluded that the mean rainfall was below the reported average? What if α = 0.01? Assume the amount of summer rainfall follows a normal distribution. 113. A survey in the N.Y. Times Almanac finds the mean commute time (one way) is 25.4 minutes for the 15 largest US cities. The Austin, TX chamber of commerce feels that Austin’s commute time is less and wants to publicize this fact. The mean for 25 randomly selected commuters is 22.1 minutes with a standard deviation of 5.3 minutes. At the α = 0.10 level, is the Austin, TX commute significantly less than the mean commute time for the 15 largest US cities? 114. A report by the Gallup Poll found that a woman visits her doctor, on average, at most 5.8 times each year.

According to the N.Y. Times Almanac the mean family size in the U.S. is 3.18. A sample of a college math class resulted in the following family sizes: 5; 4; 5; 4; 4; 3; 6; 4; 3; 3; 5; 5; 6; 3; 3; 2; 7; 4; 5; 2; 2; 2; 3; 2 At α = 0.05 level, is the class’ mean family size greater than the national average? Does the Almanac result remain valid? Why? 116. The student academic group on a college campus claims that freshman students study at least 2.5 hours per day, on average. One Introduction to Statistics class was skeptical. The class took a random sample of 30 freshman students and found a mean study time of 137 minutes with a standard deviation of 45 minutes. At α = 0.01 level, is the student academic group’s claim correct? REFERENCES 9.1 Null and Alternative Hypotheses Data from the National Institute of Mental Health.

(credit: Chloe Lim) Introduction Chapter Objectives By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: • Classify hypothesis tests by type. • Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests for two population means, population standard deviations known. • Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests for two population means, population standard deviations unknown. • Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests for two population proportions. • Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests for matched or paired samples. Studies often compare two groups. For example, researchers are interested in the effect aspirin has in preventing heart Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples 567 attacks. Over the last few years, newspapers and magazines have reported various aspirin studies involving two groups. Typically, one group is given aspirin and the other group is given a placebo. Then, the heart attack rate is studied over several years. There are other situations that deal with the comparison of two groups. For example, studies compare various diet and exercise programs. Politicians compare the proportion of individuals from different income brackets who might vote for them. Students are interested in whether SAT or GRE preparatory courses really help raise their scores. You have learned to conduct hypothesis tests on single means and single proportions. You will expand upon that in this chapter. You will compare two means or two proportions to each other. The general procedure is still the same, just expanded. To compare two means or two proportions, you work with two groups. The groups are classified either as independent or matched pairs. Independent groups consist of two samples that are independent, that is, sample values selected from one population are not related in any way to sample values selected from the other population. Matched pairs consist of two samples that are dependent. The parameter tested using matched pairs is the population mean. The parameters tested using independent groups are either population means or population proportions. NOTE This chapter relies on either a calculator or a computer to calculate the degrees of freedom, the test statistics, and p-values. TI-83+ and TI-84 instructions are included as well as the test statistic formulas. When using a TI-83+ or TI-84 calculator, we do not need to separate two population means, independent groups, or population variances unknown into large and small sample sizes. However, most statistical computer software has the ability to differentiate these tests. This chapter deals with the following hypothesis tests: Independent groups (samples are independent) • Test of two population means. • Test of two population proportions. Matched or paired samples (samples are dependent) • Test of the two population proportions by testing one population mean of differences. 10.1 | Two Population Means with Unknown Standard Deviations 1. The two independent samples are simple random samples from two distinct populations. 2. For the two distinct populations: ◦ if the sample sizes are small, the distributions are important (should be normal) ◦ if the sample sizes are large, the distributions are not important (need not be normal) The test comparing two independent population means with unknown and possibly unequal population standard deviations is called the Aspin-Welch t-test. The degrees of freedom formula was developed by Aspin-Welch. The comparison of two population means is very common. A difference between the two samples depends on both the means and the standard deviations. Very different means can occur by chance if there is great variation among the individual samples. In order to account for the variation, we take the difference of the sample means, X ¯ 1– X ¯ 2, and divide by the standard error in order to standardize the difference. The result is a t-score test statistic. Because we do not know the population standard deviations, we estimate them using the two sample standard deviations from our independent samples. For the hypothesis test, we calculate the estimated standard deviation, or standard error, of the difference in sample means, X ¯ 1– X ¯ 2. 568 Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 The standard error is: (s1) 2 n1 + (s2) 2 n2 The test statistic (t-score) is calculated as follows: (x¯ 1–x¯ 2) – (µ 1–µ 2) (s1)2 n1 + (s2)2 n2 where: • s1 and s2, the sample standard deviations, are estimates of σ1 and σ2, respectively. • σ1 and σ1 are the unknown population standard deviations. • x¯ 1and x¯ 2are the sample means. μ1 and μ2 are the population means. The number of degrees of freedom (df) requires a somewhat complicated calculation. However, a computer or calculator calculates it easily. The df are not always a whole number. The test statistic calculated previously is approximated by the Student's t-distribution with df as follows: Degrees of freedom d f = ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ (s1)2 n1 + (s2)2 n2 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ 2 ⎛ ⎝ 1 n1– 1 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ (s1)2 n1 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ 2 + ⎛ ⎝ 1 n2– 1 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ (s2)2 n2 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ 2 When both sample sizes n1 and n2 are five or larger, the Student's t approximation is very good. Notice that the sample variances (s1)2 and (s2)2 are not pooled. (If the question comes up, do not pool the variances.) It is not necessary to compute this by hand. A calculator or computer easily computes it. Example 10.1 Independent groups The average amount of time boys and girls aged seven to 11 spend playing sports each day is believed to be the same. A study is done and data are collected, resulting in the data in Table 10.1. Each populations has a normal distribution. Sample Size Average Number of Hours Playing Sports Per Day Sample Standard Deviation Girls 9 2 0.866 Boys 16 3.2 1.00 Table 10.1 Is there a difference in the mean amount of time boys and girls aged seven to 11 play sports each day? Test at the 5% level of significance. Solution 10.1 The population standard deviations are not known. Let g be the subscript for girls and b be the subscript for boys. Then, μg is the population mean for girls and μb is the population mean for boys. This is a test of two independent groups, two population means. Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples 569 Random variable: X ¯ g−X ¯ b = difference in the sample mean amount of time girls and boys play sports each day. H0: μg = μb H0: μg – μb = 0 Ha: μg ≠ μb Ha: μg – μb ≠ 0 The words \"the same\" tell you H0 has an \"=\". Since there are no other words to indicate Ha, assume it says \"is different.\" This is a two-tailed test. Distribution for the test: Use tdf where df is calculated using the df formula for independent groups, two population means. Using a calculator, df is approximately 18.8462. Do not pool the variances. Calculate the p-value using a Student's t-distribution: p-value = 0.0054 Graph: Figure 10.2 sg= 0.866 sb = 1 So, x¯ g–x¯ b = 2 – 3.2 = –1.2 Half the p-value is below –1.2 and half is above 1.2. Make a decision: Since α > p-value, reject H0. This means you reject μg = μb. The means are different. Press STAT. Arrow over to TESTS and press 4:2-SampTTest. Arrow over to Stats and press ENTER.

Conclusion: At the 5% level of significance, the sample data show there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean number of hours that girls and boys aged seven to 11 play sports per day is different (mean number of hours boys aged seven to 11 play sports per day is greater than the mean number of hours played by girls OR the mean number of hours girls aged seven to 11 play sports per day is greater than the mean number of hours played by boys). 570 Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 10.1 Two samples are shown in Table 10.2.

Cohen's Standards for Small, Medium, and Large Effect Sizes Cohen's d is a measure of effect size based on the differences between two means. Cohen’s d, named for United States statistician Jacob Cohen, measures the relative strength of the differences between the means of two populations based on sample data. The calculated value of effect size is then compared to Cohen’s standards of small, medium, and large effect sizes. 574 Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Size of effect d Small 0.2 medium 0.5 Large 0.8 Table 10.5 Cohen's Standard Effect Sizes Cohen's d is the measure of the difference between two means divided by the pooled standard deviation: d = x¯ 1–x¯ 2 spooled where spooled = (n1– 1)s1 2+ (n2– 1)s2 2 n1+ n2– 2 Example 10.4 Calculate Cohen’s d for Example 10.2. Is the size of the effect small, medium, or large? Explain what the size of the effect means for this problem. Solution 10.4 μ1 = 4 s1 = 1.5 n1 = 11 μ2 = 3.5 s2 = 1 n2 = 9 d = 0.384 The effect is small because 0.384 is between Cohen’s value of 0.2 for small effect size and 0.5 for medium effect size. The size of the differences of the means for the two colleges is small indicating that there is not a significant difference between them. Example 10.5 Calculate Cohen’s d for Example 10.3. Is the size of the effect small, medium or large? Explain what the size of the effect means for this problem. Solution 10.5 d = 0.834; Large, because 0.834 is greater than Cohen’s 0.8 for a large effect size. The size of the differences between the means of the Final Exam scores of online students and students in a face-to-face class is large indicating a significant difference.

A high positive weighted alpha signifies a stock whose price has risen while a small positive weighted alpha indicates an unchanged stock price during the time period. Weighted alpha is used to identify companies with strong upward or downward trends. The weighted alpha for the top 30 stocks of banks in the northeast and in the west as identified by Nasdaq on May 24, 2013 are listed in Table 10.6 and Table 10.7, respectively. 94.2 75.2 69.6 52.0 48.0 41.9 36.4 33.4 31.5 27.6 77.3 71.9 67.5 50.6 46.2 38.4 35.2 33.0 28.7 26.5 76.3 71.7 56.3 48.7 43.2 37.6 33.7 31.8 28.5 26.0 Table 10.6 Northeast 126.0 70.6 65.2 51.4 45.5 37.0 33.0 29.6 23.7 22.6 116.1 70.6 58.2 51.2 43.2 36.0 31.4 28.7 23.5 21.6 78.2 68.2 55.6 50.3 39.0 34.1 31.0 25.3 23.4 21.5 Table 10.7 West Is there a difference in the weighted alpha of the top 30 stocks of banks in the northeast and in the west?

Calculate Cohen’s d and interpret it. 10.2 | Two Population Means with Known Standard Deviations Even though this situation is not likely (knowing the population standard deviations is not likely), the following example illustrates hypothesis testing for independent means, known population standard deviations. The sampling distribution for the difference between the means is normal and both populations must be normal. The random variable is X1–X2. The normal distribution has the following format: Normal distribution is: X ¯ 1–X ¯ 2~ N⎡ ⎣ ⎢µ 1–µ 2, (σ1) 2 n1 + (σ2) 2 n2 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ 576 Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 The standard deviation is: (σ1) 2 n1 + (σ2) 2 n2 The test statistic (z-score) is: z =(x¯ 1–x¯ 2) – (µ 1–µ 2) (σ1)2 n1 + (σ2)2 n2 Example 10.6 Independent groups, population standard deviations known: The mean lasting time of two competing floor waxes is to be compared. Twenty floors are randomly assigned to test each wax. Both populations have a normal distributions. The data are recorded in Table 10.8. Wax Sample Mean Number of Months Floor Wax Lasts Population Standard Deviation 1 3 0.33 2 2.9 0.36 Table 10.8 Does the data indicate that wax 1 is more effective than wax 2? Test at a 5% level of significance. Solution 10.6 This is a test of two independent groups, two population means, population standard deviations known. Random Variable: X ¯ 1– X ¯ 2= difference in the mean number of months the competing floor waxes last. H0: μ1 ≤ μ2 Ha: μ1 > μ2 The words \"is more effective\" says that wax 1 lasts longer than wax 2, on average. \"Longer\" is a “>” symbol and goes into Ha. Therefore, this is a right-tailed test. Distribution for the test: The population standard deviations are known so the distribution is normal. Using the formula, the distribution is: X ¯ 1–X ¯ 2~ N⎛ ⎝ 0, 0.33 2 20 + 0.36 2 20 ⎞ ⎠ Since μ1 ≤ μ2 then μ1 – μ2 ≤ 0 and the mean for the normal distribution is zero. Calculate the p-value using the normal distribution: p-value = 0.1799 Graph: Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples 577 Figure 10.5 X ¯ 1– X ¯ 2= 3 – 2.9 = 0.1 Compare α and the p-value: α = 0.05 and p-value = 0.1799. Therefore, α < p-value. Make a decision: Since α < p-value, do not reject H0. Conclusion: At the 5% level of significance, from the sample data, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean time wax 1 lasts is longer (wax 1 is more effective) than the mean time wax 2 lasts.

Thirty engines are randomly assigned to be tested. Both populations have normal distributions. Table 10.9 shows the result. Do the data indicate that Engine 2 has higher RPM than Engine 1? Test at a 5% level of significance. Engine Sample Mean Number of RPM Population Standard Deviation 1 1,500 50 2 1,600 60 Table 10.9 Example 10.7 An interested citizen wanted to know if Democratic U. S. senators are older than Republican U.S. senators, on 578 Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 average. On May 26 2013, the mean age of 30 randomly selected Republican Senators was 61 years 247 days old (61.675 years) with a standard deviation of 10.17 years. The mean age of 30 randomly selected Democratic senators was 61 years 257 days old (61.704 years) with a standard deviation of 9.55 years. Do the data indicate that Democratic senators are older than Republican senators, on average? Test at a 5% level of significance. Solution 10.7 This is a test of two independent groups, two population means. The population standard deviations are unknown, but the sum of the sample sizes is 30 + 30 = 60, which is greater than 30, so we can use the normal approximation to the Student’s-t distribution. Subscripts: 1: Democratic senators 2: Republican senators Random variable: X ¯ 1 – X ¯ 2= difference in the mean age of Democratic and Republican U.S. senators. H0: µ1 ≤ µ2 H0: µ1 – µ2 ≤ 0 Ha: µ1 > µ2 Ha: µ1 – µ2 > 0 The words \"older than\" translates as a “>” symbol and goes into Ha. Therefore, this is a right-tailed test. Distribution for the test: The distribution is the normal approximation to the Student’s t for means, independent groups. Using the formula, the distribution is: X ¯ 1–X ¯ 2∼N[0, (9.55) 2 30 + (10.17) 2 30 ] Since µ1 ≤ µ2, µ1 – µ2 ≤ 0 and the mean for the normal distribution is zero. (Calculating the p-value using the normal distribution gives p-value = 0.4955) Graph: Figure 10.6 Compare α and the p-value: α = 0.05 and p-value = 0.4955. Therefore, α < p-value. Make a decision: Since α < p-value, do not reject H0. Conclusion: At the 5% level of significance, from the sample data, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean age of Democratic senators is greater than the mean age of the Republican senators. 10.3 | Comparing Two Independent Population Proportions When conducting a hypothesis test that compares two independent population proportions, the following characteristics should be present: 1. The two independent samples are simple random samples that are independent. 2. The number of successes is at least five, and the number of failures is at least five, for each of the samples. 3. Growing literature states that the population must be at least ten or 20 times the size of the sample. This keeps each population from being over-sampled and causing incorrect results. Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples 579 Comparing two proportions, like comparing two means, is common. If two estimated proportions are different, it may be due to a difference in the populations or it may be due to chance. A hypothesis test can help determine if a difference in the estimated proportions reflects a difference in the population proportions. The difference of two proportions follows an approximate normal distribution. Generally, the null hypothesis states that the two proportions are the same. That is, H0: pA = pB. To conduct the test, we use a pooled proportion, pc. The pooled proportion is calculated as follows: pc =xA+ xB nA+ nB The distribution for the differences is: P′ A−P′B~ N[0, pc(1 −pc)(1 nA + 1 nB )] The test statistic (z-score) is: z =(p′ A−p′B) − (p A−pB) pc(1 −pc)(1 nA + 1 nB ) Example 10.8 Two types of medication for hives are being tested to determine if there is a difference in the proportions of adult patient reactions. Twenty out of a random sample of 200 adults given medication A still had hives 30 minutes after taking the medication. Twelve out of another random sample of 200 adults given medication B still had hives 30 minutes after taking the medication. Test at a 1% level of significance. Solution 10.8 The problem asks for a difference in proportions, making it a test of two proportions. Let A and B be the subscripts for medication A and medication B, respectively. Then pA and pB are the desired population proportions. Random Variable: P′A – P′B = difference in the proportions of adult patients who did not react after 30 minutes to medication A and to medication B. H0: pA = pB pA – pB = 0 Ha: pA ≠ pB pA – pB ≠ 0 The words \"is a difference\" tell you the test is two-tailed. Distribution for the test: Since this is a test of two binomial population proportions, the distribution is normal: pc =xA+ xB nA+ nB= 20 + 12 200 + 200 = 0.08 1 –pc = 0.92 P′ A–P′B~ N⎡ ⎣0, (0.08)(0.92)(1 200 + 1 200 ) ⎤ ⎦ P′A – P′B follows an approximate normal distribution. Calculate the p-value using the normal distribution: p-value = 0.1404. Estimated proportion for group A: p′ A=xA nA= 20 200 = 0.1 Estimated proportion for group B: p′B=xB nB= 12 200 = 0.06 580 Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Graph: Figure 10.7 P′A – P′B = 0.1 – 0.06 = 0.04. Half the p-value is below –0.04, and half is above 0.04. Compare α and the p-value: α = 0.01 and the p-value = 0.1404. α < p-value. Make a decision: Since α < p-value, do not reject H0. Conclusion: At a 1% level of significance, from the sample data, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a difference in the proportions of adult patients who did not react after 30 minutes to medication A and medication B.

Example 10.9 A research study was conducted about gender differences in “sexting.” The researcher believed that the proportion of girls involved in “sexting” is less than the proportion of boys involved.

Is the proportion of girls sending sexts less than the proportion of boys “sexting?” Test at a 1% level of significance. Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples 581 Males Females Sent “sexts” 183 156 Total number surveyed 2231 2169 Table 10.10 Solution 10.9 This is a test of two population proportions. Let M and F be the subscripts for males and females. Then pM and pF are the desired population proportions. Random variable: p′F − p′M = difference in the proportions of males and females who sent “sexts.” H0: pF = pM H0: pF – pM = 0 Ha: pF < pM Ha: pF – pM < 0 The words \"less than\" tell you the test is left-tailed. Distribution for the test: Since this is a test of two population proportions, the distribution is normal: pc =xF+ xM nF+ nM = 156 + 183 2169 + 2231 = 0.077 1 −pc = 0.923 Therefore, p′F–p′ M ∼N⎛ ⎝0, (0.077)(0.923) ⎛ ⎝ 1 2169 + 1 2231 ⎞ ⎠ ⎞ ⎠ p′F – p′M follows an approximate normal distribution.

A cell phone company claimed that iPhone smartphones are more popular with whites (non-Hispanic) than with African Americans. The results of the survey indicate that of the 232 African American cell phone owners randomly sampled, 5% have an iPhone. Of the 1,343 white cell phone owners randomly sampled, 10% own an iPhone. Test at the 5% level of significance. Is the proportion of white iPhone owners greater than the proportion of African American iPhone owners? Solution 10.10 This is a test of two population proportions. Let W and A be the subscripts for the whites and African Americans. Then pW and pA are the desired population proportions. Random variable: p′W – p′A = difference in the proportions of Android and iPhone users. H0: pW = pA H0: pW – pA = 0 Ha: pW > pA Ha: pW – pA > 0 The words \"more popular\" indicate that the test is right-tailed. Distribution for the test: The distribution is approximately normal: pc =xW + xA nW + nA= 134 + 12 1343 + 232 = 0.0927 1 −pc = 0.9073 Therefore, p′W –p′ A∽N⎛ ⎝0, (0.0927)(0.9073) ⎛ ⎝ 1 1343 + 1 232 ⎞ ⎠ ⎞ ⎠ p′W –p′ A follows an approximate normal distribution.

Simple random sampling is used. 584 Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 2. Sample sizes are often small. 3. Two measurements (samples) are drawn from the same pair of individuals or objects. 4. Differences are calculated from the matched or paired samples. 5. The differences form the sample that is used for the hypothesis test. 6. Either the matched pairs have differences that come from a population that is normal or the number of differences is sufficiently large so that distribution of the sample mean of differences is approximately normal. In a hypothesis test for matched or paired samples, subjects are matched in pairs and differences are calculated. The differences are the data. The population mean for the differences, μd, is then tested using a Student's-t test for a single population mean with n – 1 degrees of freedom, where n is the number of differences. The test statistic (t-score) is: t = x¯ d −µ d ⎛ ⎝ sd n ⎞ ⎠ Example 10.11 A study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of hypnotism in reducing pain. Results for randomly selected subjects are shown in Table 10.10. A lower score indicates less pain. The \"before\" value is matched to an \"after\" value and the differences are calculated. The differences have a normal distribution. Are the sensory measurements, on average, lower after hypnotism? Test at a 5% significance level.

Let µ d be the population mean for the differences. We use the subscript d to denote \"differences.\" Random variable: X ¯ d = the mean difference of the sensory measurements H0: μd ≥ 0 The null hypothesis is zero or positive, meaning that there is the same or more pain felt after hypnotism. That means the subject shows no improvement. μd is the population mean of the differences.) Ha: μd < 0 The alternative hypothesis is negative, meaning there is less pain felt after hypnotism. That means the subject shows improvement. The score should be lower after hypnotism, so the difference ought to be negative to indicate improvement. Distribution for the test: The distribution is a Student's t with df = n – 1 = 8 – 1 = 7. Use t7. (Notice that the test is for a single population mean.) Calculate the p-value using the Student's-t distribution: p-value = 0.0095 Graph: Figure 10.10 X ¯ d is the random variable for the differences. The sample mean and sample standard deviation of the differences are: x¯ d = –3.13 s¯ d = 2.91 Compare α and the p-value: α = 0.05 and p-value = 0.0095. α > p-value. Make a decision: Since α > p-value, reject H0. This means that μd < 0 and there is improvement. Conclusion: At a 5% level of significance, from the sample data, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the sensory measurements, on average, are lower after hypnotism. Hypnotism appears to be effective in reducing pain. NOTE For the TI-83+ and TI-84 calculators, you can either calculate the differences ahead of time (after - before) and put the differences into a list or you can put the after data into a first list and the before data into a second list.

He asked four of his players to participate in a study. The amount of weight they could each lift was recorded before they took the strength development class. After completing the class, the amount of weight they could each lift was again measured. The data are as follows: Weight (in pounds) Player 1 Player 2 Player 3 Player 4 Amount of weight lifted prior to the class 205 241 338 368 Amount of weight lifted after the class 295 252 330 360 Table 10.14 The coach wants to know if the strength development class makes his players stronger, on average. Record the differences data. Calculate the differences by subtracting the amount of weight lifted prior to the class from the weight lifted after completing the class.

Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples 593 Degrees of Freedom (df) Pooled Proportion Standard Deviation Variable (Random Variable) KEY TERMS the number of objects in a sample that are free to vary. estimate of the common value of p1 and p2. A number that is equal to the square root of the variance and measures how far data values are from their mean; notation: s for sample standard deviation and σ for population standard deviation. a characteristic of interest in a population being studied. Common notation for variables are upper-case Latin letters X, Y, Z,... Common notation for a specific value from the domain (set of all possible values of a variable) are lower-case Latin letters x, y, z,.... For example, if X is the number of children in a family, then x represents a specific integer 0, 1, 2, 3, .... Variables in statistics differ from variables in intermediate algebra in two following ways. • The domain of the random variable (RV) is not necessarily a numerical set; the domain may be expressed in words; for example, if X = hair color, then the domain is {black, blond, gray, green, orange}. • We can tell what specific value x of the random variable X takes only after performing the experiment.

Parents of teenage boys often complain that auto insurance costs more, on average, for teenage boys than for teenage girls. A group of concerned parents examines a random sample of insurance bills. The mean annual cost for 36 teenage boys was $679. For 23 teenage girls, it was $559. From past years, it is known that the population standard deviation for each group is $180. Determine whether or not you believe that the mean cost for auto insurance for teenage boys is greater than that for teenage girls. 95. A group of transfer bound students wondered if they will spend the same mean amount on texts and supplies each year at their four-year university as they have at their community college.

A recent drug survey showed an increase in the use of drugs and alcohol among local high school seniors as compared to the national percent. Suppose that a survey of 100 local seniors and 100 national seniors is conducted to see if the proportion of drug and alcohol use is higher locally than nationally. Locally, 65 seniors reported using drugs or alcohol within the past month, while 60 national seniors reported using them. 100. We are interested in whether the proportions of female suicide victims for ages 15 to 24 are the same for the whites and the blacks races in the United States. We randomly pick one year, 1992, to compare the races. The number of suicides estimated in the United States in 1992 for white females is 4,930. Five hundred eighty were aged 15 to 24. The estimate for black females is 330. Forty were aged 15 to 24. We will let female suicide victims be our population. 101. Elizabeth Mjelde, an art history professor, was interested in whether the value from the Golden Ratio formula, ⎛ ⎝ larger + smaller dimension larger dimension ⎞ ⎠ was the same in the Whitney Exhibit for works from 1900 to 1919 as for works from 1920 to 1942. Thirty-seven early works were sampled, averaging 1.74 with a standard deviation of 0.11. Sixty-five of the later works were sampled, averaging 1.746 with a standard deviation of 0.1064. Do you think that there is a significant difference in the Golden Ratio calculation? 102. A recent year was randomly picked from 1985 to the present. In that year, there were 2,051 Hispanic students at Cabrillo College out of a total of 12,328 students. At Lake Tahoe College, there were 321 Hispanic students out of a total of 2,441 students. In general, do you think that the percent of Hispanic students at the two colleges is basically the same or different? Use the following information to answer the next three exercises. Neuroinvasive West Nile virus is a severe disease that affects a person’s nervous system . It is spread by the Culex species of mosquito. In the United States in 2010 there were 629 reported cases of neuroinvasive West Nile virus out of a total of 1,021 reported cases and there were 486 neuroinvasive reported cases out of a total of 712 cases reported in 2011. Is the 2011 proportion of neuroinvasive West Nile virus cases more than the 2010 proportion of neuroinvasive West Nile virus cases? Using a 1% level of significance, conduct an appropriate hypothesis test. • “2011” subscript: 2011 group. • “2010” subscript: 2010 group 103. This is: a. a test of two proportions b. a test of two independent means c. a test of a single mean d. a test of matched pairs. 104. An appropriate null hypothesis is: a. p2011 ≤ p2010 b. p2011 ≥ p2010 c. μ2011 ≤ μ2010 d. p2011 > p2010 604 Chapter 10 | Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 105. The p-value is 0.0022. At a 1% level of significance, the appropriate conclusion is a. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the proportion of people in the United States in 2011 who contracted neuroinvasive West Nile disease is less than the proportion of people in the United States in 2010 who contracted neuroinvasive West Nile disease. b. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the proportion of people in the United States in 2011 who contracted neuroinvasive West Nile disease is more than the proportion of people in the United States in 2010 who contracted neuroinvasive West Nile disease. c.

Joan Nguyen recently claimed that the proportion of college-age males with at least one pierced ear is as high as the proportion of college-age females. She conducted a survey in her classes. Out of 107 males, 20 had at least one pierced ear. Out of 92 females, 47 had at least one pierced ear. Do you believe that the proportion of males has reached the proportion of females? 113. Use the data sets found in Appendix C to answer this exercise. Is the proportion of race laps Terri completes slower than 130 seconds less than the proportion of practice laps she completes slower than 135 seconds? 114. \"To Breakfast or Not to Breakfast?\" by Richard Ayore In the American society, birthdays are one of those days that everyone looks forward to. People of different ages and peer groups gather to mark the 18th, 20th, …, birthdays. During this time, one looks back to see what he or she has achieved for the past year and also focuses ahead for more to come. If, by any chance, I am invited to one of these parties, my experience is always different. Instead of dancing around with my friends while the music is booming, I get carried away by memories of my family back home in Kenya. I remember the good times I had with my brothers and sister while we did our daily routine. Every morning, I remember we went to the shamba (garden) to weed our crops. I remember one day arguing with my brother as to why he always remained behind just to join us an hour later. In his defense, he said that he preferred waiting for breakfast before he came to weed. He said, “This is why I always work more hours than you guys!” And so, to prove him wrong or right, we decided to give it a try. One day we went to work as usual without breakfast, and recorded the time we could work before getting tired and stopping. On the next day, we all ate breakfast before going to work. We recorded how long we worked again before getting tired and stopping. Of interest was our mean increase in work time. Though not sure, my brother insisted that it was more than two hours. Using the data in Table 10.29, solve our problem. Work hours with breakfast Work hours without breakfast 8 6 7 5 9 5 5 4 9 7 8 7 10 7 7 5 6 6 9 5 Table 10.29 10.4 Matched or Paired Samples DIRECTIONS: For each of the word problems, use a solution sheet to do the hypothesis test.

(credit: Pete/flickr) Introduction Chapter Objectives By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: • Interpret the chi-square probability distribution as the sample size changes. • Conduct and interpret chi-square goodness-of-fit hypothesis tests. • Conduct and interpret chi-square test of independence hypothesis tests. • Conduct and interpret chi-square homogeneity hypothesis tests. • Conduct and interpret chi-square single variance hypothesis tests. Have you ever wondered if lottery numbers were evenly distributed or if some numbers occurred with a greater frequency? How about if the types of movies people preferred were different across different age groups? What about if a coffee machine was dispensing approximately the same amount of coffee each time? You could answer these questions by conducting a hypothesis test. Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution 621 You will now study a new distribution, one that is used to determine the answers to such questions. This distribution is called the chi-square distribution. In this chapter, you will learn the three major applications of the chi-square distribution: 1. the goodness-of-fit test, which determines if data fit a particular distribution, such as in the lottery example 2. the test of independence, which determines if events are independent, such as in the movie example 3. the test of a single variance, which tests variability, such as in the coffee example NOTE Though the chi-square distribution depends on calculators or computers for most of the calculations, there is a table available (see Appendix G). TI-83+ and TI-84 calculator instructions are included in the text. Look in the sports section of a newspaper or on the Internet for some sports data (baseball averages, basketball scores, golf tournament scores, football odds, swimming times, and the like). Plot a histogram and a boxplot using your data. See if you can determine a probability distribution that your data fits. Have a discussion with the class about your choice. 11.1 | Facts About the Chi-Square Distribution The notation for the chi-square distribution is: χ ∼χd f 2 where df = degrees of freedom which depends on how chi-square is being used. (If you want to practice calculating chi- square probabilities then use df = n - 1. The degrees of freedom for the three major uses are each calculated differently.) For the χ2 distribution, the population mean is μ = df and the population standard deviation is σ = 2(d f ). The random variable is shown as χ2, but may be any upper case letter. The random variable for a chi-square distribution with k degrees of freedom is the sum of k independent, squared standard normal variables. χ2 = (Z1)2 + (Z2)2 + ... + (Zk)2 1. The curve is nonsymmetrical and skewed to the right. 2. There is a different chi-square curve for each df. Figure 11.2 3. The test statistic for any test is always greater than or equal to zero. 622 Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 4. When df > 90, the chi-square curve approximates the normal distribution. For X ~ χ1,000 2 the mean, μ = df = 1,000 and the standard deviation, σ = 2(1,000)= 44.7. Therefore, X ~ N(1,000, 44.7), approximately. 5. The mean, μ, is located just to the right of the peak. Figure 11.3 11.2 | Goodness-of-Fit Test In this type of hypothesis test, you determine whether the data \"fit\" a particular distribution or not. For example, you may suspect your unknown data fit a binomial distribution. You use a chi-square test (meaning the distribution for the hypothesis test is chi-square) to determine if there is a fit or not. The null and the alternative hypotheses for this test may be written in sentences or may be stated as equations or inequalities. The test statistic for a goodness-of-fit test is: Σ k (O −E) 2 E where: • O = observed values (data) • E = expected values (from theory) • k = the number of different data cells or categories The observed values are the data values and the expected values are the values you would expect to get if the null hypothesis were true. There are n terms of the form (O −E) 2 E . The number of degrees of freedom is df = (number of categories – 1). The goodness-of-fit test is almost always right-tailed. If the observed values and the corresponding expected values are not close to each other, then the test statistic can get very large and will be way out in the right tail of the chi-square curve. NOTE The expected value for each cell needs to be at least five in order for you to use this test. Example 11.1 Absenteeism of college students from math classes is a major concern to math instructors because missing class appears to increase the drop rate. Suppose that a study was done to determine if the actual student absenteeism rate follows faculty perception. The faculty expected that a group of 100 students would miss class according to Table 11.1. Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution 623 Number of absences per term Expected number of students 0–2 50 3–5 30 6–8 12 9–11 6 12+ 2 Table 11.1 A random survey across all mathematics courses was then done to determine the actual number (observed) of absences in a course. The chart in Table 11.2 displays the results of that survey. Number of absences per term Actual number of students 0–2 35 3–5 40 6–8 20 9–11 1 12+ 4 Table 11.2 Determine the null and alternative hypotheses needed to conduct a goodness-of-fit test. H0: Student absenteeism fits faculty perception. The alternative hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis. Ha: Student absenteeism does not fit faculty perception. a. Can you use the information as it appears in the charts to conduct the goodness-of-fit test? Solution 11.1 a. No. Notice that the expected number of absences for the \"12+\" entry is less than five (it is two). Combine that group with the \"9–11\" group to create new tables where the number of students for each entry are at least five. The new results are in Table 11.2 and Table 11.3. Number of absences per term Expected number of students 0–2 50 3–5 30 6–8 12 9+ 8 Table 11.3 624 Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Number of absences per term Actual number of students 0–2 35 3–5 40 6–8 20 9+ 5 Table 11.4 b. What is the number of degrees of freedom (df)? Solution 11.1 b. There are four \"cells\" or categories in each of the new tables. df = number of cells – 1 = 4 – 1 = 3 11.1 A factory manager needs to understand how many products are defective versus how many are produced. The number of expected defects is listed in Table 11.5. Number produced Number defective 0–100 5 101–200 6 201–300 7 301–400 8 401–500 10 Table 11.5 A random sample was taken to determine the actual number of defects. Table 11.6 shows the results of the survey.

Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution 625 Example 11.2 Employers want to know which days of the week employees are absent in a five-day work week. Most employers would like to believe that employees are absent equally during the week. Suppose a random sample of 60 managers were asked on which day of the week they had the highest number of employee absences. The results were distributed as in Table 11.6. For the population of employees, do the days for the highest number of absences occur with equal frequencies during a five-day work week? Test at a 5% significance level. Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Number of Absences 15 12 9 9 15 Table 11.7 Day of the Week Employees were Most Absent Solution 11.2 The null and alternative hypotheses are: • H0: The absent days occur with equal frequencies, that is, they fit a uniform distribution. • Ha: The absent days occur with unequal frequencies, that is, they do not fit a uniform distribution. If the absent days occur with equal frequencies, then, out of 60 absent days (the total in the sample: 15 + 12 + 9 + 9 + 15 = 60), there would be 12 absences on Monday, 12 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, 12 on Thursday, and 12 on Friday. These numbers are the expected (E) values. The values in the table are the observed (O) values or data. This time, calculate the χ2 test statistic by hand. Make a chart with the following headings and fill in the columns: • Expected (E) values (12, 12, 12, 12, 12) • Observed (O) values (15, 12, 9, 9, 15) • (O – E) • (O – E)2 • (O – E) 2 E Now add (sum) the last column. The sum is three. This is the χ2 test statistic. To find the p-value, calculate P(χ2 > 3). This test is right-tailed. (Use a computer or calculator to find the p-value. You should get p-value = 0.5578.) The dfs are the number of cells – 1 = 5 – 1 = 4 Press 2nd DISTR. Arrow down to χ 2cdf. Press ENTER. Enter (3,10^99,4). Rounded to four decimal places, you should see 0.5578, which is the p-value. Next, complete a graph like the following one with the proper labeling and shading. (You should shade the right tail.) 626 Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Figure 11.4 The decision is not to reject the null hypothesis. Conclusion: At a 5% level of significance, from the sample data, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the absent days do not occur with equal frequencies. TI-83+ and some TI-84 calculators do not have a special program for the test statistic for the goodness-of- fit test. The next example Example 11.3 has the calculator instructions. The newer TI-84 calculators have in STAT TESTS the test Chi2 GOF. To run the test, put the observed values (the data) into a first list and the expected values (the values you expect if the null hypothesis is true) into a second list. Press STAT TESTS and Chi2 GOF. Enter the list names for the Observed list and the Expected list. Enter the degrees of freedom and press calculate or draw. Make sure you clear any lists before you start. To Clear Lists in the calculators: Go into STAT EDIT and arrow up to the list name area of the particular list. Press CLEAR and then arrow down. The list will be cleared. Alternatively, you can press STAT and press 4 (for ClrList). Enter the list name and press ENTER. 11.2 Teachers want to know which night each week their students are doing most of their homework. Most teachers think that students do homework equally throughout the week. Suppose a random sample of 56 students were asked on which night of the week they did the most homework. The results were distributed as in Table 11.8. Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Number of Students 11 8 10 7 10 5 5 Table 11.8 From the population of students, do the nights for the highest number of students doing the majority of their homework occur with equal frequencies during a week? What type of hypothesis test should you use? Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution 627 Example 11.3 628 Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 One study indicates that the number of televisions that American families have is distributed (this is the given distribution for the American population) as in Table 11.9. Number of Televisions Percent 0 10 1 16 2 55 3 11 4+ 8 Table 11.9 The table contains expected (E) percents. A random sample of 600 families in the far western United States resulted in the data in Table 11.10. Number of Televisions Frequency 0 66 1 119 2 340 3 60 4+ 15 Total = 600 Table 11.10 The table contains observed (O) frequency values. At the 1% significance level, does it appear that the distribution \"number of televisions\" of far western United States families is different from the distribution for the American population as a whole? Solution 11.3 This problem asks you to test whether the far western United States families distribution fits the distribution of the American families. This test is always right-tailed. The first table contains expected percentages. To get expected (E) frequencies, multiply the percentage by 600. The expected frequencies are shown in Table 11.10. Number of Televisions Percent Expected Frequency 0 10 (0.10)(600) = 60 1 16 (0.16)(600) = 96 2 55 (0.55)(600) = 330 3 11 (0.11)(600) = 66 over 3 8 (0.08)(600) = 48 Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution 629 Therefore, the expected frequencies are 60, 96, 330, 66, and 48. In the TI calculators, you can let the calculator do the math. For example, instead of 60, enter 0.10*600. H0: The \"number of televisions\" distribution of far western United States families is the same as the \"number of televisions\" distribution of the American population. Ha: The \"number of televisions\" distribution of far western United States families is different from the \"number of televisions\" distribution of the American population. Distribution for the test: χ4 2where df = (the number of cells) – 1 = 5 – 1 = 4. NOTE df ≠ 600 – 1 Calculate the test statistic: χ2 = 29.65 Graph: Figure 11.5 Probability statement: p-value = P(χ2 > 29.65) = 0.000006 Compare α and the p-value: • α = 0.01 • p-value = 0.000006 So, α > p-value. Make a decision: Since α > p-value, reject Ho. This means you reject the belief that the distribution for the far western states is the same as that of the American population as a whole. Conclusion: At the 1% significance level, from the data, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the \"number of televisions\" distribution for the far western United States is different from the \"number of televisions\" distribution for the American population as a whole. 630 Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Press STAT and ENTER.

What is the p-value? Example 11.4 Suppose you flip two coins 100 times. The results are 20 HH, 27 HT, 30 TH, and 23 TT. Are the coins fair? Test at a 5% significance level. Solution 11.4 This problem can be set up as a goodness-of-fit problem. The sample space for flipping two fair coins is {HH, HT, TH, TT}. Out of 100 flips, you would expect 25 HH, 25 HT, 25 TH, and 25 TT. This is the expected distribution. The question, \"Are the coins fair?\" is the same as saying, \"Does the distribution of the coins (20 HH, 27 HT, 30 TH, 23 TT) fit the expected distribution?\" Random Variable: Let X = the number of heads in one flip of the two coins. X takes on the values 0, 1, 2. (There are 0, 1, or 2 heads in the flip of two coins.) Therefore, the number of cells is three. Since X = the number of heads, the observed frequencies are 20 (for two heads), 57 (for one head), and 23 (for zero heads or both tails). The expected frequencies are 25 (for two heads), 50 (for one head), and 25 (for zero heads or both tails). This test is right-tailed. H0: The coins are fair. Ha: The coins are not fair. Distribution for the test: χ2 2where df = 3 – 1 = 2.

Table 11.14 shows the actual literacy rates across the world broken down by region. What are the test statistic and the degrees of freedom? MDG Region Adult Literacy Rate (%) Developed Regions 99.0 Commonwealth of Independent States 99.5 Northern Africa 67.3 Sub-Saharan Africa 62.5 Latin America and the Caribbean 91.0 Eastern Asia 93.8 Southern Asia 61.9 South-Eastern Asia 91.9 Western Asia 84.5 Oceania 66.4 Table 11.14 11.3 | Test of Independence Tests of independence involve using a contingency table of observed (data) values. The test statistic for a test of independence is similar to that of a goodness-of-fit test: Σ (i⋅ j) (O –E) 2 E where: • O = observed values • E = expected values • i = the number of rows in the table Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution 633 • j = the number of columns in the table There are i⋅ jterms of the form (O –E) 2 E . A test of independence determines whether two factors are independent or not. You first encountered the term independence in Probability Topics. As a review, consider the following example. NOTE The expected value for each cell needs to be at least five in order for you to use this test. Example 11.5 Suppose A = a speeding violation in the last year and B = a cell phone user while driving. If A and B are independent then P(A AND B) = P(A)P(B). A AND B is the event that a driver received a speeding violation last year and also used a cell phone while driving. Suppose, in a study of drivers who received speeding violations in the last year, and who used cell phone while driving, that 755 people were surveyed. Out of the 755, 70 had a speeding violation and 685 did not; 305 used cell phones while driving and 450 did not. Let y = expected number of drivers who used a cell phone while driving and received speeding violations. If A and B are independent, then P(A AND B) = P(A)P(B). By substitution, y 755 = ⎛ ⎝ 70 755 ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝ 305 755 ⎞ ⎠ Solve for y: y = (70)(305) 755= 28.3 About 28 people from the sample are expected to use cell phones while driving and to receive speeding violations. In a test of independence, we state the null and alternative hypotheses in words. Since the contingency table consists of two factors, the null hypothesis states that the factors are independent and the alternative hypothesis states that they are not independent (dependent). If we do a test of independence using the example, then the null hypothesis is: H0: Being a cell phone user while driving and receiving a speeding violation are independent events. If the null hypothesis were true, we would expect about 28 people to use cell phones while driving and to receive a speeding violation. The test of independence is always right-tailed because of the calculation of the test statistic. If the expected and observed values are not close together, then the test statistic is very large and way out in the right tail of the chi-square curve, as it is in a goodness-of-fit. The number of degrees of freedom for the test of independence is: df = (number of columns - 1)(number of rows - 1) The following formula calculates the expected number (E): E=(row total)(column total) total number surveyed 11.5 A sample of 300 students is taken. Of the students surveyed, 50 were music students, while 250 were not. Ninety- seven were on the honor roll, while 203 were not. If we assume being a music student and being on the honor roll are independent events, what is the expected number of music students who are also on the honor roll? 634 Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Example 11.6 In a volunteer group, adults 21 and older volunteer from one to nine hours each week to spend time with a disabled senior citizen. The program recruits among community college students, four-year college students, and nonstudents. In Table 11.15 is a sample of the adult volunteers and the number of hours they volunteer per week. Type of Volunteer 1–3 Hours 4–6 Hours 7–9 Hours Row Total Community College Students 111 96 48 255 Four-Year College Students 96 133 61 290 Nonstudents 91 150 53 294 Column Total 298 379 162 839 Table 11.15 Number of Hours Worked Per Week by Volunteer Type (Observed) The table contains observed (O) values (data). Is the number of hours volunteered independent of the type of volunteer? Solution 11.6 The observed table and the question at the end of the problem, \"Is the number of hours volunteered independent of the type of volunteer?\" tell you this is a test of independence. The two factors are number of hours volunteered and type of volunteer. This test is always right-tailed. H0: The number of hours volunteered is independent of the type of volunteer. Ha: The number of hours volunteered is dependent on the type of volunteer. The expected result are in Table 11.15. Type of Volunteer 1-3 Hours 4-6 Hours 7-9 Hours Community College Students 90.57 115.19 49.24 Four-Year College Students 103.00 131.00 56.00 Nonstudents 104.42 132.81 56.77 Table 11.16 Number of Hours Worked Per Week by Volunteer Type (Expected) The table contains expected (E) values (data). For example, the calculation for the expected frequency for the top left cell is E=(row total)(column total) total number surveyed =(255)(298) 839 = 90.57 Calculate the test statistic: χ2 = 12.99 (calculator or computer) Distribution for the test: χ4 2 df = (3 columns – 1)(3 rows – 1) = (2)(2) = 4 Graph: Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution 635 Figure 11.7 Probability statement: p-value=P(χ2 > 12.99) = 0.0113 Compare α and the p-value: Since no α is given, assume α = 0.05. p-value = 0.0113. α > p-value. Make a decision: Since α > p-value, reject H0. This means that the factors are not independent. Conclusion: At a 5% level of significance, from the data, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the number of hours volunteered and the type of volunteer are dependent on one another.

A different test, called the test for homogeneity, can be used to draw a conclusion about whether two populations have the same distribution. To calculate the test statistic for a test for homogeneity, follow the same procedure as with the test of independence. NOTE The expected value for each cell needs to be at least five in order for you to use this test. Hypotheses H0: The distributions of the two populations are the same. Ha: The distributions of the two populations are not the same. Test Statistic Use a χ 2test statistic. It is computed in the same way as the test for independence. Degrees of Freedom (df) df = number of columns - 1 Requirements All values in the table must be greater than or equal to five. Common Uses Comparing two populations. For example: men vs. women, before vs. after, east vs. west. The variable is categorical with more than two possible response values. Example 11.8 Do male and female college students have the same distribution of living arrangements? Use a level of significance of 0.05. Suppose that 250 randomly selected male college students and 300 randomly selected female college students were asked about their living arrangements: dormitory, apartment, with parents, other. 638 Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 The results are shown in Table 11.18.

Conclusion: At a 5% level of significance, from the data, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the distributions of living arrangements for male and female college students are not the same. Notice that the conclusion is only that the distributions are not the same. We cannot use the test for homogeneity to draw any conclusions about how they differ. 11.8 Do families and singles have the same distribution of cars? Use a level of significance of 0.05.

State the null and alternative hypotheses, the degrees of freedom and the test statistic, sketch the graph of the p-value, and draw a conclusion about the test of homogeneity. 11.5 | Comparison of the Chi-Square Tests You have seen the χ2 test statistic used in three different circumstances. The following bulleted list is a summary that will help you decide which χ2 test is the appropriate one to use. • Goodness-of-Fit: Use the goodness-of-fit test to decide whether a population with an unknown distribution \"fits\" a known distribution. In this case there will be a single qualitative survey question or a single outcome of an experiment from a single population. Goodness-of-Fit is typically used to see if the population is uniform (all outcomes occur with equal frequency), the population is normal, or the population is the same as another population with a known distribution. The null and alternative hypotheses are: H0: The population fits the given distribution. Ha: The population does not fit the given distribution. • Independence: Use the test for independence to decide whether two variables (factors) are independent or dependent. In this case there will be two qualitative survey questions or experiments and a contingency table will be constructed. The goal is to see if the two variables are unrelated (independent) or related (dependent). The null and alternative hypotheses are: H0: The two variables (factors) are independent. Ha: The two variables (factors) are dependent. • Homogeneity: Use the test for homogeneity to decide if two populations with unknown distributions have the same distribution as each other. In this case there will be a single qualitative survey question or experiment given to two different populations. The null and alternative hypotheses are: H0: The two populations follow the same distribution. Ha: The two populations have different distributions. 11.6 | Test of a Single Variance A test of a single variance assumes that the underlying distribution is normal. The null and alternative hypotheses are stated in terms of the population variance (or population standard deviation). The test statistic is: Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution 641 ⎛ ⎝n- 1 ⎞ ⎠s 2 σ 2 where: • n = the total number of data • s2 = sample variance • σ2 = population variance You may think of s as the random variable in this test. The number of degrees of freedom is df = n - 1. A test of a single variance may be right-tailed, left-tailed, or two-tailed. Example 11.10 will show you how to set up the null and alternative hypotheses. The null and alternative hypotheses contain statements about the population variance. Example 11.10 Math instructors are not only interested in how their students do on exams, on average, but how the exam scores vary. To many instructors, the variance (or standard deviation) may be more important than the average. Suppose a math instructor believes that the standard deviation for his final exam is five points. One of his best students thinks otherwise. The student claims that the standard deviation is more than five points. If the student were to conduct a hypothesis test, what would the null and alternative hypotheses be? Solution 11.10 Even though we are given the population standard deviation, we can set up the test using the population variance as follows. • H0: σ2 = 52 • Ha: σ2 > 52 11.10 A SCUBA instructor wants to record the collective depths each of his students dives during their checkout. He is interested in how the depths vary, even though everyone should have been at the same depth. He believes the standard deviation is three feet. His assistant thinks the standard deviation is less than three feet. If the instructor were to conduct a test, what would the null and alternative hypotheses be? Example 11.11 With individual lines at its various windows, a post office finds that the standard deviation for normally distributed waiting times for customers on Friday afternoon is 7.2 minutes. The post office experiments with a single, main waiting line and finds that for a random sample of 25 customers, the waiting times for customers have a standard deviation of 3.5 minutes. With a significance level of 5%, test the claim that a single line causes lower variation among waiting times (shorter waiting times) for customers. Solution 11.11 Since the claim is that a single line causes less variation, this is a test of a single variance. The parameter is the population variance, σ2, or the population standard deviation, σ. Random Variable: The sample standard deviation, s, is the random variable. Let s = standard deviation for the waiting times. 642 Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 • H0: σ2 = 7.22 • Ha: σ2 < 7.22 The word \"less\" tells you this is a left-tailed test. Distribution for the test: χ24 2 , where: • n = the number of customers sampled • df = n – 1 = 25 – 1 = 24 Calculate the test statistic: χ 2=(n − 1)s 2 σ 2 =(25 − 1)(3.5) 2 7.2 2 = 5.67 where n = 25, s = 3.5, and σ = 7.2. Graph: Figure 11.8 Probability statement: p-value = P ( χ2 < 5.67) = 0.000042 Compare α and the p-value: α = 0.05; p-value = 0.000042; α > p-value Make a decision: Since α > p-value, reject H0. This means that you reject σ2 = 7.2 2. In other words, you do not think the variation in waiting times is 7.2 minutes; you think the variation in waiting times is less. Conclusion: At a 5% level of significance, from the data, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that a single line causes a lower variation among the waiting times or with a single line, the customer waiting times vary less than 7.2 minutes. In 2nd DISTR, use 7:χ2cdf. The syntax is (lower, upper, df) for the parameter list. For Example 11.11, χ2cdf(-1E99,5.67,24). The p-value = 0.000042. 11.11 The FCC conducts broadband speed tests to measure how much data per second passes between a consumer’s computer and the internet. As of August of 2012, the standard deviation of Internet speeds across Internet Service Providers (ISPs) was 12.2 percent. Suppose a sample of 15 ISPs is taken, and the standard deviation is 13.2. An analyst claims that the standard deviation of speeds is more than what was reported. State the null and alternative hypotheses, compute the degrees of freedom, the test statistic, sketch the graph of the p-value, and draw a conclusion.

CHAPTER REVIEW 11.1 Facts About the Chi-Square Distribution The chi-square distribution is a useful tool for assessment in a series of problem categories. These problem categories include primarily (i) whether a data set fits a particular distribution, (ii) whether the distributions of two populations are the same, (iii) whether two events might be independent, and (iv) whether there is a different variability than expected within a population. An important parameter in a chi-square distribution is the degrees of freedom df in a given problem. The random variable in the chi-square distribution is the sum of squares of df standard normal variables, which must be independent. The key characteristics of the chi-square distribution also depend directly on the degrees of freedom. The chi-square distribution curve is skewed to the right, and its shape depends on the degrees of freedom df. For df > 90, the curve approximates the normal distribution. Test statistics based on the chi-square distribution are always greater than or equal to zero. Such application tests are almost always right-tailed tests. 11.2 Goodness-of-Fit Test To assess whether a data set fits a specific distribution, you can apply the goodness-of-fit hypothesis test that uses the chi-square distribution. The null hypothesis for this test states that the data come from the assumed distribution. The test compares observed values against the values you would expect to have if your data followed the assumed distribution. The test is almost always right-tailed. Each observation or cell category must have an expected value of at least five. 11.3 Test of Independence To assess whether two factors are independent or not, you can apply the test of independence that uses the chi-square distribution. The null hypothesis for this test states that the two factors are independent. The test compares observed values to expected values. The test is right-tailed. Each observation or cell category must have an expected value of at least 5. 11.4 Test for Homogeneity To assess whether two data sets are derived from the same distribution—which need not be known, you can apply the test for homogeneity that uses the chi-square distribution. The null hypothesis for this test states that the populations of the two data sets come from the same distribution. The test compares the observed values against the expected values if the two populations followed the same distribution. The test is right-tailed. Each observation or cell category must have an expected value of at least five. 11.5 Comparison of the Chi-Square Tests The goodness-of-fit test is typically used to determine if data fits a particular distribution. The test of independence makes use of a contingency table to determine the independence of two factors. The test for homogeneity determines whether two populations come from the same distribution, even if this distribution is unknown. 11.6 Test of a Single Variance To test variability, use the chi-square test of a single variance. The test may be left-, right-, or two-tailed, and its hypotheses are always expressed in terms of the variance (or standard deviation).

Is there a difference between the distribution of community college statistics students and the distribution of university statistics students in what technology they use on their homework? Of some randomly selected community college students, 43 used a computer, 102 used a calculator with built in statistics functions, and 65 used a table from the textbook. Of some randomly selected university students, 28 used a computer, 33 used a calculator with built in statistics functions, and 40 used a table from the textbook. Conduct an appropriate hypothesis test using a 0.05 level of significance. Read the statement and decide whether it is true or false. 108. If df = 2, the chi-square distribution has a shape that reminds us of the exponential. 11.6 Test of a Single Variance Use the following information to answer the next twelve exercises: Suppose an airline claims that its flights are consistently on time with an average delay of at most 15 minutes. It claims that the average delay is so consistent that the variance is no more than 150 minutes. Doubting the consistency part of the claim, a disgruntled traveler calculates the delays for his next 25 flights. The average delay for those 25 flights is 22 minutes with a standard deviation of 15 minutes. 109. Is the traveler disputing the claim about the average or about the variance? 110. A sample standard deviation of 15 minutes is the same as a sample variance of __________ minutes. 111. Is this a right-tailed, left-tailed, or two-tailed test? 112. H0: __________ 113. df = ________ 114. chi-square test statistic = ________ 115. p-value = ________ 116. Graph the situation. Label and scale the horizontal axis. Mark the mean and test statistic.

A plant manager is concerned her equipment may need recalibrating. It seems that the actual weight of the 15 oz. cereal boxes it fills has been fluctuating. The standard deviation should be at most 0.5 oz. In order to determine if the machine needs to be recalibrated, 84 randomly selected boxes of cereal from the next day’s production were weighed. The standard deviation of the 84 boxes was 0.54. Does the machine need to be recalibrated? 122. Consumers may be interested in whether the cost of a particular calculator varies from store to store. Based on surveying 43 stores, which yielded a sample mean of $84 and a sample standard deviation of $12, test the claim that the standard deviation is greater than $15. 123. Isabella, an accomplished Bay to Breakers runner, claims that the standard deviation for her time to run the 7.5 mile race is at most three minutes. To test her claim, Rupinder looks up five of her race times. They are 55 minutes, 61 minutes, 58 minutes, 63 minutes, and 57 minutes. 124. Airline companies are interested in the consistency of the number of babies on each flight, so that they have adequate safety equipment. They are also interested in the variation of the number of babies. Suppose that an airline executive believes the average number of babies on flights is six with a variance of nine at most. The airline conducts a survey. The results of the 18 flights surveyed give a sample average of 6.4 with a sample standard deviation of 3.9. Conduct a hypothesis test of the airline executive’s belief. 125. The number of births per woman in China is 1.6 down from 5.91 in 1966. This fertility rate has been attributed to the law passed in 1979 restricting births to one per woman. Suppose that a group of students studied whether or not the standard deviation of births per woman was greater than 0.75. They asked 50 women across China the number of births they had had. The results are shown in Table 11.59. Does the students’ survey indicate that the standard deviation is greater than 0.75? # of births Frequency 0 5 1 30 2 10 3 5 Table 11.59 126. According to an avid aquarist, the average number of fish in a 20-gallon tank is 10, with a standard deviation of two. His friend, also an aquarist, does not believe that the standard deviation is two. She counts the number of fish in 15 other 20-gallon tanks. Based on the results that follow, do you think that the standard deviation is different from two? Data: 11; 10; 9; 10; 10; 11; 11; 10; 12; 9; 7; 9; 11; 10; 11 127. The manager of \"Frenchies\" is concerned that patrons are not consistently receiving the same amount of French fries with each order. The chef claims that the standard deviation for a ten-ounce order of fries is at most 1.5 oz., but the manager thinks that it may be higher. He randomly weighs 49 orders of fries, which yields a mean of 11 oz. and a standard deviation of two oz. 128. You want to buy a specific computer. A sales representative of the manufacturer claims that retail stores sell this computer at an average price of $1,249 with a very narrow standard deviation of $25. You find a website that has a price comparison for the same computer at a series of stores as follows: $1,299; $1,229.99; $1,193.08; $1,279; $1,224.95; $1,229.99; $1,269.95; $1,249. Can you argue that pricing has a larger standard deviation than claimed by the manufacturer? Use the 5% significance level. As a potential buyer, what would be the practical conclusion from your analysis? 129. A company packages apples by weight. One of the weight grades is Class A apples. Class A apples have a mean weight of 150 g, and there is a maximum allowed weight tolerance of 5% above or below the mean for apples in the same consumer package. A batch of apples is selected to be included in a Class A apple package. Given the following apple weights of the batch, does the fruit comply with the Class A grade weight tolerance requirements. Conduct an appropriate hypothesis test. (a) at the 5% significance level (b) at the 1% significance level Weights in selected apple batch (in grams): 158; 167; 149; 169; 164; 139; 154; 150; 157; 171; 152; 161; 141; 166; 172; Chapter 11 | The Chi-Square Distribution 669 BRINGING IT TOGETHER: HOMEWORK 130. a.

Professionals often want to know how two or more numeric variables are related. For example, is there a relationship between the grade on the second math exam a student takes and the grade on the final exam? If there is a relationship, what is the relationship and how strong is it? In another example, your income may be determined by your education, your profession, your years of experience, and your ability. The amount you pay a repair person for labor is often determined by an initial amount plus an hourly fee. Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation 679 The type of data described in the examples is bivariate data — \"bi\" for two variables. In reality, statisticians use multivariate data, meaning many variables. In this chapter, you will be studying the simplest form of regression, \"linear regression\" with one independent variable (x). This involves data that fits a line in two dimensions. You will also study correlation which measures how strong the relationship is. 12.1 | Linear Equations Linear regression for two variables is based on a linear equation with one independent variable. The equation has the form: y=a + bx where a and b are constant numbers. The variable x is the independent variable, and y is the dependent variable. Typically, you choose a value to substitute for the independent variable and then solve for the dependent variable. Example 12.1 The following examples are linear equations. y= 3 + 2x y= –0.01 + 1.2x 12.1 Is the following an example of a linear equation? y = –0.125 – 3.5x The graph of a linear equation of the form y = a + bx is a straight line. Any line that is not vertical can be described by this equation. Example 12.2 Graph the equation y = –1 + 2x. 680 Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Figure 12.2 12.2 Is the following an example of a linear equation? Why or why not? Figure 12.3 Example 12.3 Aaron's Word Processing Service (AWPS) does word processing. The rate for services is $32 per hour plus a $31.50 one-time charge. The total cost to a customer depends on the number of hours it takes to complete the job. Find the equation that expresses the total cost in terms of the number of hours required to complete the job. Solution 12.3 Let x = the number of hours it takes to get the job done. Let y = the total cost to the customer. The $31.50 is a fixed cost. If it takes x hours to complete the job, then (32)(x) is the cost of the word processing only. The total cost is: y = 31.50 + 32x Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation 681 12.3 Emma’s Extreme Sports hires hang-gliding instructors and pays them a fee of $50 per class as well as $20 per student in the class. The total cost Emma pays depends on the number of students in a class. Find the equation that expresses the total cost in terms of the number of students in a class. Slope and Y-Intercept of a Linear Equation For the linear equation y = a + bx, b = slope and a = y-intercept. From algebra recall that the slope is a number that describes the steepness of a line, and the y-intercept is the y coordinate of the point (0, a) where the line crosses the y-axis. Figure 12.4 Three possible graphs of y = a + bx. (a) If b > 0, the line slopes upward to the right. (b) If b = 0, the line is horizontal. (c) If b < 0, the line slopes downward to the right. Example 12.4 Svetlana tutors to make extra money for college. For each tutoring session, she charges a one-time fee of $25 plus $15 per hour of tutoring. A linear equation that expresses the total amount of money Svetlana earns for each session she tutors is y = 25 + 15x. What are the independent and dependent variables? What is the y-intercept and what is the slope? Interpret them using complete sentences. Solution 12.4 The independent variable (x) is the number of hours Svetlana tutors each session. The dependent variable (y) is the amount, in dollars, Svetlana earns for each session. The y-intercept is 25 (a = 25). At the start of the tutoring session, Svetlana charges a one-time fee of $25 (this is when x = 0). The slope is 15 (b = 15). For each session, Svetlana earns $15 for each hour she tutors. 12.4 Ethan repairs household appliances like dishwashers and refrigerators. For each visit, he charges $25 plus $20 per hour of work. A linear equation that expresses the total amount of money Ethan earns per visit is y = 25 + 20x. What are the independent and dependent variables? What is the y-intercept and what is the slope? Interpret them using complete sentences. 12.2 | Scatter Plots Before we take up the discussion of linear regression and correlation, we need to examine a way to display the relation between two variables x and y. The most common and easiest way is a scatter plot. The following example illustrates a scatter plot. 682 Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Example 12.5 In Europe and Asia, m-commerce is popular. M-commerce users have special mobile phones that work like electronic wallets as well as provide phone and Internet services. Users can do everything from paying for parking to buying a TV set or soda from a machine to banking to checking sports scores on the Internet. For the years 2000 through 2004, was there a relationship between the year and the number of m-commerce users? Construct a scatter plot. Let x = the year and let y = the number of m-commerce users, in millions. x (year) y (# of users) 2000 0.5 2002 20.0 2003 33.0 2004 47.0 Table 12.1 (a) Table showing the number of m- commerce users (in millions) by year. (b) Scatter plot showing the number of m-commerce users (in millions) by year. Figure 12.5 To create a scatter plot: 1. Enter your X data into list L1 and your Y data into list L2. 2. Press 2nd STATPLOT ENTER to use Plot 1. On the input screen for PLOT 1, highlight On and press ENTER. (Make sure the other plots are OFF.) 3. For TYPE: highlight the very first icon, which is the scatter plot, and press ENTER. 4. For Xlist:, enter L1 ENTER and for Ylist: L2 ENTER. 5. For Mark: it does not matter which symbol you highlight, but the square is the easiest to see. Press ENTER. 6. Make sure there are no other equations that could be plotted. Press Y = and clear any equations out. 7. Press the ZOOM key and then the number 9 (for menu item \"ZoomStat\") ; the calculator will fit the window to the data. You can press WINDOW to see the scaling of the axes. 12.5 Amelia plays basketball for her high school. She wants to improve to play at the college level. She notices that the number of points she scores in a game goes up in response to the number of hours she practices her jump shot each week. She records the following data: Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation 683 X (hours practicing jump shot) Y (points scored in a game) 5 15 7 22 9 28 10 31 11 33 12 36 Table 12.2 Construct a scatter plot and state if what Amelia thinks appears to be true. A scatter plot shows the direction of a relationship between the variables. A clear direction happens when there is either: • High values of one variable occurring with high values of the other variable or low values of one variable occurring with low values of the other variable. • High values of one variable occurring with low values of the other variable. You can determine the strength of the relationship by looking at the scatter plot and seeing how close the points are to a line, a power function, an exponential function, or to some other type of function. For a linear relationship there is an exception. Consider a scatter plot where all the points fall on a horizontal line providing a \"perfect fit.\" The horizontal line would in fact show no relationship. When you look at a scatterplot, you want to notice the overall pattern and any deviations from the pattern. The following scatterplot examples illustrate these concepts. Figure 12.6 Figure 12.7 684 Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Figure 12.8 In this chapter, we are interested in scatter plots that show a linear pattern. Linear patterns are quite common. The linear relationship is strong if the points are close to a straight line, except in the case of a horizontal line where there is no relationship. If we think that the points show a linear relationship, we would like to draw a line on the scatter plot. This line can be calculated through a process called linear regression. However, we only calculate a regression line if one of the variables helps to explain or predict the other variable. If x is the independent variable and y the dependent variable, then we can use a regression line to predict y for a given value of x 12.3 | The Regression Equation Data rarely fit a straight line exactly. Usually, you must be satisfied with rough predictions. Typically, you have a set of data whose scatter plot appears to \"fit\" a straight line. This is called a Line of Best Fit or Least-Squares Line. If you know a person's pinky (smallest) finger length, do you think you could predict that person's height? Collect data from your class (pinky finger length, in inches). The independent variable, x, is pinky finger length and the dependent variable, y, is height. For each set of data, plot the points on graph paper. Make your graph big enough and use a ruler. Then \"by eye\" draw a line that appears to \"fit\" the data. For your line, pick two convenient points and use them to find the slope of the line. Find the y-intercept of the line by extending your line so it crosses the y-axis. Using the slopes and the y-intercepts, write your equation of \"best fit.\" Do you think everyone will have the same equation? Why or why not? According to your equation, what is the predicted height for a pinky length of 2.5 inches? Example 12.6 A random sample of 11 statistics students produced the following data, where x is the third exam score out of 80, and y is the final exam score out of 200. Can you predict the final exam score of a random student if you know the third exam score? Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation 685 x (third exam score) y (final exam score) 65 175 67 133 71 185 71 163 66 126 75 198 67 153 70 163 71 159 69 151 69 159 Table 12.3 (a) Table showing the scores on the final exam based on scores from the third exam. (b) Scatter plot showing the scores on the final exam based on scores from the third exam. Figure 12.9 12.6 SCUBA divers have maximum dive times they cannot exceed when going to different depths. The data in Table 12.4 show different depths with the maximum dive times in minutes. Use your calculator to find the least squares regression line and predict the maximum dive time for 110 feet. X (depth in feet) Y (maximum dive time) 50 80 60 55 70 45 80 35 90 25 100 22 Table 12.4 The third exam score, x, is the independent variable and the final exam score, y, is the dependent variable. We will plot a regression line that best \"fits\" the data. If each of you were to fit a line \"by eye,\" you would draw different lines. We can use what is called a least-squares regression line to obtain the best fit line. Consider the following diagram. Each point of data is of the the form (x, y) and each point ofthe line of best fit using least- 686 Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 squares linear regression has the form (x, ŷ). The ŷ is read \"y hat\" and is the estimated value of y. It is the value of y obtained using the regression line. It is not generally equal to y from data. Figure 12.10 The term y0 – ŷ0 = ε0 is called the \"error\" or residual. It is not an error in the sense of a mistake. The absolute value of a residual measures the vertical distance between the actual value of y and the estimated value of y. In other words, it measures the vertical distance between the actual data point and the predicted point on the line. If the observed data point lies above the line, the residual is positive, and the line underestimates the actual data value for y. If the observed data point lies below the line, the residual is negative, and the line overestimates that actual data value for y. In the diagram in Figure 12.10, y0 – ŷ0 = ε0 is the residual for the point shown. Here the point lies above the line and the residual is positive. ε = the Greek letter epsilon For each data point, you can calculate the residuals or errors, yi - ŷi = εi for i = 1, 2, 3, ..., 11. Each |ε| is a vertical distance. For the example about the third exam scores and the final exam scores for the 11 statistics students, there are 11 data points. Therefore, there are 11 ε values. If yousquare each ε and add, you get (ε1) 2+ (ε2) 2+ ... + (ε11) 2= Σ i = 1 11 ε2 This is called the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE). Using calculus, you can determine the values of a and b that make the SSE a minimum. When you make the SSE a minimum, you have determined the points that are on the line of best fit. It turns out that the line of best fit has the equation: y^ =a + bx where a = y¯ −b x¯ and b =Σ(x− x¯ )(y− y¯ ) Σ(x− x¯ ) 2 . The sample means of the x values and the y values are x¯ and y¯ , respectively. The best fit line always passes through the point (x¯ , y¯ ). The slope b can be written as b =r ⎛ ⎝ sy sx ⎞ ⎠where sy = the standard deviation of the y values and sx = the standard deviation of the x values. r is the correlation coefficient, which is discussed in the next section. Least Squares Criteria for Best Fit The process of fitting the best-fit line is called linear regression. The idea behind finding the best-fit line is based on the assumption that the data are scattered about a straight line. The criteria for the best fit line is that the sum of the squared errors (SSE) is minimized, that is, made as small as possible. Any other line you might choose would have a higher SSE than the best fit line. This best fit line is called the least-squares regression line . Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation 687 NOTE Computer spreadsheets, statistical software, and many calculators can quickly calculate the best-fit line and create the graphs. The calculations tend to be tedious if done by hand. Instructions to use the TI-83, TI-83+, and TI-84+ calculators to find the best-fit line and create a scatterplot are shown at the end of this section. THIRD EXAM vs FINAL EXAM EXAMPLE: The graph of the line of best fit for the third-exam/final-exam example is as follows: Figure 12.11 The least squares regression line (best-fit line) for the third-exam/final-exam example has the equation: y^ = − 173.51 + 4.83x REMINDER Remember, it is always important to plot a scatter diagram first. If the scatter plot indicates that there is a linear relationship between the variables, then it is reasonable to use a best fit line to make predictions for y given x within the domain of x-values in the sample data, but not necessarily for x-values outside that domain. You could use the line to predict the final exam score for a student who earned a grade of 73 on the third exam. You should NOT use the line to predict the final exam score for a student who earned a grade of 50 on the third exam, because 50 is not within the domain of the x-values in the sample data, which are between 65 and 75. UNDERSTANDING SLOPE The slope of the line, b, describes how changes in the variables are related. It is important to interpret the slope of the line in the context of the situation represented by the data. You should be able to write a sentence interpreting the slope in plain English. INTERPRETATION OF THE SLOPE: The slope of the best-fit line tells us how the dependent variable (y) changes for every one unit increase in the independent (x) variable, on average. THIRD EXAM vs FINAL EXAM EXAMPLE Slope: The slope of the line is b = 4.83. Interpretation: For a one-point increase in the score on the third exam, the final exam score increases by 4.83 points, on average. 688 Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Using the Linear Regression T Test: LinRegTTest 1. In the STAT list editor, enter the X data in list L1 and the Y data in list L2, paired so that the corresponding (x,y) values are next to each other in the lists.

Then arrow down to Calculate and do the calculation for the line of best fit. 4. Press Y = (you will see the regression equation). 5. Press GRAPH. The line will be drawn.\" The Correlation Coefficient r Besides looking at the scatter plot and seeing that a line seems reasonable, how can you tell if the line is a good predictor? Use the correlation coefficient as another indicator (besides the scatterplot) of the strength of the relationship between x and y. The correlation coefficient, r, developed by Karl Pearson in the early 1900s, is numerical and provides a measure of strength and direction of the linear association between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y. The correlation coefficient is calculated as r= nΣ(xy) − (Σx)(Σy) ⎡ ⎣nΣx 2− (Σx) 2⎤ ⎦ ⎡ ⎣nΣy 2− (Σy) 2⎤ ⎦ where n = the number of data points. If you suspect a linear relationship between x and y, then r can measure how strong the linear relationship is. What the VALUE of r tells us: • The value of r is always between –1 and +1: –1 ≤ r ≤ 1. • The size of the correlation r indicates the strength of the linear relationship between x and y. Values of r close to –1 or to +1 indicate a stronger linear relationship between x and y. • If r = 0 there is absolutely no linear relationship between x and y (no linear correlation). • If r = 1, there is perfect positive correlation. If r = –1, there is perfect negative correlation. In both these cases, all of the original data points lie on a straight line. Of course,in the real world, this will not generally happen. What the SIGN of r tells us • A positive value of r means that when x increases, y tends to increase and when x decreases, y tends to decrease (positive correlation). • A negative value of r means that when x increases, y tends to decrease and when x decreases, y tends to increase (negative correlation). • The sign of r is the same as the sign of the slope, b, of the best-fit line. NOTE Strong correlation does not suggest that x causes y or y causes x. We say \"correlation does not imply causation.\" 690 Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Figure 12.13 (a) A scatter plot showing data with a positive correlation. 0 < r < 1 (b) A scatter plot showing data with a negative correlation. –1 < r < 0 (c) A scatter plot showing data with zero correlation. r = 0 The formula for r looks formidable. However, computer spreadsheets, statistical software, and many calculators can quickly calculate r. The correlation coefficient r is the bottom item in the output screens for the LinRegTTest on the TI-83, TI-83+, or TI-84+ calculator (see previous section for instructions). The Coefficient of Determination The variable r2 is called the coefficient of determination and is the square of the correlation coefficient, but is usually stated as a percent, rather than in decimal form. It has an interpretation in the context of the data: • r 2, when expressed as a percent, represents the percent of variation in the dependent (predicted) variable y that can be explained by variation in the independent (explanatory) variable x using the regression (best-fit) line. • 1 – r 2, when expressed as a percentage, represents the percent of variation in y that is NOT explained by variation in x using the regression line. This can be seen as the scattering of the observed data points about the regression line. Consider the third exam/final exam example introduced in the previous section • The line of best fit is: ŷ = –173.51 + 4.83x • The correlation coefficient is r = 0.6631 • The coefficient of determination is r2 = 0.66312 = 0.4397 • Interpretation of r2 in the context of this example: • Approximately 44% of the variation (0.4397 is approximately 0.44) in the final-exam grades can be explained by the variation in the grades on the third exam, using the best-fit regression line. • Therefore, approximately 56% of the variation (1 – 0.44 = 0.56) in the final exam grades can NOT be explained by the variation in the grades on the third exam, using the best-fit regression line. (This is seen as the scattering of the points about the line.) 12.4 | Testing the Significance of the Correlation Coefficient The correlation coefficient, r, tells us about the strength and direction of the linear relationship between x and y. However, the reliability of the linear model also depends on how many observed data points are in the sample. We need to look at both the value of the correlation coefficient r and the sample size n, together. We perform a hypothesis test of the \"significance of the correlation coefficient\" to decide whether the linear relationship in the sample data is strong enough to use to model the relationship in the population. The sample data are used to compute r, the correlation coefficient for the sample. If we had data for the entire population, we could find the population correlation coefficient. But because we have only have sample data, we cannot calculate the population correlation coefficient. The sample correlation coefficient, r, is our estimate of the unknown population correlation coefficient. The symbol for the population correlation coefficient is ρ, the Greek letter \"rho.\" ρ = population correlation coefficient (unknown) r = sample correlation coefficient (known; calculated from sample data) The hypothesis test lets us decide whether the value of the population correlation coefficient ρ is \"close to zero\" or \"significantly different from zero\". We decide this based on the sample correlation coefficient r and the sample size n. If the test concludes that the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero, we say that the Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation 691 correlation coefficient is \"significant.\" • Conclusion: There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between x and y because the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero. • What the conclusion means: There is a significant linear relationship between x and y. We can use the regression line to model the linear relationship between x and y in the population. If the test concludes that the correlation coefficient is not significantly different from zero (it is close to zero), we say that correlation coefficient is \"not significant\". • Conclusion: \"There is insufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between x and y because the correlation coefficient is not significantly different from zero.\" • What the conclusion means: There is not a significant linear relationship between x and y. Therefore, we CANNOT use the regression line to model a linear relationship between x and y in the population. NOTE • If r is significant and the scatter plot shows a linear trend, the line can be used to predict the value of y for values of x that are within the domain of observed x values. • If r is not significant OR if the scatter plot does not show a linear trend, the line should not be used for prediction. • If r is significant and if the scatter plot shows a linear trend, the line may NOT be appropriate or reliable for prediction OUTSIDE the domain of observed x values in the data. PERFORMING THE HYPOTHESIS TEST • Null Hypothesis: H0: ρ = 0 • Alternate Hypothesis: Ha: ρ ≠ 0 WHAT THE HYPOTHESES MEAN IN WORDS: • Null Hypothesis H0: The population correlation coefficient IS NOT significantly different from zero. There IS NOT a significant linear relationship(correlation) between x and y in the population. • Alternate Hypothesis Ha: The population correlation coefficient IS significantly DIFFERENT FROM zero. There IS A SIGNIFICANT LINEAR RELATIONSHIP (correlation) between x and y in the population. DRAWING A CONCLUSION: There are two methods of making the decision. The two methods are equivalent and give the same result. • Method 1: Using the p-value • Method 2: Using a table of critical values In this chapter of this textbook, we will always use a significance level of 5%, α = 0.05 NOTE Using the p-value method, you could choose any appropriate significance level you want; you are not limited to using α = 0.05. But the table of critical values provided in this textbook assumes that we are using a significance level of 5%, α = 0.05. (If we wanted to use a different significance level than 5% with the critical value method, we would need different tables of critical values that are not provided in this textbook.) METHOD 1: Using a p-value to make a decision To calculate the p-value using LinRegTTEST: On the LinRegTTEST input screen, on the line prompt for β or ρ, highlight \"≠ 0\" The output screen shows the p-value on the line that reads \"p =\". (Most computer statistical software can calculate the p-value.) 692 Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 If the p-value is less than the significance level (α = 0.05): • Decision: Reject the null hypothesis. • Conclusion: \"There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between x and y because the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero.\" If the p-value is NOT less than the significance level (α = 0.05) • Decision: DO NOT REJECT the null hypothesis. • Conclusion: \"There is insufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between x and y because the correlation coefficient is NOT significantly different from zero.\" You will use technology to calculate the p-value. The following describes the calculations to compute the test statistics and the p-value: The p-value is calculated using a t-distribution with n - 2 degrees of freedom. The formula for the test statistic is t =r n− 2 1 −r 2 . The value of the test statistic, t, is shown in the computer or calculator output along with the p-value. The test statistic t has the same sign as the correlation coefficient r. The p-value is the combined area in both tails. An alternative way to calculate the p-value (p) given by LinRegTTest is the command 2*tcdf(abs(t),10^99, n-2) in 2nd DISTR. THIRD-EXAM vs FINAL-EXAM EXAMPLE: p-value method • Consider the third exam/final exam example. • The line of best fit is: ŷ = -173.51 + 4.83x with r = 0.6631 and there are n = 11 data points. • Can the regression line be used for prediction? Given a third exam score (x value), can we use the line to predict the final exam score (predicted y value)? H0: ρ = 0 Ha: ρ ≠ 0 α = 0.05 • The p-value is 0.026 (from LinRegTTest on your calculator or from computer software). • The p-value, 0.026, is less than the significance level of α = 0.05. • Decision: Reject the Null Hypothesis H0 • Conclusion: There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between the third exam score (x) and the final exam score (y) because the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero. Because r is significant and the scatter plot shows a linear trend, the regression line can be used to predict final exam scores. METHOD 2: Using a table of Critical Values to make a decision The 95% Critical Values of the Sample Correlation Coefficient Table can be used to give you a good idea of whether the computed value of ris significant or not. Compare r to the appropriate critical value in the table. If r is not between the positive and negative critical values, then the correlation coefficient is significant. If r is significant, then you may want to use the line for prediction. Example 12.7 Suppose you computed r = 0.801 using n = 10 data points.df = n - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8. The critical values associated with df = 8 are -0.632 and + 0.632. If r < negative critical value or r > positive critical value, then r issignificant. Since r = 0.801 and 0.801 > 0.632, r is significant and the line may be usedfor prediction. If you view this example on a number line, it will help you. Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation 693 Figure 12.14 r is not significant between -0.632 and +0.632. r = 0.801 > +0.632. Therefore, r is significant. 12.7 For a given line of best fit, you computed that r = 0.6501 using n = 12 data points and the critical value is 0.576. Can the line be used for prediction? Why or why not? Example 12.8 Suppose you computed r = –0.624 with 14 data points. df = 14 – 2 = 12. The critical values are –0.532 and 0.532. Since –0.624 < –0.532, r is significant and the line can be used for prediction Figure 12.15 r = –0.624 < -0.532. Therefore, r is significant. 12.8 For a given line of best fit, you compute that r = 0.5204 using n = 9 data points, and the critical value is 0.666. Can the line be used for prediction? Why or why not? Example 12.9 Suppose you computed r = 0.776 and n = 6. df = 6 – 2 = 4. The critical values are –0.811 and 0.811. Since –0.811 < 0.776 < 0.811, r is not significant, and the line should not be used for prediction. Figure 12.16 -0.811 < r = 0.776 < 0.811. Therefore, r is not significant. 12.9 For a given line of best fit, you compute that r = –0.7204 using n = 8 data points, and the critical value is = 0.707. Can the line be used for prediction? Why or why not? 694 Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 THIRD-EXAM vs FINAL-EXAM EXAMPLE: critical value method Consider the third exam/final exam example. The line of best fit is: ŷ = –173.51+4.83x with r = 0.6631 and there are n = 11 data points. Can the regression line be used for prediction? Given a third-exam score (x value), can we use the line to predict the final exam score (predicted y value)? H0: ρ = 0 Ha: ρ ≠ 0 α = 0.05 • Use the \"95% Critical Value\" table for r with df = n – 2 = 11 – 2 = 9. • The critical values are –0.602 and +0.602 • Since 0.6631 > 0.602, r is significant. • Decision: Reject the null hypothesis. • Conclusion:There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between the third exam score (x) and the final exam score (y) because the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero. Because r is significant and the scatter plot shows a linear trend, the regression line can be used to predict final exam scores. Example 12.10 Suppose you computed the following correlation coefficients. Using the table at the end of the chapter, determine if r is significant and the line of best fit associated with each r can be used to predict a y value. If it helps, draw a number line. a. r = –0.567 and the sample size, n, is 19. The df = n – 2 = 17. The critical value is –0.456. –0.567 < –0.456 so r is significant. b. r = 0.708 and the sample size, n, is nine. The df = n – 2 = 7. The critical value is 0.666. 0.708 > 0.666 so r is significant. c. r = 0.134 and the sample size, n, is 14. The df = 14 – 2 = 12. The critical value is 0.532. 0.134 is between –0.532 and 0.532 so r is not significant. d. r = 0 and the sample size, n, is five. No matter what the dfs are, r = 0 is between the two critical values so r is not significant. 12.10 For a given line of best fit, you compute that r = 0 using n = 100 data points. Can the line be used for prediction? Why or why not? Assumptions in Testing the Significance of the Correlation Coefficient Testing the significance of the correlation coefficient requires that certain assumptions about the data are satisfied. The premise of this test is that the data are a sample of observed points taken from a larger population. We have not examined the entire population because it is not possible or feasible to do so. We are examining the sample to draw a conclusion about whether the linear relationship that we see between x and y in the sample data provides strong enough evidence so that we can conclude that there is a linear relationship between x and y in the population. The regression line equation that we calculate from the sample data gives the best-fit line for our particular sample. We want to use this best-fit line for the sample as an estimate of the best-fit line for the population. Examining the scatterplot and testing the significance of the correlation coefficient helps us determine if it is appropriate to do this. The assumptions underlying the test of significance are: • There is a linear relationship in the population that models the average value of y for varying values of x. In other words, the expected value of y for each particular value lies on a straight line in the population. (We do not know the Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation 695 equation for the line for the population. Our regression line from the sample is our best estimate of this line in the population.) • The y values for any particular x value are normally distributed about the line. This implies that there are more y values scattered closer to the line than are scattered farther away. Assumption (1) implies that these normal distributions are centered on the line: the means of these normal distributions of y values lie on the line. • The standard deviations of the population y values about the line are equal for each value of x. In other words, each of these normal distributions of y values has the same shape and spread about the line. • The residual errors are mutually independent (no pattern). • The data are produced from a well-designed, random sample or randomized experiment. Figure 12.17 The y values for each x value are normally distributed about the line with the same standard deviation. For each x value, the mean of the y values lies on the regression line. More y values lie near the line than are scattered further away from the line. 12.5 | Prediction Recall the third exam/final exam example. We examined the scatterplot and showed that the correlation coefficient is significant. We found the equation of the best-fit line for the final exam grade as a function of the grade on the third-exam. We can now use the least-squares regression line for prediction. Suppose you want to estimate, or predict, the mean final exam score of statistics students who received 73 on the third exam. The exam scores (x-values) range from 65 to 75. Since 73 is between the x-values 65 and 75, substitute x = 73 into the equation. Then: y^ = − 173.51 + 4.83(73) = 179.08 We predict that statistics students who earn a grade of 73 on the third exam will earn a grade of 179.08 on the final exam, on average. Example 12.11 Recall the third exam/final exam example. a. What would you predict the final exam score to be for a student who scored a 66 on the third exam? Solution 12.11 a. 145.27 b. What would you predict the final exam score to be for a student who scored a 90 on the third exam? 696 Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Solution 12.11 b. The x values in the data are between 65 and 75. Ninety is outside of the domain of the observed x values in the data (independent variable), so you cannot reliably predict the final exam score for this student. (Even though it is possible to enter 90 into the equation for x and calculate a corresponding y value, the y value that you get will not be reliable.) To understand really how unreliable the prediction can be outside of the observed x values observed in the data, make the substitution x = 90 into the equation. y ^ = –173.51 + 4.83 ⎛ ⎝90 ⎞ ⎠= 261.19 The final-exam score is predicted to be 261.19. The largest the final-exam score can be is 200. NOTE The process of predicting inside of the observed x values observed in the data is called interpolation. The process of predicting outside of the observed x values observed in the data is called extrapolation. 12.11 Data are collected on the relationship between the number of hours per week practicing a musical instrument and scores on a math test. The line of best fit is as follows: ŷ = 72.5 + 2.8x What would you predict the score on a math test would be for a student who practices a musical instrument for five hours a week? 12.6 | Outliers In some data sets, there are values (observed data points) called outliers. Outliers are observed data points that are far from the least squares line. They have large \"errors\", where the \"error\" or residual is the vertical distance from the line to the point. Outliers need to be examined closely. Sometimes, for some reason or another, they should not be included in the analysis of the data. It is possible that an outlier is a result of erroneous data. Other times, an outlier may hold valuable information about the population under study and should remain included in the data. The key is to examine carefully what causes a data point to be an outlier. Besides outliers, a sample may contain one or a few points that are called influential points. Influential points are observed data points that are far from the other observed data points in the horizontal direction. These points may have a big effect on the slope of the regression line. To begin to identify an influential point, you can remove it from the data set and see if the slope of the regression line is changed significantly. Computers and many calculators can be used to identify outliers from the data. Computer output for regression analysis will often identify both outliers and influential points so that you can examine them. Identifying Outliers We could guess at outliers by looking at a graph of the scatterplot and best fit-line. However, we would like some guideline as to how far away a point needs to be in order to be considered an outlier. As a rough rule of thumb, we can flag any point that is located further than two standard deviations above or below the best-fit line as an outlier. The standard deviation used is the standard deviation of the residuals or errors. We can do this visually in the scatter plot by drawing an extra pair of lines that are two standard deviations above and below the best-fit line. Any data points that are outside this extra pair of lines are flagged as potential outliers. Or we can do this Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation 697 numerically by calculating each residual and comparing it to twice the standard deviation. On the TI-83, 83+, or 84+, the graphical approach is easier. The graphical procedure is shown first, followed by the numerical calculations. You would generally need to use only one of these methods. Example 12.12 In the third exam/final exam example, you can determine if there is an outlier or not. If there is an outlier, as an exercise, delete it and fit the remaining data to a new line. For this example, the new line ought to fit the remaining data better. This means the SSE should be smaller and the correlation coefficient ought to be closer to 1 or –1. Solution 12.12 Graphical Identification of Outliers With the TI-83, 83+, 84+ graphing calculators, it is easy to identify the outliers graphically and visually. If we were to measure the vertical distance from any data point to the corresponding point on the line of best fit and that distance were equal to 2s or more, then we would consider the data point to be \"too far\" from the line of best fit. We need to find and graph the lines that are two standard deviations below and above the regression line. Any points that are outside these two lines are outliers. We will call these lines Y2 and Y3: As we did with the equation of the regression line and the correlation coefficient, we will use technology to calculate this standard deviation for us. Using the LinRegTTest with this data, scroll down through the output screens to find s = 16.412. Line Y2 = –173.5 + 4.83x –2(16.4) and line Y3 = –173.5 + 4.83x + 2(16.4) where ŷ = –173.5 + 4.83x is the line of best fit. Y2 and Y3 have the same slope as the line of best fit. Graph the scatterplot with the best fit line in equation Y1, then enter the two extra lines as Y2 and Y3 in the \"Y=\"equation editor and press ZOOM 9. You will find that the only data point that is not between lines Y2 and Y3 is the point x = 65, y = 175. On the calculator screen it is just barely outside these lines. The outlier is the student who had a grade of 65 on the third exam and 175 on the final exam; this point is further than two standard deviations away from the best-fit line. Sometimes a point is so close to the lines used to flag outliers on the graph that it is difficult to tell if the point is between or outside the lines. On a computer, enlarging the graph may help; on a small calculator screen, zooming in may make the graph clearer. Note that when the graph does not give a clear enough picture, you can use the numerical comparisons to identify outliers. Figure 12.18 698 Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 12.12 Identify the potential outlier in the scatter plot. The standard deviation of the residuals or errors is approximately 8.6. Figure 12.19 Numerical Identification of Outliers In Table 12.5, the first two columns are the third-exam and final-exam data. The third column shows the predicted ŷ values calculated from the line of best fit: ŷ = –173.5 + 4.83x. The residuals, or errors, have been calculated in the fourth column of the table: observed y value−predicted y value = y − ŷ. s is the standard deviation of all the y − ŷ = ε values where n = the total number of data points. If each residual is calculated and squared, and the results are added, we get the SSE. The standard deviation of the residuals is calculated from the SSE as: s= SSE n− 2 NOTE We divide by (n – 2) because the regression model involves two estimates. Rather than calculate the value of s ourselves, we can find s using the computer or calculator. For this example, the calculator function LinRegTTest found s = 16.4 as the standard deviation of the residuals 35; –17; 16; –6; –19; 9; 3; –1; –10; –9; –1. x y ŷ y – ŷ 65 175 140 175 – 140 = 35 67 133 150 133 – 150= –17 71 185 169 185 – 169 = 16 71 163 169 163 – 169 = –6 Table 12.5 Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation 699 x y ŷ y – ŷ 66 126 145 126 – 145 = –19 75 198 189 198 – 189 = 9 67 153 150 153 – 150 = 3 70 163 164 163 – 164 = –1 71 159 169 159 – 169 = –10 69 151 160 151 – 160 = –9 69 159 160 159 – 160 = –1 Table 12.5 We are looking for all data points for which the residual is greater than 2s = 2(16.4) = 32.8 or less than –32.8. Compare these values to the residuals in column four of the table. The only such data point is the student who had a grade of 65 on the third exam and 175 on the final exam; the residual for this student is 35. How does the outlier affect the best fit line? Numerically and graphically, we have identified the point (65, 175) as an outlier. We should re-examine the data for this point to see if there are any problems with the data. If there is an error, we should fix the error if possible, or delete the data. If the data is correct, we would leave it in the data set. For this problem, we will suppose that we examined the data and found that this outlier data was an error. Therefore we will continue on and delete the outlier, so that we can explore how it affects the results, as a learning experience. Compute a new best-fit line and correlation coefficient using the ten remaining points: On the TI-83, TI-83+, TI-84+ calculators, delete the outlier from L1 and L2. Using the LinRegTTest, the new line of best fit and the correlation coefficient are: ŷ = –355.19 + 7.39x and r = 0.9121 The new line with r = 0.9121 is a stronger correlation than the original (r = 0.6631) because r = 0.9121 is closer to one. This means that the new line is a better fit to the ten remaining data values. The line can better predict the final exam score given the third exam score. Numerical Identification of Outliers: Calculating s and Finding Outliers Manually If you do not have the function LinRegTTest, then you can calculate the outlier in the first example by doing the following. First, square each |y – ŷ| The squares are 352; 172; 162; 62; 192; 92; 32; 12; 102; 92; 12 Then, add (sum) all the |y – ŷ| squared terms using the formula Σ i = 1 11 ⎛ ⎝| yi−y^ i| ⎞ ⎠ 2 = Σ i = 1 11 εi 2(Recall that yi – ŷi = εi.) = 352 + 172 + 162 + 62 + 192 + 92 + 32 + 12 + 102 + 92 + 12 = 2440 = SSE. The result, SSE is the Sum of Squared Errors. Next, calculate s, the standard deviation of all the y – ŷ = ε values where n = the total number of data points. The calculation is s= SSE n– 2 . For the third exam/final exam problem, s= 2440 11 – 2 = 16.47. Next, multiply s by 2: (2)(16.47) = 32.94 700 Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 32.94 is 2 standard deviations away from the mean of the y – ŷ values. If we were to measure the vertical distance from any data point to the corresponding point on the line of best fit and that distance is at least 2s, then we would consider the data point to be \"too far\" from the line of best fit. We call that point a potential outlier. For the example, if any of the |y – ŷ| values are at least 32.94, the corresponding (x, y) data point is a potential outlier. For the third exam/final exam problem, all the |y – ŷ|'s are less than 31.29 except for the first one which is 35. 35 > 31.29 That is, |y – ŷ| ≥ (2)(s) The point which corresponds to |y – ŷ| = 35 is (65, 175). Therefore, the data point (65,175) is a potential outlier. For this example, we will delete it. (Remember, we do not always delete an outlier.) NOTE When outliers are deleted, the researcher should either record that data was deleted, and why, or the researcher should provide results both with and without the deleted data. If data is erroneous and the correct values are known (e.g., student one actually scored a 70 instead of a 65), then this correction can be made to the data. The next step is to compute a new best-fit line using the ten remaining points. The new line of best fit and the correlation coefficient are: ŷ = –355.19 + 7.39x and r = 0.9121 Example 12.13 Using this new line of best fit (based on the remaining ten data points in the third exam/final exam example), what would a student who receives a 73 on the third exam expect to receive on the final exam? Is this the same as the prediction made using the original line? Solution 12.13 Using the new line of best fit, ŷ = –355.19 + 7.39(73) = 184.28. A student who scored 73 points on the third exam would expect to earn 184 points on the final exam. The original line predicted ŷ = –173.51 + 4.83(73) = 179.08 so the prediction using the new line with the outlier eliminated differs from the original prediction. 12.13 The data points for the graph from the third exam/final exam example are as follows: (1, 5), (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 9), (4, 12), (4, 13), (5, 18), (6, 19), (7, 12), and (7, 21). Remove the outlier and recalculate the line of best fit. Find the value of ŷ when x = 10. Example 12.14 The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for consumer goods and services. The CPI affects nearly all Americans because of the many ways it is used. One of its biggest uses is as a measure of inflation. By providing information about price changes in the Nation's economy to government, business, and labor, the CPI helps them to make economic decisions. The President, Congress, and the Federal Reserve Board use the CPI's trends to formulate monetary and fiscal policies. In the following table, x is the year and y is the CPI. Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation 701 x y x y 1915 10.1 1969 36.7 1926 17.7 1975 49.3 1935 13.7 1979 72.6 1940 14.7 1980 82.4 1947 24.1 1986 109.6 1952 26.5 1991 130.7 1964 31.0 1999 166.6 Table 12.6 Data a.

The number of data points is n = 14. Use the 95% Critical Values of the Sample Correlation Coefficient table at the end of Chapter 12. n – 2 = 12. The corresponding critical value is 0.532. Since 0.8694 > 0.532, r is significant. ŷ = –3204 + 1.662(1990) = 103.4 CPI e. Using the calculator LinRegTTest, we find that s = 25.4 ; graphing the lines Y2 = –3204 + 1.662X – 2(25.4) and Y3 = –3204 + 1.662X + 2(25.4) shows that no data values are outside those lines, identifying no outliers. (Note that the year 1999 was very close to the upper line, but still inside it.) Figure 12.20 NOTE In the example, notice the pattern of the points compared to the line. Although the correlation coefficient is 702 Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 significant, the pattern in the scatterplot indicates that a curve would be a more appropriate model to use than a line. In this example, a statistician should prefer to use other methods to fit a curve to this data, rather than model the data with the line we found. In addition to doing the calculations, it is always important to look at the scatterplot when deciding whether a linear model is appropriate.

The coefficient cannot be more then 1 and less then –1. The closer the coefficient is to ±1, the stronger the evidence of a significant linear relationship between x and y. an observation that does not fit the rest of the data CHAPTER REVIEW 12.1 Linear Equations The most basic type of association is a linear association. This type of relationship can be defined algebraically by the equations used, numerically with actual or predicted data values, or graphically from a plotted curve. (Lines are classified as straight curves.) Algebraically, a linear equation typically takes the form y = mx + b, where m and b are constants, x is the independent variable, y is the dependent variable. In a statistical context, a linear equation is written in the form y = a + bx, where a and b are the constants. This form is used to help readers distinguish the statistical context from the algebraic context. In the equation y = a + bx, the constant b that multiplies the x variable (b is called a coefficient) is called as the slope. The slope describes the rate of change between the independent and dependent variables; in other words, the rate of change describes the change that occurs in the dependent variable as the independent variable is changed. In the equation y = a + bx, the constant a is called as the y-intercept. Graphically, the y-intercept is the y coordinate of the point where the graph of the line crosses the y axis. At this point x = 0. The slope of a line is a value that describes the rate of change between the independent and dependent variables. The slope tells us how the dependent variable (y) changes for every one unit increase in the independent (x) variable, on average. The y-intercept is used to describe the dependent variable when the independent variable equals zero. Graphically, the slope is represented by three line types in elementary statistics. 12.2 Scatter Plots Scatter plots are particularly helpful graphs when we want to see if there is a linear relationship among data points. They indicate both the direction of the relationship between the x variables and the y variables, and the strength of the relationship. We calculate the strength of the relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable using linear regression. 12.3 The Regression Equation A regression line, or a line of best fit, can be drawn on a scatter plot and used to predict outcomes for the x and y variables in a given data set or sample data. There are several ways to find a regression line, but usually the least-squares regression line is used because it creates a uniform line. Residuals, also called “errors,” measure the distance from the actual value of y and the estimated value of y. The Sum of Squared Errors, when set to its minimum, calculates the points on the line of best fit. Regression lines can be used to predict values within the given set of data, but should not be used to make predictions for values outside the set of data. The correlation coefficient r measures the strength of the linear association between x and y. The variable r has to be between –1 and +1. When r is positive, the x and y will tend to increase and decrease together. When r is negative, x will increase and y will decrease, or the opposite, x will decrease and y will increase. The coefficient of determination r2, is equal to the square of the correlation coefficient. When expressed as a percent, r2 represents the percent of variation in the dependent variable y that can be explained by variation in the independent variable x using the regression line. 12.4 Testing the Significance of the Correlation Coefficient Linear regression is a procedure for fitting a straight line of the form ŷ = a + bx to data. The conditions for regression are: • Linear In the population, there is a linear relationship that models the average value of y for different values of x. • Independent The residuals are assumed to be independent. Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation 711 • Normal The y values are distributed normally for any value of x. • Equal variance The standard deviation of the y values is equal for each x value. • Random The data are produced from a well-designed random sample or randomized experiment. The slope b and intercept a of the least-squares line estimate the slope β and intercept α of the population (true) regression line. To estimate the population standard deviation of y, σ, use the standard deviation of the residuals, s. s= SEE n− 2 . The variable ρ (rho) is the population correlation coefficient. To test the null hypothesis H0: ρ = hypothesized value, use a linear regression t-test. The most common null hypothesis is H0: ρ = 0 which indicates there is no linear relationship between x and y in the population. The TI-83, 83+, 84, 84+ calculator function LinRegTTest can perform this test (STATS TESTS LinRegTTest). 12.5 Prediction After determining the presence of a strong correlation coefficient and calculating the line of best fit, you can use the least squares regression line to make predictions about your data. 12.6 Outliers To determine if a point is an outlier, do one of the following: 1. Input the following equations into the TI 83, 83+,84, 84+: y1=a + bx y2=a + bx+ 2s y3=a + bx− 2s where s is the standard deviation of the residuals If any point is above y2 or below y3 then the point is considered to be an outlier. 2. Use the residuals and compare their absolute values to 2s where s is the standard deviation of the residuals. If the absolute value of any residual is greater than or equal to 2s, then the corresponding point is an outlier. 3. Note: The calculator function LinRegTTest (STATS TESTS LinRegTTest) calculates s.

At the start of the cleaning, the company charges a one-time fee of $50 (this is when x = 0). The slope is 100 (b = 100). For each session, the company charges $100 for each hour they clean. 13 12,000 pounds of soil 15 The slope is –1.5 (b = –1.5). This means the stock is losing value at a rate of $1.50 per hour.

When x = 1985, ŷ = 25,52 b. When x = 1990, ŷ = 34,275 c. When x = 1970, ŷ = –725 Why doesn’t this answer make sense? The range of x values was 1981 to 2002; the year 1970 is not in this range. The regression equation does not apply, because predicting for the year 1970 is extrapolation, which requires a different process. Also, a negative number does not make sense in this context, where we are predicting flu cases diagnosed. 41 Also, the correlation r = 0.4526. If r is compared to the value in the 95% Critical Values of the Sample Correlation Coefficient Table, because r > 0.423, r is significant, and you would think that the line could be used for prediction. But the scatter plot indicates otherwise. 43 y^ = 3,448,225 + 1750x 45 There was an increase in flu cases diagnosed until 1993. From 1993 through 2002, the number of flu cases diagnosed declined each year. It is not appropriate to use a linear regression line to fit to the data. 47 Since there is no linear association between year and # of flu cases diagnosed, it is not appropriate to calculate a linear correlation coefficient. When there is a linear association and it is appropriate to calculate a correlation, we cannot say that one variable “causes” the other variable. 49 We don’t know if the pre-1981 data was collected from a single year.

The correlation coefficient r = –0.57874 is not less than –0.811, so we do not reject the null hypothesis. e.

The slope of the regression line is -0.3031 with a y-intercept of 31.93. In context, the y-intercept indicates that when there are no returning sparrow hawks, there will be almost 32% new sparrow hawks, which doesn’t make sense since if there are no returning birds, then the new percentage would have to be 100% (this is an example of why we do not extrapolate). The slope tells us that for each percentage increase in returning birds, the Chapter 12 | Linear Regression and Correlation 737 percentage of new birds in the colony decreases by 30.3%. d. If we examine r2, we see that only 57.52% of the variation in the percent of new birds is explained by the model and the correlation coefficient, r = –.7584 only indicates a somewhat strong correlation between returning and new percentages. e. The ordered pair (66, 6) generates the largest residual of 6.0. This means that when the observed return percentage is 66%, our observed new percentage, 6%, is almost 6% less than the predicted new value of 11.98%. If we remove this data pair, we see only an adjusted slope of -.2789 and an adjusted intercept of 30.9816. In other words, even though this data generates the largest residual, it is not an outlier, nor is the data pair an influential point. f. If there are 70% returning birds, we would expect to see y = –.2789(70) + 30.9816 = 0.114 or 11.4% new birds in the colony. 75 a. Check student’s solution. b. Check student’s solution. c. We have a slope of –1.4946 with a y-intercept of 193.88. The slope, in context, indicates that for each additional minute added to the swim time, the heart rate will decrease by 1.5 beats per minute. If the student is not swimming at all, the y-intercept indicates that his heart rate will be 193.88 beats per minute. While the slope has meaning (the longer it takes to swim 2,000 meters, the less effort the heart puts out), the y-intercept does not make sense. If the athlete is not swimming (resting), then his heart rate should be very low. d. Since only 1.5% of the heart rate variation is explained by this regression equation, we must conclude that this association is not explained with a linear relationship. e. The point (34.72, 124) generates the largest residual of –11.82. This means that our observed heart rate is almost 12 beats less than our predicted rate of 136 beats per minute. When this point is removed, the slope becomes –2.953 with the y-intercept changing to 247.1616. While the linear association is still very weak, we see that the removed data pair can be considered an influential point in the sense that the y-intercept becomes more meaningful. 77 If we remove the two service academies (the tuition is $0.00), we construct a new regression equation of y = –0.0009x + 160 with a correlation coefficient of 0.71397 and a coefficient of determination of 0.50976. This allows us to say there is a fairly strong linear association between tuition costs and salaries if the service academies are removed from the data set. 79 a.

Introduction Chapter Objectives By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to: • Interpret the F probability distribution as the number of groups and the sample size change. • Discuss two uses for the F distribution: one-way ANOVA and the test of two variances. • Conduct and interpret one-way ANOVA. • Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests of two variances. Many statistical applications in psychology, social science, business administration, and the natural sciences involve several groups. For example, an environmentalist is interested in knowing if the average amount of pollution varies in several bodies of water. A sociologist is interested in knowing if the amount of income a person earns varies according to his or her Chapter 13 | F Distribution and One-Way ANOVA 743 upbringing. A consumer looking for a new car might compare the average gas mileage of several models. For hypothesis tests comparing averages between more than two groups, statisticians have developed a method called \"Analysis of Variance\" (abbreviated ANOVA). In this chapter, you will study the simplest form of ANOVA called single factor or one-way ANOVA. You will also study the F distribution, used for one-way ANOVA, and the test of two variances. This is just a very brief overview of one-way ANOVA. You will study this topic in much greater detail in future statistics courses. One-Way ANOVA, as it is presented here, relies heavily on a calculator or computer. 13.1 | One-Way ANOVA The purpose of a one-way ANOVA test is to determine the existence of a statistically significant difference among several group means. The test actually uses variances to help determine if the means are equal or not. In order to perform a one- way ANOVA test, there are five basic assumptions to be fulfilled: 1. Each population from which a sample is taken is assumed to be normal. 2. All samples are randomly selected and independent. 3. The populations are assumed to have equal standard deviations (or variances). 4. The factor is a categorical variable. 5. The response is a numerical variable. The Null and Alternative Hypotheses The null hypothesis is simply that all the group population means are the same. The alternative hypothesis is that at least one pair of means is different. For example, if there are k groups: H0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3 = ... = μk Ha: At least two of the group means μ1, μ2, μ3, ..., μk are not equal. That is, μi ≠ μj for some i ≠ j. The graphs, a set of box plots representing the distribution of values with the group means indicated by a horizontal line through the box, help in the understanding of the hypothesis test. In the first graph (red box plots), H0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3 and the three populations have the same distribution if the null hypothesis is true. The variance of the combined data is approximately the same as the variance of each of the populations. If the null hypothesis is false, then the variance of the combined data is larger which is caused by the different means as shown in the second graph (green box plots). Figure 13.2 (a) H0 is true. All means are the same; the differences are due to random variation. (b) H0 is not true. All means are not the same; the differences are too large to be due to random variation. 744 Chapter 13 | F Distribution and One-Way ANOVA This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 13.2 | The F Distribution and the F-Ratio The distribution used for the hypothesis test is a new one. It is called the F distribution, named after Sir Ronald Fisher, an English statistician. The F statistic is a ratio (a fraction). There are two sets of degrees of freedom; one for the numerator and one for the denominator. For example, if F follows an F distribution and the number of degrees of freedom for the numerator is four, and the number of degrees of freedom for the denominator is ten, then F ~ F4,10. NOTE The F distribution is derived from the Student's t-distribution. The values of the F distribution are squares of the corresponding values of the t-distribution. One-Way ANOVA expands the t-test for comparing more than two groups. The scope of that derivation is beyond the level of this course. It is preferable to use ANOVA when there are more than two groups instead of performing pairwise t-tests because performing multiple tests introduces the likelihood of making a Type 1 error. To calculate the F ratio, two estimates of the variance are made. 1. Variance between samples: An estimate of σ2 that is the variance of the sample means multiplied by n (when the sample sizes are the same.). If the samples are different sizes, the variance between samples is weighted to account for the different sample sizes. The variance is also called variation due to treatment or explained variation. 2. Variance within samples: An estimate of σ2 that is the average of the sample variances (also known as a pooled variance). When the sample sizes are different, the variance within samples is weighted. The variance is also called the variation due to error or unexplained variation. • SSbetween = the sum of squares that represents the variation among the different samples • SSwithin = the sum of squares that represents the variation within samples that is due to chance. To find a \"sum of squares\" means to add together squared quantities that, in some cases, may be weighted. We used sum of squares to calculate the sample variance and the sample standard deviation in Descriptive Statistics. MS means \" mean square.\" MSbetween is the variance between groups, and MSwithin is the variance within groups. Calculation of Sum of Squares and Mean Square • k = the number of different groups • nj = the size of the jth group • sj = the sum of the values in the jth group • n = total number of all the values combined (total sample size: ∑nj) • x = one value: ∑x = ∑sj • Sum of squares of all values from every group combined: ∑x2 • Between group variability: SStotal = ∑x2 – ⎛ ⎝∑ x 2⎞ ⎠ n • Total sum of squares: ∑x2 – ⎛ ⎝∑ x ⎞ ⎠ 2 n • Explained variation: sum of squares representing variation among the different samples: SSbetween = ∑ ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ (sj) 2 nj ⎤ ⎦ ⎥− (∑sj) 2 n • Unexplained variation: sum of squares representing variation within samples due to chance: SSwithin=SStotal–SSbetween • df's for different groups (df's for the numerator): df = k – 1 • Equation for errors within samples (df's for the denominator): dfwithin = n – k Chapter 13 | F Distribution and One-Way ANOVA 745 • Mean square (variance estimate) explained by the different groups: MSbetween = SSbetween d fbetween • Mean square (variance estimate) that is due to chance (unexplained): MSwithin = SSwithin d fwithin MSbetween and MSwithin can be written as follows: • MSbetween=SSbetween d fbetween =SSbetween k − 1 • MSwithin=SSwithin d fwithin =SSwithin n−k The one-way ANOVA test depends on the fact that MSbetween can be influenced by population differences among means of the several groups. Since MSwithin compares values of each group to its own group mean, the fact that group means might be different does not affect MSwithin. The null hypothesis says that all groups are samples from populations having the same normal distribution. The alternate hypothesis says that at least two of the sample groups come from populations with different normal distributions. If the null hypothesis is true, MSbetween and MSwithin should both estimate the same value. NOTE The null hypothesis says that all the group population means are equal. The hypothesis of equal means implies that the populations have the same normal distribution, because it is assumed that the populations are normal and that they have equal variances. F-Ratio or F Statistic F=MSbetween MSwithin If MSbetween and MSwithin estimate the same value (following the belief that H0 is true), then the F-ratio should be approximately equal to one. Mostly, just sampling errors would contribute to variations away from one. As it turns out, MSbetween consists of the population variance plus a variance produced from the differences between the samples. MSwithin is an estimate of the population variance. Since variances are always positive, if the null hypothesis is false, MSbetween will generally be larger than MSwithin.Then the F-ratio will be larger than one. However, if the population effect is small, it is not unlikely that MSwithin will be larger in a given sample. The foregoing calculations were done with groups of different sizes. If the groups are the same size, the calculations simplify somewhat and the F-ratio can be written as: F-Ratio Formula when the groups are the same size F=n⋅ s x¯ 2 s 2 pooled where ... • n = the sample size • dfnumerator = k – 1 • dfdenominator = n – k • s2 pooled = the mean of the sample variances (pooled variance) • s x¯ 2= the variance of the sample means Data are typically put into a table for easy viewing. One-Way ANOVA results are often displayed in this manner by computer software. 746 Chapter 13 | F Distribution and One-Way ANOVA This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Source of Variation Sum of Squares (SS) Degrees of Freedom (df) Mean Square (MS) F Factor (Between) SS(Factor) k – 1 MS(Factor) = SS(Factor)/(k – 1) F = MS(Factor)/MS(Error) Error (Within) SS(Error) n – k MS(Error) = SS(Error)/(n – k) Total SS(Total) n – 1 Table 13.1 Example 13.1 Three different diet plans are to be tested for mean weight loss.

Groups of three plants each had one of the following treatments • bare soil • a commercial ground cover • black plastic • straw • compost All plants grew under the same conditions and were the same variety. Students recorded the weight (in grams) of tomatoes produced by each of the n = 15 plants: Bare: n1 = 3 Ground Cover: n2 = 3 Plastic: n3 = 3 Straw: n4 = 3 Compost: n5 = 3 2,625 5,348 6,583 7,285 6,277 2,997 5,682 8,560 6,897 7,818 4,915 5,482 3,830 9,230 8,677 Table 13.4 Create the one-way ANOVA table. The one-way ANOVA hypothesis test is always right-tailed because larger F-values are way out in the right tail of the F-distribution curve and tend to make us reject H0. Notation The notation for the F distribution is F ~ Fdf(num),df(denom) where df(num) = dfbetween and df(denom) = dfwithin The mean for the F distribution is µ = d f (denom) d f (denom) – 2 13.3 | Facts About the F Distribution Here are some facts about the F distribution. 1. The curve is not symmetrical but skewed to the right. 2. There is a different curve for each set of dfs. 3. The F statistic is greater than or equal to zero. 4. As the degrees of freedom for the numerator and for the denominator get larger, the curve approximates the normal. 5. Other uses for the F distribution include comparing two variances and two-way Analysis of Variance. Two-Way Analysis is beyond the scope of this chapter. Chapter 13 | F Distribution and One-Way ANOVA 749 Figure 13.3 Example 13.2 Let’s return to the slicing tomato exercise in Try It. The means of the tomato yields under the five mulching conditions are represented by μ1, μ2, μ3, μ4, μ5. We will conduct a hypothesis test to determine if all means are the same or at least one is different. Using a significance level of 5%, test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in mean yields among the five groups against the alternative hypothesis that at least one mean is different from the rest. Solution 13.2 The null and alternative hypotheses are: H0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3 = μ4 = μ5 Ha: μi ≠ μj some i ≠ j The one-way ANOVA results are shown in Figure 13.50 Source of Variation Sum of Squares (SS) Degrees of Freedom (df) Mean Square (MS) F Factor (Between) 36,648,561 5 – 1 = 4 36,648,561 4 = 9,162,140 9,162,140 2,044,672.6 = 4.4810 Error (Within) 20,446,726 15 – 5 = 10 20,446,726 10 = 2,044,672.6 Total 57,095,287 15 – 1 = 14 Table 13.5 Distribution for the test: F4,10 df(num) = 5 – 1 = 4 df(denom) = 15 – 5 = 10 Test statistic: F = 4.4810 750 Chapter 13 | F Distribution and One-Way ANOVA This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Figure 13.4 Probability Statement: p-value = P(F > 4.481) = 0.0248. Compare α and the p-value: α = 0.05, p-value = 0.0248 Make a decision: Since α > p-value, we reject H0. Conclusion: At the 5% significance level, we have reasonably strong evidence that differences in mean yields for slicing tomato plants grown under different mulching conditions are unlikely to be due to chance alone. We may conclude that at least some of mulches led to different mean yields. To find these results on the calculator: Press STAT. Press 1:EDIT. Put the data into the lists L1, L2, L3, L4, L5.

Solution 13.3 Let μ1, μ2, μ3, μ4 be the population means of the sororities. Remember that the null hypothesis claims that the sorority groups are from the same normal distribution. The alternate hypothesis says that at least two of the sorority groups come from populations with different normal distributions. Notice that the four sample sizes are each five. NOTE This is an example of a balanced design, because each factor (i.e., sorority) has the same number of observations. H0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3 = μ4 Ha: Not all of the means μ1, μ2, μ3, μ4 are equal.

Tommy chose to grow his bean plants in soil found outside his classroom mixed with dryer lint. Tara chose to grow her bean plants in potting soil bought at the local nursery. Nick chose to grow his bean plants in soil from his mother's garden. No chemicals were used on the plants, only water. They were grown inside the classroom next to a large window. Each child grew five plants. At the end of the growing period, each plant was measured, 754 Chapter 13 | F Distribution and One-Way ANOVA This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 producing the data (in inches) in Table 13.9.

Test at a 3% level of significance. Solution 13.4 This time, we will perform the calculations that lead to the F' statistic. Notice that each group has the same number of plants, so we will use the formula F' = n⋅ s x¯ 2 s 2 pooled . First, calculate the sample mean and sample variance of each group. Tommy's Plants Tara's Plants Nick's Plants Sample Mean 24.2 25.4 24.4 Sample Variance 11.7 18.3 16.3 Table 13.10 Next, calculate the variance of the three group means (Calculate the variance of 24.2, 25.4, and 24.4). Variance of the group means = 0.413 = s x¯ 2 Then MSbetween = ns x¯ 2= (5)(0.413) where n = 5 is the sample size (number of plants each child grew). Calculate the mean of the three sample variances (Calculate the mean of 11.7, 18.3, and 16.3). Mean of the sample variances = 15.433 = s2 pooled Then MSwithin = s2pooled = 15.433. The F statistic (or F ratio) is F=MSbetween MSwithin = ns x¯ 2 s 2 pooled =(5)(0.413) 15.433 = 0.134 The dfs for the numerator = the number of groups – 1 = 3 – 1 = 2. The dfs for the denominator = the total number of samples – the number of groups = 15 – 3 = 12 The distribution for the test is F2,12 and the F statistic is F = 0.134 The p-value is P(F > 0.134) = 0.8759. Decision: Since α = 0.03 and the p-value = 0.8759, do not reject H0. (Why?) Conclusion: With a 3% level of significance, from the sample data, the evidence is not sufficient to conclude that the mean heights of the bean plants are different.

The heights were (in inches) 24, 28, 25, 30, and 32. Do a one-way ANOVA test on the four groups. Are the heights of the bean plants different? Use the same method as shown in Example 13.4. From the class, create four groups of the same size as follows: men under 22, men at least 22, women under 22, women at least 22. Have each member of each group record the number of states in the United States he or she has visited. Run an ANOVA test to determine if the average number of states visited in the four groups are the same. Test at a 1% level of significance. Use one of the solution sheets in Appendix E. 13.4 | Test of Two Variances Another of the uses of the F distribution is testing two variances. It is often desirable to compare two variances rather than two averages. For instance, college administrators would like two college professors grading exams to have the same variation in their grading. In order for a lid to fit a container, the variation in the lid and the container should be the same. A supermarket might be interested in the variability of check-out times for two checkers. In order to perform a F test of two variances, it is important that the following are true: 1. The populations from which the two samples are drawn are normally distributed. 2. The two populations are independent of each other. Unlike most other tests in this book, the F test for equality of two variances is very sensitive to deviations from normality. If the two distributions are not normal, the test can give higher p-values than it should, or lower ones, in ways that are unpredictable. Many texts suggest that students not use this test at all, but in the interest of completeness we include it here. Suppose we sample randomly from two independent normal populations. Let σ1 2and σ2 2be the population variances and s1 2and s2 2be the sample variances. Let the sample sizes be n1 and n2. Since we are interested in comparing the two sample variances, we use the F ratio: 756 Chapter 13 | F Distribution and One-Way ANOVA This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 F= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ (s1)2 (σ1)2 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ (s2)2 (σ2)2 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ F has the distribution F ~ F(n1 – 1, n2 – 1) where n1 – 1 are the degrees of freedom for the numerator and n2 – 1 are the degrees of freedom for the denominator. If the null hypothesis is σ1 2=σ2 2, then the F Ratio becomes F= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ (s1)2 (σ1)2 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ (s2)2 (σ2)2 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ =(s1) 2 (s2) 2. NOTE The F ratio could also be (s2) 2 (s1) 2. It depends on Ha and on which sample variance is larger. If the two populations have equal variances, then s1 2and s2 2are close in value and F=(s1) 2 (s2) 2 is close to one. But if the two population variances are very different, s1 2and s2 2tend to be very different, too. Choosing s1 2as the larger sample variance causes the ratio (s1) 2 (s2) 2 to be greater than one. If s1 2and s2 2are far apart, then F=(s1) 2 (s2) 2 is a large number. Therefore, if F is close to one, the evidence favors the null hypothesis (the two population variances are equal). But if F is much larger than one, then the evidence is against the null hypothesis. A test of two variances may be left, right, or two-tailed. Example 13.5 Two college instructors are interested in whether or not there is any variation in the way they grade math exams. They each grade the same set of 30 exams. The first instructor's grades have a variance of 52.3. The second instructor's grades have a variance of 89.9. Test the claim that the first instructor's variance is smaller. (In most colleges, it is desirable for the variances of exam grades to be nearly the same among instructors.) The level of significance is 10%. Solution 13.5 Let 1 and 2 be the subscripts that indicate the first and second instructor, respectively. n1 = n2 = 30. H0: σ1 2=σ2 2and Ha: σ1 2 < σ2 2 Calculate the test statistic: By the null hypothesis (σ1 2 = σ2 2), the F statistic is: F= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ (s1)2 (σ1)2 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ (s2)2 (σ2)2 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ =(s1) 2 (s2) 2=52.3 89.9 = 0.5818 Distribution for the test: F29,29 where n1 – 1 = 29 and n2 – 1 = 29.

Conclusion: With a 10% level of significance, from the data, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the variance in grades for the first instructor is smaller.

Chapter 13 | F Distribution and One-Way ANOVA 761 Analysis of Variance One-Way ANOVA Variance KEY TERMS also referred to as ANOVA, is a method of testing whether or not the means of three or more populations are equal. The method is applicable if: • all populations of interest are normally distributed. • the populations have equal standard deviations. • samples (not necessarily of the same size) are randomly and independently selected from each population. The test statistic for analysis of variance is the F-ratio. a method of testing whether or not the means of three or more populations are equal; the method is applicable if: • all populations of interest are normally distributed. • the populations have equal standard deviations. • samples (not necessarily of the same size) are randomly and independently selected from each population. • there is one independent variable and one dependent variable. The test statistic for analysis of variance is the F-ratio. mean of the squared deviations from the mean; the square of the standard deviation. For a set of data, a deviation can be represented as x – x¯ where x is a value of the data and x¯ is the sample mean. The sample variance is equal to the sum of the squares of the deviations divided by the difference of the sample size and one. CHAPTER REVIEW 13.1 One-Way ANOVA Analysis of variance extends the comparison of two groups to several, each a level of a categorical variable (factor). Samples from each group are independent, and must be randomly selected from normal populations with equal variances. We test the null hypothesis of equal means of the response in every group versus the alternative hypothesis of one or more group means being different from the others. A one-way ANOVA hypothesis test determines if several population means are equal. The distribution for the test is the F distribution with two different degrees of freedom. Assumptions: 1. Each population from which a sample is taken is assumed to be normal. 2. All samples are randomly selected and independent. 3. The populations are assumed to have equal standard deviations (or variances). 13.2 The F Distribution and the F-Ratio Analysis of variance compares the means of a response variable for several groups. ANOVA compares the variation within each group to the variation of the mean of each group. The ratio of these two is the F statistic from an F distribution with (number of groups – 1) as the numerator degrees of freedom and (number of observations – number of groups) as the denominator degrees of freedom. These statistics are summarized in the ANOVA table. 13.3 Facts About the F Distribution The graph of the F distribution is always positive and skewed right, though the shape can be mounded or exponential depending on the combination of numerator and denominator degrees of freedom. The F statistic is the ratio of a measure of the variation in the group means to a similar measure of the variation within the groups. If the null hypothesis is correct, then the numerator should be small compared to the denominator. A small F statistic will result, and the area under the F curve to the right will be large, representing a large p-value. When the null hypothesis of equal group means is incorrect, then the numerator should be large compared to the denominator, giving a large F statistic and a small area (small p-value) to the right of the statistic under the F curve. When the data have unequal group sizes (unbalanced data), then techniques from Section 13.2 need to be used for hand 762 Chapter 13 | F Distribution and One-Way ANOVA This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 calculations. In the case of balanced data (the groups are the same size) however, simplified calculations based on group means and variances may be used. In practice, of course, software is usually employed in the analysis. As in any analysis, graphs of various sorts should be used in conjunction with numerical techniques. Always look of your data! 13.4 Test of Two Variances The F test for the equality of two variances rests heavily on the assumption of normal distributions. The test is unreliable if this assumption is not met. If both distributions are normal, then the ratio of the two sample variances is distributed as an F statistic, with numerator and denominator degrees of freedom that are one less than the samples sizes of the corresponding two groups. A test of two variances hypothesis test determines if two variances are the same. The distribution for the hypothesis test is the F distribution with two different degrees of freedom. Assumptions: 1. The populations from which the two samples are drawn are normally distributed. 2. The two populations are independent of each other.

DDT is a pesticide that has been banned from use in the United States and most other areas of the world. It is quite effective, but persisted in the environment and over time became seen as harmful to higher-level organisms. Famously, egg shells of eagles and other raptors were believed to be thinner and prone to breakage in the nest because of ingestion of DDT in the food chain of the birds. An experiment was conducted on the number of eggs (fecundity) laid by female fruit flies. There are three groups of flies. One group was bred to be resistant to DDT (the RS group). Another was bred to be especially susceptible to DDT (SS). Finally there was a control line of non-selected or typical fruitflies (NS). Here are the data: RS SS NS RS SS NS 12.8 38.4 35.4 22.4 23.1 22.6 21.6 32.9 27.4 27.5 29.4 40.4 14.8 48.5 19.3 20.3 16 34.4 23.1 20.9 41.8 38.7 20.1 30.4 34.6 11.6 20.3 26.4 23.3 14.9 19.7 22.3 37.6 23.7 22.9 51.8 22.6 30.2 36.9 26.1 22.5 33.8 29.6 33.4 37.3 29.5 15.1 37.9 16.4 26.7 28.2 38.6 31 29.5 20.3 39 23.4 44.4 16.9 42.4 29.3 12.8 33.7 23.2 16.1 36.6 14.9 14.6 29.2 23.6 10.8 47.4 27.3 12.2 41.7 Table 13.29 The values are the average number of eggs laid daily for each of 75 flies (25 in each group) over the first 14 days of their lives. Using a 1% level of significance, are the mean rates of egg selection for the three strains of fruitfly different? If so, in what way? Specifically, the researchers were interested in whether or not the selectively bred strains were different from the nonselected line, and whether the two selected lines were different from each other. Here is a chart of the three groups: Figure 13.9 Chapter 13 | F Distribution and One-Way ANOVA 773 74.

Thirty men in college were taught a method of finger tapping. They were randomly assigned to three groups of ten, with each receiving one of three doses of caffeine: 0 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg. This is approximately the amount in no, one, or two cups of coffee. Two hours after ingesting the caffeine, the men had the rate of finger tapping per minute recorded. The experiment was double blind, so neither the recorders nor the students knew which group they were in. Does caffeine affect the rate of tapping, and if so how?

King Manuel I, Komnenus ruled the Byzantine Empire from Constantinople (Istanbul) during the years 1145 to 1180 A.D. The empire was very powerful during his reign, but declined significantly afterwards. Coins minted during his era were found in Cyprus, an island in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Nine coins were from his first coinage, seven from the second, four from the third, and seven from a fourth. These spanned most of his reign. We have data on the silver content of the coins: First Coinage Second Coinage Third Coinage Fourth Coinage 5.9 6.9 4.9 5.3 6.8 9.0 5.5 5.6 6.4 6.6 4.6 5.5 7.0 8.1 4.5 5.1 6.6 9.3 6.2 7.7 9.2 5.8 7.2 8.6 5.8 6.9 6.2 Table 13.36 Did the silver content of the coins change over the course of Manuel’s reign?

The American League and the National League of Major League Baseball are each divided into three divisions: East, Central, and West. Many years, fans talk about some divisions being stronger (having better teams) than other divisions. This may have consequences for the postseason. For instance, in 2012 Tampa Bay won 90 games and did not play in the postseason, while Detroit won only 88 and did play in the postseason. This may have been an oddity, but is there good evidence that in the 2012 season, the American League divisions were significantly different in overall records? Use the following data to test whether the mean number of wins per team in the three American League divisions were the same or not. Note that the data are not balanced, as two divisions had five teams, while one had only four.

There do not appear to be any serious outliers, so we may proceed with our ANOVA calculations, to see if we have good evidence of a difference between the three groups. H0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3; Ha: μi ≠ μj some i ≠ j. Define μ1, μ2, μ3, as the population mean number of eggs laid by the three groups of fruit flies. F statistic = 8.6657; p-value = 0.0004 Figure 13.10 Decision: Since the p-value is less than the level of significance of 0.01, we reject the null hypothesis. Conclusion: We have good evidence that the average number of eggs laid during the first 14 days of life for these three strains of fruitflies are different. Interestingly, if you perform a two sample t-test to compare the RS and NS groups they are significantly different (p = 0.0013). Similarly, SS and NS are significantly different (p = 0.0006). However, the two selected groups, RS and SS are not significantly different (p = 0.5176). Thus we appear to have good evidence that selection either for resistance or for susceptibility involves a reduced rate of egg production (for these specific strains) as compared to flies that were not selected for resistance or susceptibility to DDT. Here, genetic selection has apparently involved a loss of fecundity. 75 a. H0: σ1 2=σ2 2 b. Ha : σ1 2≠σ1 2 c. df(num) = 4; df(denom) = 4 d.

Figure 13.12 While the spread seems similar, there may be some question about the normality of the data, given the wide gaps in the middle near the 0.500 mark of 82 games (teams play 162 games each season in MLB). However, one-way ANOVA is robust. Here is the ANOVA table for the data: Source of Variation Sum of Squares (SS) Degrees of Freedom (df) Mean Square (MS) F Factor (Between) 344.16 3 – 1 = 2 172.08 Error (Within) 1,219.55 14 – 3 = 11 110.87 1.5521 Total 1,563.71 14 – 1 = 13 Table 13.42 P(F > 1.5521) = 0.2548 Since the p-value is so large, there is not good evidence against the null hypothesis of equal means. We decline to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, for 2012, there is not any have any good evidence of a significant difference in mean number of wins between the divisions of the American League.

Answers will vary. Sample Answer: Any solution in which you use data from the entire population is acceptable. For instance, a professor might calculate the average exam score for her class: because the scores of all members of the class were used in the calculation, the average is a parameter. 7. b 8. a 9. # of years Frequency Relative Frequency Cumulative Relative Frequency < 5 25 0.25 0.25 5–10 30 0.30 0.55 > 10 45 0.45 1.00 Table B3 10. 0.75 11. 0.55 12. Answers will vary. Sample Answer: One possibility is to obtain the class roster and assign each student a number from 1 to 200. Then use a random number generator or table of random number to generate 30 numbers between 1 and 200, and select the students matching the random numbers. It would also be acceptable to write each student’s name on a card, shuffle them in a box, and draw 30 names at random. 13. One possibility would be to obtain a roster of students enrolled in the college, including the class standing for each student. Then you would draw a proportionate random sample from within each class (for instance, if 30 percent of the students in the college are freshman, then 30 percent of your sample would be drawn from the freshman class). 14. For the first person picked, the chance of any individual being selected is one in 150. For the second person, it is one in 149, for the third it is one in 148, and so on. For the 30th person selected, the chance of selection is one in 121. 15. a 16. No. There are at least two chances for bias. First, the viewers of this particular program may not be representative of American football fans as a whole. Second, the sample will be self-selected, because people have to make a phone call in Appendix B 819 order to take part, and those people are probably not representative of the American football fan population as a whole. 17. These results (84 percent in one sample, 86 percent in the other) are probably due to sampling variability. Each researcher drew a different sample of children, and you would not expect them to get exactly the same result, although you would expect the results to be similar, as they are in this case. 18. No. The improvement could also be due to self-selection: only motivated students were willing to sign the contract, and they would have done well even in a school with 6.5 hour days. Because both changes were implemented at the same time, it is not possible to separate out their influence. 19. At least two aspects of this poll are troublesome. The first is that it was conducted by a group who would benefit by the result—almond sales are likely to increase if people believe that eating almonds will make them happier. The second is that this poll found that almond consumption and life satisfaction are correlated, but does not establish that eating almonds causes satisfaction. It is equally possible, for instance, that people with higher incomes are more likely to eat almonds, and are also more satisfied with their lives. 20. You want the sample of people who take part in a survey to be representative of the population from which they are drawn. People who refuse to take part in a survey often have different views than those who do participate, and so even a random sample may produce biased results if a large percentage of those selected refuse to participate in a survey. 1.3: Frequency, Frequency Tables, and Levels of Measurement 21. 13.2 1.4: Experimental Design and Ethics 22. a. population: all college students b. sample: the 100 college students in the study c. experimental units: each individual college student who participated d. explanatory variable: the size of the tableware e. treatment: tableware that is 20 percent smaller than normal f. response variable: the amount of food eaten 23. There are many lurking variables that could influence the observed differences in test scores. Perhaps the boys, on average, have taken more math courses than the girls, and the girls have taken more English classes than the boys. Perhaps the boys have been encouraged by their families and teachers to prepare for a career in math and science, and thus have put more effort into studying math, while the girls have been encouraged to prepare for fields like communication and psychology that are more focused on language use. A study design would have to control for these and other potential lurking variables (anything that could explain the observed difference in test scores, other than the genetic explanation) in order to draw a scientifically sound conclusion about genetic differences. 24. To use random assignment, you would have to be able to assign people to either smoke or not smoke. Because smoking has many harmful effects, this would not be an ethical experiment. Instead, we study people who have chosen to smoke, and compare them to others who have chosen not to smoke, and try to control for the other ways those two groups may differ (lurking variables). 25. Sources of bias include the fact that not everyone has a telephone, that cell phone numbers are often not listed in published directories, and that an individual might not be at home at the time of the phone call; all these factors make it likely that the respondents to the survey will not be representative of the population as a whole. 26. Research subjects should not be coerced into participation, and offering extra credit in exchange for participation could be construed as coercion. In addition, this method will result in a volunteer sample, which cannot be assumed to be representative of the population as a whole. 2.1: Stem-and Leaf Graphs (Stemplots), Line Graphs, and Bar Graphs 27. The value 740 is an outlier, because the exams were graded on a scale of 0 to 100, and 740 is far outside that range. It may be a data entry error, with the actual score being 74, so the professor should check that exam again to see what the actual score was. 28. 820 Appendix B This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 Stem Leaf 6 2 4 5 5 8 7 0 2 2 4 5 5 5 6 8 8 8 1 3 3 4 5 7 8 9 2 5 8 8 10 0 0 Table B4 29.

The bar from 3.5 to 4.5, with a central point of 4, will be tallest; its height will be nine, because there are nine students taking four courses. 34. The histogram is a better choice, because income is a continuous variable. 35. A bar graph is the better choice, because this data is categorical rather than continuous. 2.3: Measures of the Location of the Data 36. Your daughter scored better than 80 percent of the students in her grade on math and better than 76 percent of the students in reading. Both scores are very good, and place her in the upper quartile, but her math score is slightly better in relation to her peers than her reading score. 37.

Therefore, some students must fit into two or more categories (e.g., both going to college and working full time). 63. P(A and B) = (P(B|A))(P(A)) = (0.85)(0.70) = 0.595 64. No. If they were independent, P(B) would be the same as P(B|A). We know this is not the case, because P(B) = 0.70 and P(B|A) = 0.85. 3.4: Contingency Tables 65.

Joe conducts an experiment to see how many times he has to flip a coin before he gets four heads in a row. Does this qualify as a binomial experiment? Use the following information to answer the next three exercises. In a particularly community, 65 percent of households include at least one person who has graduated from college. You randomly sample 100 households in this community. Let X = the number of households including at least one college graduate. 21. Describe the probability distribution of X. 22. What is the mean of X? 23. What is the standard deviation of X? Use the following information to answer the next four exercises. Joe is the star of his school’s baseball team. His batting average is 0.400, meaning that for every ten times he comes to bat (an at-bat), four of those times he gets a hit. You decide to track his batting performance his next 20 at-bats. 24. Define the random variable X in this experiment. 25. Assuming Joe’s probability of getting a hit is independent and identical across all 20 at-bats, describe the distribution of X. 26. Given this information, what number of hits do you predict Joe will get? 27. What is the standard deviation of X? 4.4: Geometric Distribution 28. What are the three major characteristics of a geometric experiment? 29. You decide to conduct a geometric experiment by flipping a coin until it comes up heads. This takes five trials. Represent the outcomes of this trial, using H for heads and T for tails. 30.

If X = the number of drivers, and the average numbers of drivers per hour is four, how would you express this distribution? 39. What is the domain of X? 40. What are the mean and standard deviation of X? Appendix B 825 5.1: Continuous Probability Functions 41. You conduct a survey of students to see how many books they purchased the previous semester, the total amount they paid for those books, the number they sold after the semester was over, and the amount of money they received for the books they sold. Which variables in this survey are discrete, and which are continuous? 42. With continuous random variables, we never calculate the probability that X has a particular value, but always speak in terms of the probability that X has a value within a particular range. Why is this? 43. For a continuous random variable, why are P(x < c) and P(x ≤ c) equivalent statements? 44. For a continuous probability function, P(x < 5) = 0.35. What is P(x > 5), and how do you know? 45. Describe how you would draw the continuous probability distribution described by the function f (x) =1 10 for 0 ≤x≤ 10. What type of a distribution is this? 46. For the continuous probability distribution described by the function f (x) =1 10 for 0 ≤x≤ 10, what is the P(0 < x < 4)? 5.2: The Uniform Distribution 47.

What is the mean and standard deviation for waiting time? 51. What is the probability that a patient waits less than ten minutes? 5.3: The Exponential Distribution 52. The distribution of the variable X, representing the average time to failure for an automobile battery, can be written as: X ~ Exp(m). Describe this distribution in words. 53. If the value of m for an exponential distribution is ten, what are the mean and standard deviation for the distribution? 54. Write the probability density function for a variable distributed as: X ~ Exp(0.2). 6.1: The Standard Normal Distribution 55.

Find the z-score for a height of 105 centimeters and explain what that means In the context of the population. 60. What height corresponds to a z-score of 1.5 in this population? 61. Using the empirical rule, we expect about 68 percent of the values in a normal distribution to lie within one standard deviation above or below the mean. What does this mean, in terms of a specific range of values, for this distribution? 62. Using the empirical rule, about what percent of heights in this distribution do you expect to be between 95.5 cm and 122.5 cm? 6.2: Using the Normal Distribution Use the following information to answer the next four exercises. The distributor of lotto tickets claims that 20 percent of the tickets are winners. You draw a sample of 500 tickets to test this proposition. 826 Appendix B This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 63. Can you use the normal approximation to the binomial for your calculations? Why or why not. 64. What are the expected mean and standard deviation for your sample, assuming the distributor’s claim is true? 65. What is the probability that your sample will have a mean greater than 100? 66. If the z-score for your sample result is –2.00, explain what this means, using the empirical rule. 7.1: The Central Limit Theorem for Sample Means (Averages) 67. What does the central limit theorem state with regard to the distribution of sample means? 68. The distribution of results from flipping a fair coin is uniform: heads and tails are equally likely on any flip, and over a large number of trials, you expect about the same number of heads and tails. Yet if you conduct a study by flipping 30 coins and recording the number of heads, and repeat this 100 times, the distribution of the mean number of heads will be approximately normal. How is this possible? 69. The mean of a normally-distributed population is 50, and the standard deviation is four. If you draw 100 samples of size 40 from this population, describe what you would expect to see in terms of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. 70. X is a random variable with a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of two. Write the distribution for the sample mean of samples of size 100 drawn from this population. 71. Your friend is doing an experiment drawing samples of size 50 from a population with a mean of 117 and a standard deviation of 16. This sample size is large enough to allow use of the central limit theorem, so he says the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of sample means will also be 16. Explain why this is wrong, and calculate the correct value. 72. You are reading a research article that refers to “the standard error of the mean.” What does this mean, and how is it calculated? Use the following information to answer the next six exercises. You repeatedly draw samples of n = 100 from a population with a mean of 75 and a standard deviation of 4.5. 73. What is the expected distribution of the sample means? 74. One of your friends tries to convince you that the standard error of the mean should be 4.5. Explain what error your friend made. 75. What is the z-score for a sample mean of 76? 76. What is the z-score for a sample mean of 74.7? 77. What sample mean corresponds to a z-score of 1.5? 78. If you decrease the sample size to 50, will the standard error of the mean be smaller or larger? What would be its value? Use the following information to answer the next two questions. We use the empirical rule to analyze data for samples of size 60 drawn from a population with a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 9. 79. What range of values would you expect to include 68 percent of the sample means? 80. If you increased the sample size to 100, what range would you expect to contain 68 percent of the sample means, applying the empirical rule? 7.2: The Central Limit Theorem for Sums 81. How does the central limit theorem apply to sums of random variables? 82. Explain how the rules applying the central limit theorem to sample means, and to sums of a random variable, are similar. 83. If you repeatedly draw samples of size 50 from a population with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of four, and calculate the sum of each sample, what is the expected distribution of these sums? Use the following information to answer the next four exercises. You draw one sample of size 40 from a population with a mean of 125 and a standard deviation of seven. 84. Compute the sum. What is the probability that the sum for your sample will be less than 5,000? 85. If you drew samples of this size repeatedly, computing the sum each time, what range of values would you expect to contain 95 percent of the sample sums? 86. What value is one standard deviation below the mean? 87. What value corresponds to a z-score of 2.2? Appendix B 827 7.3: Using the Central Limit Theorem 88. What does the law of large numbers say about the relationship between the sample mean and the population mean? 89. Applying the law of large numbers, which sample mean would expect to be closer to the population mean, a sample of size ten or a sample of size 100? Use this information for the next three questions. A manufacturer makes screws with a mean diameter of 0.15 cm (centimeters) and a range of 0.10 cm to 0.20 cm; within that range, the distribution is uniform. 90. If X = the diameter of one screw, what is the distribution of X? 91. Suppose you repeatedly draw samples of size 100 and calculate their mean. Applying the central limit theorem, what is the distribution of these sample means? 92. Suppose you repeatedly draw samples of 60 and calculate their sum. Applying the central limit theorem, what is the distribution of these sample sums? Practice Test 2 Solutions Probability Distribution Function (PDF) for a Discrete Random Variable 1.

The domain of Y = {0, 1, 2, …}, i.e., the integers from 0 to the upper limit of classes allowed by the university. 3. The domain of Z = any amount of money from 0 upwards. 4. Because they can take any value within their domain, and their value for any particular case is not known until the survey is completed. 5. No, because the domain of Z includes only positive numbers (you can’t spend a negative amount of money).

X = Joe gets a hit in one at-bat (in one occasion of his coming to bat) 25. X ~ B(20, 0.4) 26. μ = np = 20(0.4) = 8 27. σ x= npq= 20(0.40)(0.60)= 2.19 4.4: Geometric Distribution 28. 1. A series of Bernoulli trials are conducted until one is a success, and then the experiment stops. 2. At least one trial is conducted, but there is no upper limit to the number of trials. 3. The probability of success or failure is the same for each trial. 29. T T T T H 30. The domain of X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ….n}. Because you are drawing with replacement, there is no upper bound to the number of draws that may be necessary. 31. The domain of X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8., 9, 10, 11, 12…27}. Because you are drawing without replacement, and 26 of the 52 cards are red, you have to draw a red card within the first 17 draws. 32. X ~ G(0.24) 33. µ = 1 p = 1 0.27 = 3.70 34. σ = 1 −p p2 = 1 − 0.27 0.27 2 = 3.16 4.5: Hypergeometric Distribution 35. Yes, because you are sampling from a population composed of two groups (boys and girls), have a group of interest (boys), and are sampling without replacement (hence, the probabilities change with each pick, and you are not performing Bernoulli trials). Appendix B 829 36. The group of interest is the cards that are spades, the size of the group of interest is 13, and the sample size is five. 4.6: Poisson Distribution 37. A Poisson distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, when the events are independent and the average rate of the events is known. 38. X ~ P(4) 39. The domain of X = {0, 1, 2, 3, …..) i.e., any integer from 0 upwards. 40. µ = 4 σ = 4= 2 5.1: Continuous Probability Functions 41. The discrete variables are the number of books purchased, and the number of books sold after the end of the semester. The continuous variables are the amount of money spent for the books, and the amount of money received when they were sold. 42. Because for a continuous random variable, P(x = c) = 0, where c is any single value. Instead, we calculate P(c < x < d), i.e., the probability that the value of x is between the values c and d. 43. Because P(x = c) = 0 for any continuous random variable. 44. P(x > 5) = 1 – 0.35 = 0.65, because the total probability of a continuous probability function is always 1. 45. This is a uniform probability distribution. You would draw it as a rectangle with the vertical sides at 0 and 20, and the horizontal sides at 1 10 and 0. 46. P(0 <x< 4)=(4 − 0) ⎛ ⎝ 1 10 ⎞ ⎠= 0.4 5.2: The Uniform Distribution 47. P(2 <x< 5)=(5 − 2) ⎛ ⎝ 1 10 ⎞ ⎠= 0.3 48. X ~ U(0, 15) 49. f (x) = 1 b −a for (a ≤x≤b) so f (x) =1 30 for (0 ≤x≤ 30) 50. µ = a + b 2 = 0 + 30 5 = 15.0 σ = (b −a) 2 12 = (30 − 0) 2 12 = 8.66 51. P(x< 10)=(10) ⎛ ⎝ 1 30 ⎞ ⎠= 0.33 5.3: The Exponential Distribution 52. X has an exponential distribution with decay parameter m and mean and standard deviation 1 m . In this distribution, there will be a relatively large numbers of small values, with values becoming less common as they become larger. 53. µ =σ = 1 m = 1 10 = 0.1 54. f(x) = 0.2e–0.2x where x ≥ 0. 6.1: The Standard Normal Distribution 55. The random variable X has a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. 56. X ~ N(0,1) 830 Appendix B This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 57. z =x−µ σ so z =112 − 109 4.5 = 0.67 58. z =x−µ σ so z =100 − 109 4.5 = − 2.00 59. z =105 − 109 4.5 = −0.89 This girl is shorter than average for her age, by 0.89 standard deviations. 60. 109 + (1.5)(4.5) = 115.75 cm 61. We expect about 68 percent of the heights of girls of age five years and zero months to be between 104.5 cm and 113.5 cm. 62. We expect 99.7 percent of the heights in this distribution to be between 95.5 cm and 122.5 cm, because that range represents the values three standard deviations above and below the mean. 6.2: Using the Normal Distribution 63. Yes, because both np and nq are greater than five. np = (500)(0.20) = 100 and nq = 500(0.80) = 400 64. µ =np= (500)(0.20) = 100 σ = npq= 500(0.20)(0.80)= 8.94 65. Fifty percent, because in a normal distribution, half the values lie above the mean. 66. The results of our sample were two standard deviations below the mean, suggesting it is unlikely that 20 percent of the lotto tickets are winners, as claimed by the distributor, and that the true percent of winners is lower. Applying the Empirical Rule, If that claim were true, we would expect to see a result this far below the mean only about 2.5 percent of the time. 7.1: The Central Limit Theorem for Sample Means (Averages) 67. The central limit theorem states that if samples of sufficient size drawn from a population, the distribution of sample means will be normal, even if the distribution of the population is not normal. 68. The sample size of 30 is sufficiently large in this example to apply the central limit theorem. This theorem ] states that for samples of sufficient size drawn from a population, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approach normality, regardless of the distribution of the population from which the samples were drawn. 69. You would not expect each sample to have a mean of 50, because of sampling variability. However, you would expect the sampling distribution of the sample means to cluster around 50, with an approximately normal distribution, so that values close to 50 are more common than values further removed from 50. 70. X ¯ ∼N(25, 0.2)because X ¯ ∼N⎛ ⎝µ x, σ x n ⎞ ⎠ 71. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample means can be calculated using the formula ⎛ ⎝ σ x n ⎞ ⎠, which in this case is ⎛ ⎝ 16 50 ⎞ ⎠. The correct value for the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample means is therefore 2.26. 72. The standard error of the mean is another name for the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. Given samples of size n drawn from a population with standard deviation σx, the standard error of the mean is ⎛ ⎝ σ x n ⎞ ⎠. 73. X ~ N(75, 0.45) 74. Your friend forgot to divide the standard deviation by the square root of n. 75. z = x¯ − µ x σ x = 76 − 75 4.5 = 2.2 76. z = x¯ − µ x σ x = 74.7 − 75 4.5 = −0.67 Appendix B 831 77. 75 + (1.5)(0.45) = 75.675 78. The standard error of the mean will be larger, because you will be dividing by a smaller number. The standard error of the mean for samples of size n = 50 is: ⎛ ⎝ σ x n ⎞ ⎠= 4.5 50 = 0.64 79. You would expect this range to include values up to one standard deviation above or below the mean of the sample means. In this case: 70 +9 60 = 71.16and 70 −9 60 = 68.84so you would expect 68 percent of the sample means to be between 68.84 and 71.16. 80. 70 +9 100 = 70.9and 70 −9 100 = 69.1so you would expect 68 percent of the sample means to be between 69.1 and 70.9. Note that this is a narrower interval due to the increased sample size. 7.2: The Central Limit Theorem for Sums 81. For a random variable X, the random variable ΣX will tend to become normally distributed as the size n of the samples used to compute the sum increases. 82. Both rules state that the distribution of a quantity (the mean or the sum) calculated on samples drawn from a population will tend to have a normal distribution, as the sample size increases, regardless of the distribution of population from which the samples are drawn. 83. ΣX ∼N ⎛ ⎝nµx, (n)(σ x) ⎞ ⎠ so ΣX ∼N(4000, 28.3) 84.The probability is 0.50, because 5,000 is the mean of the sampling distribution of sums of size 40 from this population. Sums of random variables computed from a sample of sufficient size are normally distributed, and in a normal distribution, half the values lie below the mean. 85. Using the empirical rule, you would expect 95 percent of the values to be within two standard deviations of the mean. Using the formula for the standard deviation is for a sample sum: (n)(σ x) = ⎛ ⎝ 40 ⎞ ⎠(7) = 44.3so you would expect 95 percent of the values to be between 5,000 + (2)(44.3) and 5,000 – (2)(44.3), or between 4,911.4 and 588.6. 86. µ −(n)(σ x)= 5000 − ⎛ ⎝ 40 ⎞ ⎠(7)= 4955.7 87. 5000 +(2.2) ⎛ ⎝ 40 ⎞ ⎠(7)= 5097.4 7.3: Using the Central Limit Theorem 88. The law of large numbers says that as sample size increases, the sample mean tends to get nearer and nearer to the population mean. 89. You would expect the mean from a sample of size 100 to be nearer to the population mean, because the law of large numbers says that as sample size increases, the sample mean tends to approach the population mea. 90. X ~ N(0.10, 0.20) 91. X ¯ ∼N⎛ ⎝µ x, σ x n ⎞ ⎠and the standard deviation of a uniform distribution is b −a 12 . In this example, the standard deviation of the distribution is b −a 12 =0.10 12 = 0.03 so X ¯ ∼N(0.15, 0.003) 92. ΣX ∼N((n)(µ x), (n)(σ x)) so ΣX ∼N(9.0, 0.23) Practice Test 3 8.1: Confidence Interval, Single Population Mean, Population Standard Deviation Known, Normal Use the following information to answer the next seven exercises.

A, B, and C. All three are linear equations of the form y = mx + b. 2. Let y = the total number of hours required, and x the square footage, measured in units of 1,000. The equation is: y = x + 4 3. Let y = the total payment, and x the number of students in a class. The equation is: y = 100(x) + 2,000 4. Let y = the total cost of attendance, and x the number of years enrolled. The equation is: y = 3,000(x) + 500 12.2: Slope and Y-intercept of a Linear Equation 5. The independent variable is the hours worked on a car. The dependent variable is the total labor charges to fix a car. 6. Let y = the total charge, and x the number of hours required. The equation is: y = 55x + 75 The slope is 55 and the intercept is 75. 7. y = 55(3.5) + 75 = 267.50 8. Because the intercept is included in both equations, while you are only interested in the difference in costs, you do not need to include the intercept in the solution. The difference in number of hours required is: 6.3 – 2.4 = 3.9. Multiply this difference by the cost per hour: 55(3.9) = 214.5. The difference in cost between the two jobs is $214.50. 12.3: Scatter Plots 9. The X and Y variables have a strong linear relationship. These variables would be good candidates for analysis with linear regression. 10. The X and Y variables have a strong negative linear relationship. These variables would be good candidates for analysis with linear regression. 11. There is no clear linear relationship between the X and Y variables, so they are not good candidates for linear regression. 12. The X and Y variables have a strong positive relationship, but it is curvilinear rather than linear. These variables are not good candidates for linear regression. 12.4: The Regression Equation 13. r ⎛ ⎝ sy sx ⎞ ⎠= 0.73 ⎛ ⎝ 9.6 4.0 ⎞ ⎠= 1.752 ≈ 1.75 14. a = y¯ −b x¯ = 141.6 − 1.752(68.4) = 21.7632 ≈ 21.76 15. y^ = 21.76 + 1.75(68) = 140.76 12.5: Correlation Coefficient and Coefficient of Determination 16. The coefficient of determination is the square of the correlation, or r2. For this data, r2 = (–0.56)2 = 0.3136 ≈ 0.31 or 31%. This means that 31 percent of the variation in fuel efficiency can be explained by the bodyweight of the automobile. 17. The coefficient of determination = 0.322 = 0.1024. This is the amount of variation in freshman college GPA that can be explained by high school GPA. The amount that cannot be explained is 1 – 0.1024 = 0.8976 ≈ 0.90. So about 90 percent of variance in freshman college GPA in this data is not explained by high school GPA. 18. r= r 2 0.5= 0.707106781 ≈ 0.71 You need a correlation of 0.71 or higher to have a coefficient of determination of at least 0.5. 12.6: Testing the Significance of the Correlation Coefficient 19. H0: ρ = 0 Ha: ρ ≠ 0 Appendix B 849 20. t =r n− 2 1 −r 2 =0.33 30 − 2 1 − 0.33 2 = 1.85 The critical value for α = 0.05 for a two-tailed test using the t29 distribution is 2.045. Your value is less than this, so you fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the study produced no evidence that the variables are significantly correlated. Using the calculator function tcdf, the p-value is 2tcdf(1.85, 10^99, 29) = 0.0373. Do not reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the study produced no evidence that the variables are significantly correlated. 21. t =r n− 2 1 −r 2 =0.45 25 − 2 1 − 0.45 2 = 2.417 The critical value for α = 0.05 for a two-tailed test using the t24 distribution is 2.064. Your value is greater than this, so you reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the study produced evidence that the variables are significantly correlated. Using the calculator function tcdf, the p-value is 2tcdf(2.417, 10^99, 24) = 0.0118. Reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the study produced evidence that the variables are significantly correlated. 12.7: Prediction 22. y^ = 25 + 16(5) = 105 23. Because the intercept appears in both predicted values, you can ignore it in calculating a predicted difference score. The difference in grams of fiber per serving is 6 – 3 = 3 and the predicted difference in grams of potassium per serving is (16)(3) = 48. 12.8: Outliers 24. An outlier is an observed value that is far from the least squares regression line. A rule of thumb is that a point more than two standard deviations of the residuals from its predicted value on the least squares regression line is an outlier. 25. An influential point is an observed value in a data set that is far from other points in the data set, in a horizontal direction. Unlike an outlier, an influential point is determined by its relationship with other values in the data set, not by its relationship to the regression line. 26. The predicted value for y is: y^ = 5 + 0.3x= 5.6. The value of 6.2 is less than two standard deviations from the predicted value, so it does not qualify as an outlier. Residual for (2, 6.2): 6.2 – 5.6 = 0.6 (0.6 < 2(0.4)) 27. The predicted value for y is: y^ = 2.3 – 0.1(4.1) = 1.89. The value of 2.32 is more than two standard deviations from the predicted value, so it qualifies as an outlier. Residual for (4.1, 2.34): 2.32 – 1.89 = 0.43 (0.43 > 2(0.13)) 13.1: One-Way ANOVA 28. 1. Each sample is drawn from a normally distributed population 2. All samples are independent and randomly selected. 3. The populations from which the samples are draw have equal standard deviations. 4. The factor is a categorical variable. 5. The response is a numerical variable. 29. H0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3 = μ4 Ha: At least two of the group means μ1, μ2, μ3, μ4 are not equal. 30. The independent samples t-test can only compare means from two groups, while one-way ANOVA can compare means of more than two groups. 31. Each sample appears to have been drawn from a normally distributed populations, the factor is a categorical variable (method), the outcome is a numerical variable (test score), and you were told the samples were independent and randomly selected, so those requirements are met. However, each sample has a different standard deviation, and this suggests that the populations from which they were drawn also have different standard deviations, which is a violation of an assumption for one-way ANOVA. Further statistical testing will be necessary to test the assumption of equal variance before proceeding with the analysis. 850 Appendix B This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11562/1.18 32. One of the assumptions for a one-way ANOVA is that the samples are drawn from normally distributed populations. Since two of your samples have an approximately uniform distribution, this casts doubt on whether this assumption has been met. Further statistical testing will be necessary to determine if you can proceed with the analysis. 13.2: The F Distribution 33. SSwithin is the sum of squares within groups, representing the variation in outcome that cannot be attributed to the different feed supplements, but due to individual or chance factors among the calves in each group. 34. SSbetween is the sum of squares between groups, representing the variation in outcome that can be attributed to the different feed supplements. 35. k = the number of groups = 4 n1 = the number of cases in group 1 = 30 n = the total number of cases = 4(30) = 120 36. SStotal = SSwithin + SSbetween so SSbetween = SStotal – SSwithin 621.4 – 374.5 = 246.9 37. The mean squares in an ANOVA are found by dividing each sum of squares by its respective degrees of freedom (df). For SStotal, df = n – 1 = 120 – 1 = 119. For SSbetween, df = k – 1 = 4 – 1 = 3. For SSwithin, df = 120 – 4 = 116. MSbetween = 246.9 3 = 82.3 MSwithin = 374.5 116 = 3.23 38. F=MSbetween MSwithin =82.3 3.23 = 25.48 39. It would be larger, because you would be dividing by a smaller number. The value of MSbetween would not change with a change of sample size, but the value of MSwithin would be smaller, because you would be dividing by a larger number (dfwithin would be 136, not 116). Dividing a constant by a smaller number produces a larger result. 13.3: Facts About the F Distribution 40. All but choice c, –3.61. F Statistics are always greater than or equal to 0. 41. As the degrees of freedom increase in an F distribution, the distribution becomes more nearly normal. Histogram F2 is closer to a normal distribution than histogram F1, so the sample displayed in histogram F1 was drawn from the F3,15 population, and the sample displayed in histogram F2 was drawn from the F5,500 population. 42. Using the calculator function Fcdf, p-value = Fcdf(3.67, 1E, 3,50) = 0.0182. Reject the null hypothesis. 43. Using the calculator function Fcdf, p-value = Fcdf(4.72, 1E, 4, 100) = 0.0016 Reject the null hypothesis. 13.4: Test of Two Variances 44. The samples must be drawn from populations that are normally distributed, and must be drawn from independent populations. 45.
