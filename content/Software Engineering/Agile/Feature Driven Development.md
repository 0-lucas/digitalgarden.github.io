# What is it?

In [[Software Engineering]], the *FDD method*, which stands for **feature driven development**, is an [[Agile]] method that emphasizes the use of [[OOP]], and it's a **feature-focused method**, as opposed to *delivery-focused* method like [[Scrum]].

Also differently from [[Scrum]], where the *product owner* is typically seen as the user, in *FDD*, the end user is the **actual user**. *FDD* also **relies on documentation** to **communicate important information** of the project, instead of continuous communication within the team, like in [[Scrum]].

# How does it work?

Typically, a project life cycle is divided in *initial modelling* and *model storming*, with each having more actions inside. For **each project**, the *initial modelling* is done only once, while the **last steps are done for every feature**.

## Initial modelling

- ### Develop an overall model
	An overall model shape is formed for the project, **with the goals and target audience in mind,** and their **needs**. This can be divided into *domain models*, which are **sub parts of the overall system**.

- ### Build a features list
	A **list of features is created**, with the requirements gathered from the first step, and all client-valued inputs. Each feature needs to be completed in two weeks' time, keeping in mind that it should be purposes and functionalities, instead of tasks.
