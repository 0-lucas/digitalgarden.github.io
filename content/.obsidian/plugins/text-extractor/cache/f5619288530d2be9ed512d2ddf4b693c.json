That’s data analysis. The six chapters in Part I present the ideas and tools of statistical data analysis. They equip you with skills that are immediately useful whenever you deal with numbers. These chapters reﬂect the strong emphasis on exploring data that character- izes modern statistics. Although careful exploration of data is essential if we are to trust the results of inference, data analysis isn’t just preparation for inference. To think about inference, we carefully distinguish between the data we actually have and the larger universe we want conclusions about. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, for example, has data about employment in the 55,000 households contacted by its Current Population Survey. The bureau wants to draw conclu- sions about employment in all 110 million U.S. households. That’s a complex problem. From the viewpoint of data analysis, things are simpler. We want to explore and understand only the data in hand. The distinctions that inference requires don’t concern us in Chapters 1 to 6. What does concern us is a sys- tematic strategy for examining data and the tools that we use to carry out that strategy. Part of that strategy is to ﬁrst look at one thing at a time and then at relation- ships. In Chapters 1, 2, and 3 you will study variables and their distributions. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 concern relationships among variables. 0 P1: FBQ PB286A-01 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:19 PART I EXPLORING DATA:VARIABLES AND DISTRIBUTIONS Chapter 1 Picturing Distributions with Graphs Chapter 2 Describing Distributions with Numbers Chapter 3 The Normal Distributions EXPLORING DATA:RELATIONSHIPS Chapter 4 Scatterplots and Correlation Chapter 5 Regression Chapter 6 Two-Way Tables EXPLORING DATA REVIEW 1 P1: FBQ PB286A-01 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:19 2 P1: FBQ PB286A-01 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:19 CHAPTER 1(DarrellIngham/AllsportConcepts/GettyImages) Picturing Distributions with Graphs In this chapter we cover. . . Individuals and variables Categorical variables: pie charts and bar graphs Quantitative variables: histograms Interpreting histograms Quantitative variables: stemplots Time plots Statistics is the science of data. The volume of data available to us is over- whelming. Each March, for example, the Census Bureau collects economic and employment data from more than 200,000 people. From the bureau’s Web site you can choose to examine more than 300 items of data for each person (and more for households): child care assistance, child care support, hours worked, usual weekly earnings, and much more. The ﬁrst step in dealing with such a ﬂood of data is to organize our thinking about data. Individuals and variables Any set of data contains information about some group of individuals.The in- formation is organized in variables. INDIVIDUALS AND VARIABLES Individuals are the objects described by a set of data. Individuals may be people, but they may also be animals or things. A variable is any characteristic of an individual. A variable can take different values for different individuals. 3 P1: FBQ PB286A-01 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:19 4 CHAPTER 1 \u0001 Picturing Distributions with Graphs A college’s student data base, for example, includes data about every cur- rently enrolled student. The students are the individuals described by the data set. For each individual, the data contain the values of variables such as date of birth, gender (female or male), choice of major, and grade point average. In practice, any set of data is accompanied by background information that helps us understand the data. When you plan a statistical study or explore data from someone else’s work, ask yourself the following questions: Are data artistic? David Galenson, an economist at the University of Chicago, uses data and statistical analysis to study innovation among painters from the nineteenth century to the present. Economics journals publish his work. Art history journals send it back unread.“Fundamentally antagonistic to the way humanists do their work,” said the chair of art history at Chicago. If you are a student of the humanities, reading this statistics text may help you start a new wave in your ﬁeld. 1. Who? What individuals do the data describe? How many individuals appear in the data? 2. What? How many variables do the data contain? What are the exact definitions of these variables? In what units of measurement is each variable recorded? Weights, for example, might be recorded in pounds, in thousands of pounds, or in kilograms. 3. Why? What purpose do the data have? Do we hope to answer some speciﬁc questions? Do we want to draw conclusions about individuals other than the ones we actually have data for? Are the variables suitable for the intended purpose? Some variables, like gender and college major, simply place individuals into categories. Others, like height and grade point average, take numerical values for which we can do arithmetic. It makes sense to give an average income for a company’s employees, but it does not make sense to give an “average” gender. We can, however, count the numbers of female and male employees and do arithmetic with these counts. CATEGORICAL AND QUANTITATIVE VARIABLES A categorical variable places an individual into one of several groups or categories. A quantitative variable takes numerical values for which arithmetic operations such as adding and averaging make sense. The distribution of a variable tells us what values it takes and how often it takes these values. EXAMPLE 1.1 A professor’s data set Here is part of the data set in which a professor records information about student performance in a course: P1: FBQ PB286A-01 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:19 5Individuals and variables The individuals described are the students. Each row records data on one individual. Each column contains the values of one variable for all the individuals. In addition to the student’s name, there are 7 variables. School and major are categorical vari- ables. Scores on homework, the midterm, and the ﬁnal exam and the total score are quantitative. Grade is recorded as a category (A, B, and so on), but each grade also corresponds to a quantitative score (A = 4, B = 3, and so on) that is used to calculate student grade point averages. Most data tables follow this format—each row is an individual, and each col- umn is a variable. This data set appears in a spreadsheet program that has rows and spreadsheet columns ready for your use. Spreadsheets are commonly used to enter and transmit data and to do simple calculations such as adding homework, midterm, and ﬁnal scores to get total points. APPLYYOURKNOWLEDGE 1.1 Fuel economy.

This examination is called exploratory data analysis. Like an explorerexploratory data analysis crossing unknown lands, we want ﬁrst to simply describe what we see. Here are two basic strategies that help us organize our exploration of a set of data: \u0001 Begin by examining each variable by itself. Then move on to study the relationships among the variables. \u0001 Begin with a graph or graphs. Then add numerical summaries of speciﬁc aspects of the data. We will follow these principles in organizing our learning. Chapters 1 to 3 present methods for describing a single variable. We study relationships among several variables in Chapters 4 to 6. In each case, we begin with graphical dis- plays, then add numerical summaries for more complete description. The proper choice of graph depends on the nature of the variable. The val- ues of a categorical variable are labels for the categories, such as “male” and “female.” The distribution of a categorical variable lists the categories and gives either the count or the percent of individuals who fall in each category. EXAMPLE 1.2 Garbage The formal name for garbage is “municipal solid waste.” Here is a breakdown of the materials that made up American municipal solid waste in 2000. 1 Weight Material (million tons) Percent of total Food scraps 25.9 11.2% Glass 12.8 5.5% Metals 18.0 7.8% Paper, paperboard 86.7 37.4% Plastics 24.7 10.7% Rubber, leather, textiles 15.8 6.8% Wood 12.7 5.5% Yard trimmings 27.7 11.9% Other 7.5 3.2% Total 231.9 100.0 It’s a good idea to check data for consistency. The weights of the nine materials add to 231.8 million tons, not exactly equal to the total of 231.9 million tons given in the table. What happened? Roundoff error: Each entry is rounded to the nearestroundoff error tenth, and the total is rounded separately. The exact values would add exactly, but the rounded values don’t quite. The pie chart in Figure 1.1 shows us each material as a part of the whole.pie chart For example, the “plastics” slice makes up 10.7% of the pie because 10.7% of municipal solid waste consists of plastics. The graph shows more clearly than the numbers the predominance of paper and the importance of food scraps, P1: FBQ PB286A-01 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:19 7Categorical variables: pie charts and bar graphs Food scraps Glass Metals Paper Plastics Rubber, leather, textiles Wood Yard trimmings Other Figure 1.1 Pie chart of materials in municipal solid waste, by weight. plastics, and yard trimmings in our garbage. Pie charts are awkward to make by hand, but software will do the job for you. We could also make a bar graph that represents each material’s weight by bar graph the height of a bar. To make a pie chart, you must include all the categories that make up a whole. Bar graphs are more ﬂexible. Figure 1.2(a) is a bar graph of the percent of each material that was recycled or composted in 2000. These percents are not part of a whole because each refers to a different material. We could replace the pie chart in Figure 1.1 by a bar graph, but we can’t make a pie chart to replace Figure 1.2(a). We can often improve a bar graph by changing the order of the groups we are comparing. Figure 1.2(b) displays the recycling data with the materials in order of percent recycled or composted. Figures 1.1 and 1.2 together suggest that we might pay more attention to recycling plastics. Bar graphs and pie charts help an audience grasp the distribution quickly. They are, however, of limited use for data analysis because it is easy to under- stand data on a single categorical variable without a graph. We will move on to quantitative variables, where graphs are essential tools. APPLYYOURKNOWLEDGE 1.3 The color of your car.

Would it also be correct to make a pie chart? Suggest some possible reasons why there are fewer births on weekends. Quantitative variables: histograms Quantitative variables often take many values. A graph of the distribution is clearer if nearby values are grouped together. The most common graph of the distribution of one quantitative variable is a histogram. histogram EXAMPLE 1.3 Making a histogram One of the most striking ﬁndings of the 2000 census was the growth of the His- panic population of the United States. Table 1.1 presents the percent of resi- dents in each of the 50 states who identiﬁed themselves in the 2000 census as “Spanish/Hispanic/Latino.”4 The individuals in this data set are the 50 states. The variable is the percent of Hispanics in a state’s population. To make a histogram of the distribution of this variable, proceed as follows: Step 1. Choose the classes. Divide the range of the data into classes of equal width. The data in Table 1.1 range from 0.7 to 42.1, so we decide to choose these classes: 0.0 ≤ percent Hispanic < 5.0 5.0 ≤ percent Hispanic < 10.0 · · · 40.0 ≤ percent Hispanic < 45.0 Be sure to specify the classes precisely so that each individual falls into exactly one class. A state with 4.9% Hispanic residents would fall into the ﬁrst class, but a state with 5.0% falls into the second. P1: FBQ PB286A-01 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:19 10 CHAPTER 1 \u0001 Picturing Distributions with Graphs TABLE 1.1 Percent of population of Hispanic origin, by state (2000) State Percent State Percent State Percent Alabama 1.5 Louisiana 2.4 Ohio 1.9 Alaska 4.1 Maine 0.7 Oklahoma 5.2 Arizona 25.3 Maryland 4.3 Oregon 8.0 Arkansas 2.8 Massachusetts 6.8 Pennsylvania 3.2 California 32.4 Michigan 3.3 Rhode Island 8.7 Colorado 17.1 Minnesota 2.9 South Carolina 2.4 Connecticut 9.4 Mississippi 1.3 South Dakota 1.4 Delaware 4.8 Missouri 2.1 Tennessee 2.0 Florida 16.8 Montana 2.0 Texas 32.0 Georgia 5.3 Nebraska 5.5 Utah 9.0 Hawaii 7.2 Nevada 19.7 Vermont 0.9 Idaho 7.9 New Hampshire 1.7 Virginia 4.7 Illinois 10.7 New Jersey 13.3 Washington 7.2 Indiana 3.5 New Mexico 42.1 West Virginia 0.7 Iowa 2.8 New York 15.1 Wisconsin 3.6 Kansas 7.0 North Carolina 4.7 Wyoming 6.4 Kentucky 1.5 North Dakota 1.2 Step 2. Count the individuals in each class. Here are the counts: Class Count Class Count Class Count 0.0 to 4.9 27 15.0 to 19.9 4 30.0 to 34.9 2 5.0 to 9.9 13 20.0 to 24.9 0 35.0 to 39.9 0 10.0 to 14.9 2 25.0 to 29.9 1 40.0 to 44.9 1 Step 3. Draw the histogram. Mark the scale for the variable whose distribution you are displaying on the horizontal axis. That’s the percent of a state’s population who are Hispanic. The scale runs from 0 to 45 because that is the span of the classes we chose. The vertical axis contains the scale of counts. Each bar represents a class. The base of the bar covers the class, and the bar height is the class count. There is no horizontal space between the bars unless a class is empty, so that its bar has height zero. Figure 1.3 is our histogram. The bars of a histogram should cover the entire range of values of a vari- able. When the possible values of a variable have gaps between them, extend the bases of the bars to meet halfway between two adjacent possible values. For example, in a histogram of the ages in years of university faculty, the bars representing 25 to 29 years and 30 to 34 years would meet at 29.5. Our eyes respond to the area of the bars in a histogram.5 Because the classes are all the same width, area is determined by height and all classes are fairly represented. There is no one right choice of the classes in a histogram.

The height of this bar is 13 because 13 states had between 5.0% and 9.9% Hispanic residents. Figure 1.3 Histogram of the distribution of the percent of Hispanics among the residents of the 50 states. This distribution is skewed to the right. few classes will give a “skyscraper” graph, with all values in a few classes with tall bars. Too many will produce a “pancake” graph, with most classes having one or no observations. Neither choice will give a good picture of the shape of the distribution. You must use your judgment in choosing classes to display the shape. Statistics software will choose the classes for you. The software’s choice is usually a good one, but you can change it if you want. APPLYYOURKNOWLEDGE 1.5 Sports car fuel economy. Interested in a sports car? The Environmental Protection Agency lists most such vehicles in its “two-seater” category. Table 1.2 gives the city and highway mileages (miles per gallon) for the 22 two-seaters listed for the 2002 model year. 6 Make a histogram of the highway mileages of these cars using classes with width 5 miles per gallon. Interpreting histograms Making a statistical graph is not an end in itself. The purpose of the graph is to help us understand the data. After you make a graph, always ask, “What do I see?”Once you have displayed a distribution, you can see its important features as follows. P1: FBQ PB286A-01 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:19 12 CHAPTER 1 \u0001 Picturing Distributions with Graphs TABLE 1.2 Gas mileage (miles per gallon) for 2002 model two-seater cars Model City Highway Model City Highway Acura NSX 17 24 Honda Insight 57 56 Audi TT Quattro 20 28 Honda S2000 20 26 Audi TT Roadster 22 31 Lamborghini Murcielago 9 13 BMW M Coupe 17 25 Mazda Miata 22 28 BMW Z3 Coupe 19 27 Mercedes-Benz SL500 16 23 BMW Z3 Roadster 20 27 Mercedes-Benz SL600 13 19 BMW Z8 13 21 Mercedes-Benz SLK230 23 30 Chevrolet Corvette 18 25 Mercedes-Benz SLK320 20 26 Chrysler Prowler 18 23 Porsche 911 GT2 15 22 Ferrari 360 Modena 11 16 Porsche Boxster 19 27 Ford Thunderbird 17 23 Toyota MR2 25 30 EXAMINING A DISTRIBUTION In any graph of data, look for the overall pattern and for striking deviations from that pattern. You can describe the overall pattern of a histogram by its shape, center, and spread. An important kind of deviation is an outlier, an individual value that falls outside the overall pattern. We will learn how to describe center and spread numerically in Chapter 2. For now, we can describe the center of a distribution by its midpoint, the value with roughly half the observations taking smaller values and half taking larger values. We can describe the spread of a distribution by giving the smallest and largest values. EXAMPLE 1.4 Describing a distribution Look again at the histogram in Figure 1.3. Shape: The distribution has a single peak, which represents states that are less than 5% Hispanic. The distribution is skewed to the right. Most states have no more than 10% Hispanics, but some states have much higher percentages, so that the graph trails off to the right. Center: Table 1.1 shows that about half the states have less than 4.7% Hispanics among their residents and half have more. So the midpoint of the distribution is close to 4.7%. Spread: The spread is from about 0% to 42%, but only four states fall above 20%. Outliers: Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas stand out. Whether these are outliers or just part of the long right tail of the distribution is a matter of judg- ment. There is no rule for calling an observation an outlier. Once you have spotted possible outliers, look for an explanation. Some outliers are due to mistakes, such as typing 4.2 as 42. Other outliers point to the special nature of some observations. These four states are heavily Hispanic by history and location. P1: FBQ PB286A-01 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:19 13Interpreting histograms When you describe a distribution, concentrate on the main features. Look for major peaks, not for minor ups and downs in the bars of the histogram. Look for clear outliers, not just for the smallest and largest observations. Look for rough symmetry or clear skewness. SYMMETRIC AND SKEWED DISTRIBUTIONS A distribution is symmetric if the right and left sides of the histogram are approximately mirror images of each other. A distribution is skewed to the right if the right side of the histogram (containing the half of the observations with larger values) extends much farther out than the left side. It is skewed to the left if the left side of the histogram extends much farther out than the right side. Here are more examples of describing the overall pattern of a histogram. EXAMPLE 1.5 Iowa Test scores Figure 1.4 displays the scores of all 947 seventh-grade students in the public schools of Gary, Indiana, on the vocabulary part of the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. The 2 10 12024681012 Grade-equivalent vocabulary scorePercent of seventh-grade students 864 Figure 1.4 Histogram of the Iowa Test vocabulary scores of all seventh-grade students in Gary, Indiana. This distribution is single-peaked and symmetric. P1: FBQ PB286A-01 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:19 14 CHAPTER 1 \u0001 Picturing Distributions with Graphs distribution is single-peaked and symmetric. In mathematics, the two sides of symmet- ric patterns are exact mirror images. Real data are almost never exactly symmetric. We are content to describe Figure 1.4 as symmetric. The center (half above, half below) is close to 7. This is seventh-grade reading level. The scores range from 2.0 (second-grade level) to 12.1 (twelfth-grade level). Notice that the vertical scale in Figure 1.4 is not the count of students but the per- cent of Gary students in each histogram class. A histogram of percents rather than counts is convenient when we want to compare several distributions. To compare Gary with Los Angeles, a much bigger city, we would use percents so that both his- tograms have the same vertical scale. EXAMPLE 1.6 College costs Jeanna plans to attend college in her home state of Massachusetts. In the College Board’s Annual Survey of Colleges, she ﬁnds data on estimated college costs for the 2002–2003 academic year. Figure 1.5 displays the costs for all 56 four-year colleges in Massachusetts (omitting art schools and other special colleges). As is often the case, we can’t call this irregular distribution either symmetric or skewed. The big feature of the overall pattern is two separate clusters of colleges, 11 costing less than $16,000clusters and the remaining 45 costing more than $20,000. Clusters suggest that two types of individuals are mixed in the data set. In fact, the histogram distinguishes the 11 state colleges in Massachusetts from the 45 private colleges, which charge much more. 812 16 20 24 28 32 36 Annual cost of college ($1000)0246810Number of Massachusetts colleges Figure 1.5 Histogram of the estimated costs (in thousands of dollars) for four-year colleges in Massachusetts.

P1: FBQ PB286A-01 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:19 15Quantitative variables: stemplots The overall shape of a distribution is important information about a vari- able. Some types of data regularly produce distributions that are symmetric or skewed. For example, the sizes of living things of the same species (like lengths of crickets) tend to be symmetric. Data on incomes (whether of individuals, companies, or nations) are usually strongly skewed to the right. There are many moderate incomes, some large incomes, and a few very large incomes. Many dis- tributions have irregular shapes that are neither symmetric nor skewed. Some data show other patterns, such as the clusters in Figure 1.5. Use your eyes and describe what you see. APPLYYOURKNOWLEDGE 1.6 Sports car fuel economy. Table 1.2 (page 12) gives data on the fuel economy of 2002 model sports cars. Your histogram (Exercise 1.5) shows an extreme high outlier. This is the Honda Insight, a hybrid gas-electric car that is quite different from the others listed. Make a new histogram of highway mileage, leaving out the Insight. Classes that are about 2 miles per gallon wide work well. (a) Describe the main features (shape, center, spread, outliers) of the distribution of highway mileage. (b) The government imposes a “gas guzzler” tax on cars with low gas mileage. Which of these cars do you think may be subject to the gas guzzler tax? 1.7 College costs. Describe the center (midpoint) and spread (smallest to largest) of the distribution of Massachusetts college costs in Figure 1.5. An overall description works poorly because of the clusters. A better description gives the center and spread of each cluster (public and private colleges) separately. Do this. Quantitative variables: stemplots Histograms are not the only graphical display of distributions. For small data sets, a stemplot is quicker to make and presents more detailed information. STEMPLOT To make a stemplot: 1. Separate each observation into a stem, consisting of all but the ﬁnal (rightmost) digit, and a leaf, the ﬁnal digit. Stems may have as many digits as needed, but each leaf contains only a single digit. 2. Write the stems in a vertical column with the smallest at the top, and draw a vertical line at the right of this column. 3. Write each leaf in the row to the right of its stem, in increasing order out from the stem. P1: FBQ PB286A-01 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:19 16 CHAPTER 1 \u0001 Picturing Distributions with Graphs 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 21 22 23 24 25 779 2345579 00144889 2356 13778 235 48 0229 07 04 7 3 1 8 1 7 3 These entries are 6.4% and 6.8% Figure 1.6 Stemplot of the percents of Hispanic residents in the states. Each stem is a percent and leaves are tenths of a percent. EXAMPLE 1.7 Making a stemplot For the percents of Hispanic residents in Table 1.1, take the whole-number part of the percent as the stem and the ﬁnal digit (tenths) as the leaf. The Massachusetts entry, 6.8%, has stem 6 and leaf 8. Wyoming, at 6.4%, places leaf 4 on the same stem. These are the only observations on this stem. We then arrange the leaves in order, as 48, so that 6 | 48 is one row in the stemplot. Figure 1.6 is the complete stemplot for the data in Table 1.1. To save space, we left out California, Texas, and New Mexico, which have stems 32 and 42. The vital few? Skewed distributions can show us where to concentrate our efforts. Ten percent of the cars on the road account for half of all carbon dioxide emissions. A histogram of CO2 emissions would show many cars with small or moderate values and a few with very high values. Cleaning up or replacing these cars would reduce pollution at acostmuchlowerthanthatof programs aimed at all cars. Statisticians who work at improving quality in industry make a principle of this: distinguish “the vital few” from “the trivial many.” A stemplot looks like a histogram turned on end. Compare the stemplot in Figure 1.6 with the histogram of the same data in Figure 1.3. Both show a single-peaked distribution that is strongly right-skewed and has some observa- tions that we would probably call high outliers (three of these are left out of Figure 1.6). You can choose the classes in a histogram. The classes (the stems) of a stemplot are given to you. Figure 1.6 has more stems than there are classes in Figure 1.3. So histograms are more ﬂexible. But the stemplot, unlike the his- togram, preserves the actual value of each observation. Stemplots work well for small sets of data. Use a histogram to display larger data sets, like the 947 Iowa Test scores in Figure 1.4. EXAMPLE 1.8 Pulling wood apart Student engineers learn that although handbooks give the strength of a material as a single number, in fact the strength varies from piece to piece.

To avoid many stems with only one leaf each, ﬁrst round the data to the nearest hundred rounding pounds. The rounded data are 332 319 326 265 333 323 330 320 305 327 230 309 327 336 323 240 302 313 287 319 Now it is easy to make a stemplot with the ﬁrst two digits (thousands of pounds) as stems and the third digit (hundreds of pounds) as leaves. Figure 1.7 is the stemplot. The distribution is skewed to the left, with midpoint around 320 (32,000 pounds) and spread from 230 to 336. You can also split stems to double the number of stems when all the leaves splitting stems would otherwise fall on just a few stems. Each stem then appears twice. Leaves 0 to 4 go on the upper stem, and leaves 5 to 9 go on the lower stem. If you split the stems in the stemplot of Figure 1.7, for example, the 32 and 33 stems become 32 033 32 677 33 023 33 6 Rounding and splitting stems are matters for judgment, like choosing the classes in a histogram. The wood strength data require rounding but don’t require split- ting stems. APPLYYOURKNOWLEDGE 1.8 Students’ attitudes.

The overall shape of the distribution is irregular, as often happens when only a few observations are available. Are there any outliers? About where is the center of the distribution (the score with half the scores above it and half below)? What is the spread of the scores (ignoring any outliers)? 1.9 Alternative stemplots. Return to the Hispanics data in Table 1.1 and Figure 1.6. Round each state’s percent Hispanic to the nearest whole percent. Make a stemplot using tens of percents as stems and percents as leaves. All of the leaves fall on just ﬁve stems, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Make another stemplot using split stems to increase the number of classes. With Figure 1.6, you now have three stemplots of the Hispanics data. Which do you prefer? Why? Time plots Many variables are measured at intervals over time. We might, for example, measure the height of a growing child or the price of a stock at the end of each month. In these examples, our main interest is change over time. To display change over time, make a time plot. TIME PLOT A time plot of a variable plots each observation against the time at which it was measured. Always put time on the horizontal scale of your plot and the variable you are measuring on the vertical scale. Connecting the data points by lines helps emphasize any change over time. EXAMPLE 1.9 More on the cost of college How have college tuition and fees changed over time? Table 1.3 gives the average tuition and fees paid by college students at four-year colleges, both public and pri- vate, from the 1971–1972 academic year to the 2001–2002 academic year. To com- pare dollar amounts across time, we must adjust for the changing buying power of the dollar. Table 1.3 gives tuition in real dollars, dollars that have constant buying power.7 Average tuition in real dollars goes up only when the actual tuition rises by more than the overall cost of living. Figure 1.8 is a time plot of both public and private tuition.

One common overall pattern is a trend,trend a long-term upward or downward movement over time. Figure 1.8 shows an upward trend in real college tuition costs, with no striking deviations such as short-term drops. It also shows that, beginning around 1980, private colleges raised tuition faster than public institutions, increasing the gap in costs between the two types of colleges. Figures 1.5 and 1.8 both give information about college costs. The data for the time plot in Figure 1.8 are time series data that show the change in averagetime series tuition over time. The data for the histogram in Figure 1.5 are cross-sectionalcross-sectional data that show the variation in costs (in one state) at a ﬁxed time.

Individuals may be people, animals, or things. For each individual, the data give values for one or more variables. A variable describes some characteristic of an individual, such as a person’s height, gender, or salary. Some variables are categorical and others are quantitative. A categorical variable places each individual into a category, like male or female. A quantitative variable has numerical values that measure some characteristic of each individual, like height in centimeters or salary in dollars per year. Exploratory data analysis uses graphs and numerical summaries to describe the variables in a data set and the relations among them. P1: FBQ PB286A-01 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:19 21Chapter 1 Exercises The distribution of a variable describes what values the variable takes and how often it takes these values. To describe a distribution, begin with a graph. Bar graphs and pie charts describe the distribution of a categorical variable. Histograms and stemplots graph the distribution of a quantitative variable. When examining any graph, look for an overall pattern and for notable deviations from the pattern. Shape, center, and spread describe the overall pattern of a distribution. Some distributions have simple shapes, such as symmetric or skewed. Not all distributions have a simple overall shape, especially when there are few observations. Outliers are observations that lie outside the overall pattern of a distribution. Always look for outliers and try to explain them. When observations on a variable are taken over time, make a time plot that graphs time horizontally and the values of the variable vertically. A time plot can reveal trends or other changes over time. Chapter 1 EXERCISES 1.11 Car colors in Japan.

(b) Give a brief description of the pattern of Boston Marathon winning times over these years. Has the rate of improvement in times slowed in recent years? 1.28 Watch those scales! The impression that a time plot gives depends on the scales you use on the two axes. If you stretch the vertical axis and compress the time axis, change appears to be more rapid. Compressing the vertical axis and stretching the time axis make change appear slower. Make two more time plots of the data on public college tuition in Table 1.3, one that makes tuition appear to increase very rapidly and one that shows only a gentle increase.

Measuring center: the mean Measuring center: the median Comparing the mean and the median Measuring spread: the quartiles The five-number summary and boxplots Measuring spread: the standard deviation Choosing measures of center and spread Using technology How much do people with a bachelor’s degree (but no higher degree) earn? Here are the incomes of 15 such people, chosen at random by the Census Bu- reau in March 2002 and asked how much they earned in 2001.1 Most people reported their incomes to the nearest thousand dollars, so we have rounded their responses to thousands of dollars. 110 25 50 50 55 30 35 30 4 32 50 30 32 74 60 Figure 2.1 is a stemplot of these amounts. The distribution is irregular in shape, as is common when we have only a few observations. There is one high out- lier, a person who made $110,000. Our goal in this chapter is to describe with numbers the center and spread of this and other distributions. Measuring center: the mean The most common measure of center is the ordinary arithmetic average, or mean. 32 P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286A-02 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:23 33Measuring center: the mean 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 4 5 000125 0005 0 4 0 Figure 2.1 Stemplot of the earnings (in thousands of dollars) of 15 people chosen at random from all people with a bachelor’s degree but no higher degree. THE MEAN x To ﬁnd the mean of a set of observations, add their values and divide by the number of observations. If the n observations are x1, x2,..., xn, their mean is x = x1 + x2 + ··· + xn n or in more compact notation, x = 1 n ∑ xi The \u0004 (capital Greek sigma) in the formula for the mean is short for “add them all up.” The subscripts on the observations xi are just a way of keeping the n observations distinct. They do not necessarily indicate order or any other special facts about the data. The bar over the x indicates the mean of all the x-values. Pronounce the mean x as “x-bar.” This notation is very common. When writers who are discussing data use x or y, they are talking about a mean. EXAMPLE 2.1 Earnings of college graduates The mean earnings for our 15 college graduates are x = x1 + x2 +· · · + xn n = 110 + 25 +· · · + 60 15 = 666 15 = 44.4, or $44,400 In practice, you can key the data into your calculator and hit the mean key. You don’t have to actually add and divide. But you should know that this is what the calculator is doing. If we leave out the one high income, $110,000, the mean for the remaining 14 people is $39,700. The lone outlier raises the mean income of the group by $4700.

These may be outliers, but a skewed distribution that has no outliers will also pull the mean toward its long tail. Because the mean cannot resist the inﬂuence of extreme observations, we say that it is not a resistant measure of center.resistant measure APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE 2.1 Sports car gas mileage. Table 1.2 (page 12) gives the gas mileages for the 22 two-seater cars listed in the government’s fuel economy guide. (a) Find the mean highway gas mileage from the formula for the mean. Then enter the data into your calculator and use the calculator’s x button to obtain the mean. Verify that you get the same result. (b) The Honda Insight is an outlier that doesn’t belong with the other cars. Use your calculator to ﬁnd the mean of the 21 cars that remain if we leave out the Insight. How does the outlier change the mean? Measuring center: the median In Chapter 1, we used the midpoint of a distribution as an informal measure of center. The median is the formal version of the midpoint, with a speciﬁc rule for calculation. THE MEDIAN M The median M is the midpoint of a distribution, the number such that half the observations are smaller and the other half are larger. To ﬁnd the median of a distribution: 1. Arrange all observations in order of size, from smallest to largest. 2. If the number of observations n is odd, the median M is the center observation in the ordered list. Find the location of the median by counting (n + 1)/2 observations up from the bottom of the list. 3. If the number of observations n is even, the median M is the mean of the two center observations in the ordered list. The location of the median is again (n + 1)/2 from the bottom of the list. Note that the formula (n + 1)/2 does not give the median, just the location of the median in the ordered list. Medians require little arithmetic, so they are easy to ﬁnd by hand for small sets of data. Arranging even a moderate number of observations in order is very tedious, however, so that ﬁnding the median by hand for larger sets of data is unpleasant. Even simple calculators have an x P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286A-02 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:23 35Comparing the mean and the median button, but you will need to use software or a graphing calculator to automate ﬁnding the median. EXAMPLE 2.2 Finding the median: odd n What are the median earnings for our 15 college graduates? Here are the data ar- ranged in order: 4253030303132 35 50 50 50 55 60 74 110 The count of observations n = 15 is odd. The bold 35 is the center observation in the ordered list, with 7 observations to its left and 7 to its right. This is the median, M = 35. Because n = 15, our rule for the location of the median gives location of M = n + 1 2 = 16 2 = 8 That is, the median is the 8th observation in the ordered list. It is faster to use this rule than to locate the center by eye. EXAMPLE 2.3 Finding the median: even n How much does the high outlier affect the median? Drop the 110 from the ordered list and ﬁnd the median of the remaining 14 incomes. The data are 42530303031 32 35 50 50 50 55 60 74 There is no center observation, but there is a center pair. These are the bold 32 and 35 in the list, which have 6 observations to their left in the list and 6 to their right. The median is midway between these two observations: M = 32 + 35 2 = 33.5 With n = 14, the rule for locating the median in the list gives location of M = n + 1 2 = 15 2 = 7.5 The location 7.5 means “halfway between the 7th and 8th observations in the ordered list.” That agrees with what we found by eye. APPLET Comparing the mean and the median Examples 2.1 to 2.3 illustrate an important difference between the mean and the median. The single high income pulls the mean up by $4700. It moves the median by only $1500. The median, unlike the mean, is resistant. If the high earner’s income rose from 110 to 1100 (that is, from $110,000 to $1,100,000) the median would not change at all. The 1100 just counts as one observation above the center, no matter how far above the center it lies. The mean uses the actual value of each observation and so will chase a single large observa- tion upward. The Mean and Median applet is an excellent way to compare the resistance of M and x.

If the distribution is exactly symmetric, the mean and median are exactly the same. In a skewed distribution, the mean is farther out in the long tail than is the median. Distributions of incomes are usually skewed to the right—there are many modest incomes and a few very high incomes. For example, the Census Bureau survey in March 2002 interviewed 16,018 people aged 25 to 65 who were in the labor force full-time in 2001 and who were college graduates but had only a bachelor’s degree. We used 15 of these 16,018 incomes to introduce the mean and median. The median income for the entire group was $45,769. The mean of the same 16,018 incomes was much higher, $59,852. Reports about incomes and other strongly skewed distributions usually give the median (“midpoint”) rather than the mean (“arithmetic average”). However, a county that is about to impose a tax of 1% on the incomes of its residents cares about the mean income, not the median. The tax revenue will be 1% of total income, and the total is the mean times the number of residents. The mean and median measure center in different ways, and both are useful.

How do his career mean and median number of home runs change when we drop the record 73? What general fact about the mean and median does your result illustrate? Measuring spread: the quartiles The mean and median provide two different measures of the center of a distri- bution. But a measure of center alone can be misleading. The Census Bureau P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286A-02 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:23 37Measuring spread: the quartiles reports that in 2001 the median income of American households was $42,228. Half of all households had incomes below $42,228, and half had higher in- comes. The mean income of these same households was $58,208. The mean is higher than the median because the distribution of incomes is skewed to the right. But the median and mean don’t tell the whole story. The bottom 20% of households had incomes less than $17,970 and households in the top 5% took in more than $150,499.2 We are interested in the spread or variability of incomes as well as their center. The simplest useful numerical description of a distribution consists of both a measure of center and a measure of spread. One way to measure spread is to give the smallest and largest observations. For example, the incomes of our 15 college graduates range from $4000 to $110,000. These single observations show the full spread of the data, but they may be outliers. We can improve our description of spread by also looking at thespreadofthe middlehalfofthe data.The quartiles mark out the middle half. Count up the ordered list of observations, starting from the smallest. The ﬁrst quartile lies one-quarter of the way up the list. The third quartile lies three- quarters of the way up the list. In other words, the ﬁrst quartile is larger than 25% of the observations, and the third quartile is larger than 75% of the ob- servations. The second quartile is the median, which is larger than 50% of the observations. That is the idea of quartiles. We need a rule to make the idea exact. The rule for calculating the quartiles uses the rule for the median. THE QUARTILES Q1 AND Q3 To calculate the quartiles: 1. Arrange the observations in increasing order and locate the median M in the ordered list of observations. 2. The first quartile Q1 is the median of the observations whose position in the ordered list is to the left of the location of the overall median. 3. The third quartile Q3 is the median of the observations whose position in the ordered list is to the right of the location of the overall median. Here are examples that show how the rules for the quartiles work for both odd and even numbers of observations. EXAMPLE 2.4 Finding the quartiles: odd n Our sample of 15 incomes of college graduates, arranged in increasing order, is 4253030303132 35 50 50 50 55 60 74 110 There is an odd number of observations, so the median is the middle one, the bold 35 in the list. The ﬁrst quartile is the median of the 7 observations to the left of the P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286A-02 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:23 38 CHAPTER 2 \u0001 Describing Distributions with Numbers median. This is the 4th of these 7 observations, so Q1 = 30. If you want, you can use the recipe for the location of the median with n = 7: location of Q1 = n + 1 2 = 7 + 1 2 = 4 The third quartile is the median of the 7 observations to the right of the median, Q3 = 55. The overall median is left out of the calculation of the quartiles when there is an odd number of observations. Notice that the quartiles are resistant. For example, Q3 would have the same value if the outlier were 1100 rather than 110. EXAMPLE 2.5 Finding the quartiles: even n Here, from the same government survey, are the earnings in 2001 of 16 randomly chosen people who have high school diplomas but no college. For convenience we have arranged the incomes in increasing order. 56121920212224 | 25 31 32 40 43 43 47 67 There is an even number of observations, so the median lies midway between the middle pair, the 8th and 9th in the list. Its value is M = 24.5. We have marked the location of the median by |. The ﬁrst quartile is the median of the ﬁrst 8 observations, because these are the observations to the left of the location of the median. Check that Q1 = 19.5and Q3 = 41.5. When the number of observations is even, all the observations enter into the calculation of the quartiles. Be careful when, as in these examples, several observations take the same numerical value. Write down all of the observations and apply the rules just as if they all had distinct values. Some software packages use a slightly different rule to ﬁnd the quartiles, so computer results may be a bit different from your own work. Don’t worry about this. The differences will always be too small to be important. The five-number summary and boxplots The smallest and largest observations tell us little about the distribution as a whole, but they give information about the tails of the distribution that is missing if we know only Q1, M, and Q3. To get a quick summary of both center and spread, combine all ﬁve numbers. THE FIVE-NUMBER SUMMARY The five-number summary of a distribution consists of the smallest observation, the ﬁrst quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the largest observation, written in order from smallest to largest.

The ﬁve-number summary of a distribution leads to a new graph, the boxplot. Figure 2.2 shows boxplots for the comparison of earnings. BOXPLOT A boxplot is a graph of the ﬁve-number summary. \u0001 A central box spans the quartiles Q1 and Q3. \u0001 A line in the box marks the median M. \u0001 Lines extend from the box out to the smallest and largest observations.

Be sure to include a numerical scale in the graph. When you look at a boxplot, ﬁrst locate the median, which marks the center of the distribution. Then look at the spread. The quartiles show the spread of the middle half of the data, and the extremes (the smallest and largest observations) show the spread of the entire data set. We see from Figure 2.2 that holders of a bachelor’s degree as a group earn considerably more than people with no education beyond high school. For example, the ﬁrst quartile for college graduates is higher than the median for high school grads. The spread of the middle half of incomes (the box in the boxplot) is roughly the same for both groups. A boxplot also gives an indication of the symmetry or skewness of a dis- tribution. In a symmetric distribution, the ﬁrst and third quartiles are equally distant from the median. In most distributions that are skewed to the right, on the other hand, the third quartile will be farther above the median than the ﬁrst quartile is below it. That is the case for both distributions in Figure 2.2. The extremes behave the same way, but remember that they are just single observations and may say little about the distribution as a whole.

Measuring spread: the standard deviation The ﬁve-number summary is not the most common numerical description of a distribution. That distinction belongs to the combination of the mean to mea- sure center and the standard deviation to measure spread. The standard deviation measures spread by looking at how far the observations are from their mean. THE STANDARD DEVIATION s The variance s2 of a set of observations is an average of the squares of the deviations of the observations from their mean. In symbols, the variance of n observations x1, x2,..., xn is s 2 = (x1 − x) 2 + (x2 − x) 2 + ··· + (xn − x) 2 n − 1 or, more compactly, s 2 = 1 n − 1 ∑ (xi − x) 2 The standard deviation s is the square root of the variance s 2: s = √ 1 n − 1 ∑ (xi − x)2 In practice, use software or your calculator to obtain the standard deviation from keyed-in data. Doing an example step-by-step will help you understand how the variance and standard deviation work, however. EXAMPLE 2.6 Calculating the standard deviation A person’s metabolic rate is the rate at which the body consumes energy. Metabolic rate is important in studies of weight gain, dieting, and exercise. Here are the metabolic rates of 7 men who took part in a study of dieting. (The units are calo- ries per 24 hours. These are the same calories used to describe the energy content of foods.) 1792 1666 1362 1614 1460 1867 1439 P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286A-02 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:23 43Measuring spread: the standard deviation The researchers reported x and s for these men. First ﬁnd the mean: x = 1792 + 1666 + 1362 + 1614 + 1460 + 1867 + 1439 7 = 11,200 7 = 1600 calories Figure 2.3 displays the data as points above the number line, with their mean marked by an asterisk (∗). The arrows mark two of the deviations from the mean. These deviations show how spread out the data are about their mean. They are the starting point for calculating the variance and the standard deviation.

The number n − 1 is called the degrees of freedom of the variance or standard deviation. Many calculators of-degrees of freedom fer a choice between dividing by n and dividing by n − 1, so be sure to use n − 1. More important than the details of hand calculation are the properties that determine the usefulness of the standard deviation: \u0001 s measures spread about the mean and should be used only when the mean is chosen as the measure of center. \u0001 s = 0 only when there is no spread. This happens only when all observations have the same value. Otherwise, s > 0. As the observations become more spread out about their mean, s gets larger. \u0001 s has the same units of measurement as the original observations. For example, if you measure metabolic rates in calories, s is also in calories. This is one reason to prefer s to the variance s 2, which is in squared calories. \u0001 Like the mean x, s is not resistant. Strong skewness or a few outliers can greatly increase s . For example, the standard deviation of the incomes for our 15 college graduates is 24.9. (Use your calculator to verify this.) If we omit the high outlier, the standard deviation drops to 17.7. You may rightly feel that the importance of the standard deviation is not yet clear. We will see in the next chapter that the standard deviation is the natural measure of spread for an important class of symmetric distributions, the Normal distributions. The usefulness of many statistical procedures is tied to distribu- tions of particular shapes. This is certainly true of the standard deviation. Choosing measures of center and spread How do we choose between the ﬁve-number summary and x and s to describe the center and spread of a distribution? Because the two sides of a strongly skewed distribution have different spreads, no single number such as s describes the spread well. The ﬁve-number summary, with its two quartiles and two ex- tremes, does a better job. CHOOSING A SUMMARY The ﬁve-number summary is usually better than the mean and standard deviation for describing a skewed distribution or a distribution with strong outliers. Use x and s only for reasonably symmetric distributions that are free of outliers. Do remember that a graph gives the best overall picture of a distribution. Numerical measures of center and spread report speciﬁc facts about a distribu- tion, but they do not describe its entire shape. Numerical summaries do not disclose the presence of multiple peaks or gaps, for example. Exercise 2.9 shows how misleading numerical summaries can be. Always plot your data.

The level of various substances in the blood inﬂuences our health.

(a) Find the mean from its deﬁnition. That is, ﬁnd the sum of the 6 observations and divide by 6. (b) Find the standard deviation from its deﬁnition. That is, ﬁnd the deviations of each observation from the mean, square the deviations, then obtain the variance and the standard deviation. Example 2.6 shows the method. (c) Now enter the data into your calculator and use the mean and standard deviation buttons to obtain x and s . Do the results agree with your hand calculations? 2.9 x and s are not enough. The mean x and standard deviation s measure center and spread but are not a complete description of a distribution. Data sets with different shapes can have the same mean and standard deviation. To demonstrate this fact, use your calculator to ﬁnd x and s for these two small data sets. Then make a stemplot of each and comment on the shape of each distribution.

All the outputs agree that M = 4.7. The ﬁrst quartile by our rule is the median of the ﬁrst 25; that is, it is the 13th in the ordered list, Q1 = 2.1. Only the TI-83 gives this answer. Minitab and Excel don’t give 2.1, and they differ from each other. The differences are small: the three results are 2.08, 2.1, and 2.175. That’s a reminder that there are several rules for exactly determining the quartiles. Our rule is simplest for hand computation. Results from the various rules are always close to each other, so to describe data you should just use the answer your technology gives you. Chapter 2 SUMMARY A numerical summary of a distribution should report its center and its spread or variability. The mean x and the median M describe the center of a distribution in different ways. The mean is the arithmetic average of the observations, and the median is the midpoint of the values. When you use the median to indicate the center of the distribution, describe its spread by giving the quartiles. The first quartile Q1 has one-fourth of the observations below it, and the third quartile Q3 has three-fourths of the observations below it. The five-number summary consisting of the median, the quartiles, and the high and low extremes provides a quick overall description of a distribution. The median describes the center, and the quartiles and extremes show the spread. Boxplots based on the ﬁve-number summary are useful for comparing several distributions. The box spans the quartiles and shows the spread of the central half of the distribution. The median is marked within the box. Lines extend from the box to the extremes and show the full spread of the data. The variance s2 and especially its square root, the standard deviation s, are common measures of spread about the mean as center. The standard deviation s is zero when there is no spread and gets larger as the spread increases. A resistant measure of any aspect of a distribution is relatively unaffected by changes in the numerical value of a small proportion of the total number of observations, no matter how large these changes are. The median and quartiles are resistant, but the mean and the standard deviation are not.

They are most useful for the Normal distributions introduced in the next chapter. The ﬁve-number summary is a better description for skewed distributions. Numerical summaries do not fully describe the shape of a distribution. Always plot your data. Chapter 2 EXERCISES 2.11 Incomes of college grads.

Table 1.6 (page 29) gives the number of medical doctors per 100,000 people in each state. Exercise 1.29 (page 28) asked you to plot the data. The distribution is right-skewed with several high outliers. (a) Do you expect the mean to be greater than the median, about equal to the median, or less than the median? Why? Calculate x and M and verify your expectation. (b) The District of Columbia is a high outlier at 758 M.D.’s per 100,000 residents. If you remove D.C. because it is a city rather than a state, do you expect x or M to change more? Why?

Breast-feeding mothers secrete calcium into their milk. Some of the calcium may come from their bones, so mothers may lose bone mineral. Researchers compared 47 breast-feeding women with 22 women of similar age who were neither pregnant nor lactating. They measured the percent change in the mineral content of the women’s spines over three months.

In 1798 the English scientist Henry Cavendish measured the density of the earth with great care. It is common practice to repeat careful measurements several times and use the mean as the ﬁnal result. Cavendish repeated his work 29 times. Here are his results (the data give the density of the earth as a multiple of the density of water): 6 5.50 5.61 4.88 5.07 5.26 5.55 5.36 5.29 5.58 5.65 5.57 5.53 5.62 5.29 5.44 5.34 5.79 5.10 5.27 5.39 5.42 5.47 5.63 5.34 5.46 5.30 5.75 5.68 5.85 Present these measurements with a graph of your choice.

Whether an observation is an outlier is a matter of judgment: does it appear to clearly stand apart from the rest P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286A-02 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:23 53Chapter 2 Exercises TABLE 2.5 2002 salaries for the Chicago Cubs baseball team Player Salary Player Salary Player Salary Sammy Sosa $15,000,000 Jason Bere $3,400,000 Donovan Osborne $450,000 Fred McGriff $7,250,000 Jeff Fassero $2,800,000 Kyle Farnsworth $410,000 Todd Hundley $6,500,000 Tom Gordon $2,800,000 Robert Machado $277,500 Moises Alou $6,000,000 Matt Clement $2,500,000 Roosevelt Brown $255,000 Jon Lieber $5,833,333 Joe Girardi $1,500,000 Augie Ojeda $240,000 Alex Gonzalez $4,250,000 Jesus Sanchez $1,425,000 Joe Borowski $235,000 Kerry Wood $3,695,000 Delino DeShields $1,250,000 Corey Patterson $227,500 Antonio Alfonseca $3,550,000 Chris Stynes $1,250,000 Mark Bellhorn $224,000 Bill Mueller $3,450,000 Darren Lewis $500,000 Juan Cruz $215,000 Will Ohman $203,500 of the distribution? When large volumes of data are scanned automatically, however, we need a rule to pick out suspected outliers. The most common rule is the 1.5IQR rule. The interquartile range is the distance 1.5IQR rule between the two quartiles, IQR = Q3 − Q1. This is the spread of the interquartile range middle half of the data. A point is a suspected outlier if it lies more than 1.5IQR below the ﬁrst quartile Q1 or above the third quartile Q3. Exercises 2.26 to 2.28 ask you to apply this rule. 2.26 A high income.

Adding a 0 in the center of each number, the next set becomes 100,001 100,002 100,003 The standard deviation remains s = 1 as more 0s are added. Use your calculator or software to ﬁnd the standard deviation of these numbers, adding extra 0s until you get an incorrect answer. How soon did you go wrong? This demonstrates that calculators and software cannot handle an arbitrary number of digits correctly. 2.31 You create the data. Create a set of 5 positive numbers (repeats allowed) that have median 10 and mean 7. What thought process did you use to create your numbers? 2.32 You create the data.

Go to the Census Bureau Web site, www.census.gov , click on “Income,” and open the latest issue of the annual publication Money Income in the United States. The tables in this publication contain lots of detail. One set of tables compares the distributions of incomes among households by ethnicity (white, black, Asian and Paciﬁc Islander, and Hispanic origin). What is the median household income for each group? How closely can you ﬁnd the quartiles from the information given? Make partial boxplots—just the central box—to compare the four distributions. What do the data show? APPLET 2.34 Internet access. You can use the One-Variable Statistical Calculator applet in place of a calculator or software to do both calculations (x and s and the ﬁve-number summary) and graphs (histograms and stemplots). The applet is more convenient than most calculators. It is less convenient than good software because, depending on your browser, it may be difﬁcult to enter new data sets in one operation and to print output. Exercise 2.12 (page 48) gives the monthly fees paid for Internet access by a random sample of customers of commercial Internet service providers. This data set is one of those stored in the applet.

(a) The shape of the distribution ﬁts the fact that Old Faithful has two reservoirs of water, which can erupt either separately or together. Explain why the shape matches this fact. Also explain why neither x and s nor the ﬁve-number summary is a good description of this distribution. (b) Use your judgment, based on the histogram, to divide the eruptions into two clusters. What is the shape of the distribution of eruption lengths in each cluster? Give numerical descriptions of both clusters and compare the two. EESEE 2.39 Truth in calories. The EESEE story “Counting Calories” presents data from a study showing that foods advertised as “low calorie” and the like often contain more calories than the label states. One question was whether the degree of understatement of calories is the same for national brands, regional brands, and locally prepared foods. The EESEE story has data on the percent difference between true and label calories for many foods of each type. The differences are greater than zero when the true calories are higher than the label claims. Use both graphs and numerical summaries to compare the three types of food. What are your conclusions?

Density curves The median and mean of a density curve Normal distributions The 68--95--99.7 rule The standard Normal distribution Normal distribution calculations Finding a value given a proportion We now have a kit of graphical and numerical tools for describing distribu- tions. What is more, we have a clear strategy for exploring data on a single quantitative variable: 1. Always plot your data: make a graph, usually a histogram or a stemplot. 2. Look for the overall pattern (shape, center, spread) and for striking de- viations such as outliers. 3. Calculate a numerical summary to brieﬂy describe center and spread. Here is one more step to add to this strategy: 4. Sometimes the overall pattern of a large number of observations is so regular that we can describe it by a smooth curve. Density curves Figure 3.1 is a histogram of the scores of all 947 seventh-grade students in Gary, Indiana, on the vocabulary part of the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. 1 Scores of many students on this national test have a quite regular distribution. The histogram is symmetric, and both tails fall off quite smoothly from a single center peak. There are no large gaps or obvious outliers. The smooth curve drawn through the tops of the histogram bars in Figure 3.1 is a good description of the overall pattern of the data. The curve is a mathematical model for the distribution.mathematical model A mathematical model is an idealized description. It gives a compact picture 56 P1: FBQ PB286A-03 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:29 57Density curves 2 4 6 8 10 12 Grade-equivalent vocabulary score Figure 3.1 Histogram of the vocabulary scores of all seventh-grade students in Gary, Indiana. The smooth curve shows the overall shape of the distribution. of the overall pattern of the data but ignores minor irregularities as well as any outliers. We will see that it is easier to work with the smooth curve in Figure 3.1 than with the histogram. The reason is that the histogram depends on our choice of classes, while with a little care we can use a curve that does not depend on any choices we make. Here’s how we do it. EXAMPLE 3.1 From histogram to density curve Our eyes respond to the areas of the bars in a histogram. The bar areas represent proportions of the observations. Figure 3.2(a) is a copy of Figure 3.1 with the leftmost bars shaded. The area of the shaded bars in Figure 3.2(a) represents the students with vocabulary scores 6.0 or lower. There are 287 such students, who make up the proportion 287/947 = 0.303 of all Gary seventh graders. Now concentrate on the curve drawn through the bars. In Figure 3.2(b), the area under the curve to the left of 6.0 is shaded. Adjust the scale of the graph so that the total area under the curve is exactly 1. This area represents the proportion 1, that is, all the observations. Areas under the curve then represent proportions of the observations. The curve is now a density curve. The shaded area under the density curve in Figure 3.2(b) represents the proportion of students with score 6.0 or lower. This area is 0.293, only 0.010 away from the histogram result. You can see that ar- eas under the density curve give quite good approximations of areas given by the histogram.

Figure 3.2(b) The proportion of scores less than or equal to 6.0 from the density curve is 0.293. DENSITY CURVE A density curve is a curve that \u0001 is always on or above the horizontal axis, and \u0001 has area exactly 1 underneath it. A density curve describes the overall pattern of a distribution. The area under the curve and above any range of values is the proportion of all observations that fall in that range. The density curve in Figures 3.1 and 3.2 is a Normal curve. Density curves,Normal curve like distributions, come in many shapes. Figure 3.3 shows two density curves: a symmetric Normal density curve and a right-skewed curve. A density curve of the appropriate shape is often an adequate description of the overall pattern of a distribution. Outliers, which are deviations from the overall pattern, are not described by the curve. Of course, no set of real data is exactly described by a density curve. The curve is an approximation that is easy to use and accurate enough for practical use. APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE 3.1 Sketch density curves. Sketch density curves that might describe distributions with the following shapes: P1: FBQ PB286A-03 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:29 59The median and mean of a density curve (a) Symmetric, but with two peaks (that is, two strong clusters of observations). (b) Single peak and skewed to the left. The median and mean of a density curve Our measures of center and spread apply to density curves as well as to actual sets of observations. The median and quartiles are easy. Areas under a density curve represent proportions of the total number of observations. The median is the point with half the observations on either side. So the median of a density curve is the equal-areas point, the point with half the area under the curve to its left and the remaining half of the area to its right. The quartiles divide the area under the curve into quarters. One-fourth of the area under the curve is to the left of the ﬁrst quartile, and three-fourths of the area is to the left of the third quartile. You can roughly locate the median and quartiles of any density curve by eye by dividing the area under the curve into four equal parts. Because density curves are idealized patterns, a symmetric density curve is exactly symmetric. The median of a symmetric density curve is therefore at its center. Figure 3.3(a) shows the median of a symmetric curve. It isn’t so easy to spot the equal-areas point on a skewed curve. There are mathematical ways of ﬁnding the median for any density curve. We did that to mark the median on the skewed curve in Figure 3.3(b). What about the mean? The mean of a set of observations is their arithmetic average. If we think of the observations as weights strung out along a thin rod, the mean is the point at which the rod would balance. This fact is also true of density curves. The mean is the point at which the curve would balance if made of solid material. Figure 3.4 illustrates this fact about the mean. A symmetric curve balances at its center because the two sides are identical. The mean and median of a symmetric density curve are equal, as in Figure 3.3(a). We know that the mean of a skewed distribution is pulled toward the long tail. Median and mean Figure 3.3(a) The median and mean of a symmetric density curve. Median Mean The long right tail pulls the mean to the right. Figure 3.3(b) The median and mean of a right-skewed density curve.

Figure 3.3(b) shows how the mean of a skewed density curve is pulled toward the long tail more than is the median. It’s hard to locate the balance point by eye on a skewed curve. There are mathematical ways of calculating the mean for any density curve, so we are able to mark the mean as well as the median in Figure 3.3(b). MEDIAN AND MEAN OF A DENSITY CURVE The median of a density curve is the equal-areas point, the point that divides the area under the curve in half. The mean of a density curve is the balance point, at which the curve would balance if made of solid material. The median and mean are the same for a symmetric density curve. They both lie at the center of the curve. The mean of a skewed curve is pulled away from the median in the direction of the long tail. We can roughly locate the mean, median, and quartiles of any density curve by eye. This is not true of the standard deviation. When necessary, we can once again call on more advanced mathematics to learn the value of the stan- dard deviation. The study of mathematical methods for doing calculations with density curves is part of theoretical statistics. Though we are concentrating on statistical practice, we often make use of the results of mathematical study. Because a density curve is an idealized description of the distribution of data, we need to distinguish between the mean and standard deviation of the den- sity curve and the mean x and standard deviation s computed from the actual observations. The usual notation for the mean of an idealized distribution is µ (the Greek letter mu). We write the standard deviation of a density curve as σmean µ (the Greek letter sigma).standard deviation σ APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE 3.2 A uniform distribution. Figure 3.5 displays the density curve of a uniform distribution. The curve takes the constant value 1 over the interval from 0 to 1 and is zero outside that range of values. This means that data described by this distribution take values that are uniformly spread between 0 and 1. Use areas under this density curve to answer the following questions.

What is the mean µ of the density curve pictured in Figure 3.5? What is the median? 3.4 Mean and median. Figure 3.6 displays three density curves, each with three points marked on them. At which of these points on each curve do the mean and the median fall? Normal distributions One particularly important class of density curves has already appeared in Figures 3.1 and 3.3(a). These density curves are symmetric, single-peaked, and bell-shaped. They are called Normal curves, and they describe Normal distri- Normal distributions butions. Normal distributions play a large role in statistics, but they are rather special and not at all “normal”in the sense of being average or natural. We cap- italize Normal to remind you that these curves are special. All Normal distribu- tions have the same overall shape. The exact density curve for a particular Nor- mal distribution is described by giving its mean µ and its standard deviation σ . The mean is located at the center of the symmetric curve and is the same as the median. Changing µ without changing σ moves the Normal curve along the horizontal axis without changing its spread. The standard deviation σ controls P1: FBQ PB286A-03 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:29 62 CHAPTER 3 \u0001 The Normal Distributions µ σ µ σ Figure 3.7 Two Normal curves, showing the mean µ and standard deviation σ . the spread of a Normal curve. Figure 3.7 shows two Normal curves with differ- ent values of σ . The curve with the larger standard deviation is more spread out. The standard deviation σ is the natural measure of spread for Normal dis- tributions. Not only do µ and σ completely determine the shape of a Normal curve, but we can locate σ by eye on the curve. Here’s how. Imagine that you are skiing down a mountain that has the shape of a Normal curve. At ﬁrst, you descend at an ever-steeper angle as you go out from the peak: Fortunately, before you ﬁnd yourself going straight down, the slope begins to grow ﬂatter rather than steeper as you go out and down: The points at which this change of curvature takes place are located at dis- tance σ on either side of the mean µ. You can feel the change as you run a pencil along a Normal curve, and so ﬁnd the standard deviation. Remember that µ and σ alone do not specify the shape of most distributions, and that the shape of density curves in general does not reveal σ . These are special proper- ties of Normal distributions. Why are the Normal distributions important in statistics? Here are three rea- sons. First, Normal distributions are good descriptions for some distributions of real data. Distributions that are often close to Normal include scores on tests taken by many people (such as SAT exams and many psychological tests), re- peated careful measurements of the same quantity, and characteristics of bi- ological populations (such as lengths of crickets and yields of corn). Second, Normal distributions are good approximations to the results of many kinds of chance outcomes, such as tossing a coin many times. Third, and most important, we will see that many statistical inference procedures based on Normal distri- butions work well for other roughly symmetric distributions. However, many sets of data do not follow a Normal distribution. Most income distributions, for P1: FBQ PB286A-03 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:29 63The 68--95--99.7 rule example, are skewed to the right and so are not Normal. Non-Normal data, like nonnormal people, not only are common but are sometimes more interesting than their Normal counterparts. The 68--95--99.7 rule Although there are many Normal curves, they all have common properties. In particular, all Normal distributions obey the following rule. THE 68–95–99.7 RULE In the Normal distribution with mean µ and standard deviation σ : \u0001 68% of the observations fall within σ of the mean µ. \u0001 95% of the observations fall within 2σ of µ. \u0001 99.7% of the observations fall within 3σ of µ. Figure 3.8 illustrates the 68–95–99.7 rule. By remembering these three num- bers, you can think about Normal distributions without constantly making de- tailed calculations. 0−1−2−31 2 3 99.7% of data 95% of data 68% of data Figure 3.8 The 68–95–99.7 rule for Normal distributions. EXAMPLE 3.2 Using the 68–95–99.7 rule: SAT scores The distribution of the scores of the more than 1.3 million high school seniors who took the SAT Reasoning (SAT I) verbal exam in 2002 is close to Normal with mean 504 and standard deviation 111.2 Figure 3.9 applies the 68–95–99.7 rule to SAT scores. P1: FBQ PB286A-03 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:29 64 CHAPTER 3 \u0001 The Normal Distributions 171 282 393 504 615 726 837 SAT verbal score 99.7% of data 95% of data 68% of data One standard deviation is 111. Figure 3.9 The 68–95–99.7 rule applied to the distribution of SAT verbal scores for 2002, with µ = 504 and σ = 111. Two standard deviations is 222 for this distribution. The 95 part of the 68–95– 99.7 rule says that the middle 95% of SAT verbal scores are between 504 − 222 and 504 + 222, that is, between 282 and 726. The other 5% of scores lie outside this range. Because the Normal distributions are symmetric, half of these scores are on the high side. So the highest 2.5% of SAT verbal scores are higher than 726. These facts are exactly true for Normal distributions. They are approximately true for SAT scores, whose distribution is approximately Normal. The 99.7 part of the 68–95–99.7 rule says that almost all scores (99.7% of them) lie between µ − 3σ and µ + 3σ . This range of scores is 171 to 837. In fact, SAT scores are only reported between 200 and 800. It is possible to score higher than 800, but the score will be reported as 800. That is, you don’t need a perfect paper to score 800 on the SAT. Because we will mention Normal distributions often, a short notation is helpful. We abbreviate the Normal distribution with mean µ and standard de- viation σ as N(µ, σ ). For example, the distribution of SAT verbal scores is N(504, 111).

(Hint: Draw the curve ﬁrst, locate the points where the curvature changes, then mark the horizontal axis.) 3.6 Heights of young women. The distribution of heights of women aged 20 to 29 is approximately Normal with mean 64 inches and standard deviation 2.7 inches. Use the 68–95–99.7 rule to answer the following questions. (a) Between what heights do the middle 95% of young women fall? (b) What percent of young women are taller than 61.3 inches? 3.7 Length of pregnancies. The length of human pregnancies from conception to birth varies according to a distribution that is approximately Normal with mean 266 days and standard deviation 16 days. Use the 68–95–99.7 rule to answer the following questions. (a) Between what values do the lengths of the middle 95% of all pregnancies fall? (b) How short are the shortest 2.5% of all pregnancies? The standard Normal distribution As the 68–95–99.7 rule suggests, all Normal distributions share many common properties. In fact, all Normal distributions are the same if we measure in units of size σ about the mean µ as center. Changing to these units is called stan- dardizing. To standardize a value, subtract the mean of the distribution and then divide by the standard deviation. STANDARDIZING AND z-SCORES If x is an observation from a distribution that has mean µ and standard deviation σ ,the standardized value of x is z = x − µ σ A standardized value is often called a z-score. He said, she said. The height and weight distributions in this chapter come from actual measurements by a government survey. Good thing that is. When asked their weight, almost all women say they weigh less than they really do. Heavier men also underreport their weight—but lighter men claim to weigh more than the scale shows. We leave you to ponder the psychology of the two sexes. Just remember that “say so” is no replacement for measuring. A z-score tells us how many standard deviations the original observation falls away from the mean, and in which direction. Observations larger than the mean are positive when standardized, and observations smaller than the mean are negative. EXAMPLE 3.3 Standardizing women’s heights The heights of young women are approximately Normal with µ = 64 inches and σ = 2.7 inches. The standardized height is z = height − 64 2.7 P1: FBQ PB286A-03 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:29 66 CHAPTER 3 \u0001 The Normal Distributions A woman’s standardized height is the number of standard deviations by which her height differs from the mean height of all young women. A woman 70 inches tall, for example, has standardized height z = 70 − 64 2.7 = 2.22 or 2.22 standard deviations above the mean. Similarly, a woman 5 feet (60 inches) tall has standardized height z = 60 − 64 2.7 =−1.48 or 1.48 standard deviations less than the mean height. If the variable we standardize has a Normal distribution, standardizing does more than give a common scale. It makes all Normal distributions into a sin- gle distribution, and this distribution is still Normal. Standardizing a variable that has any Normal distribution produces a new variable that has the standard Normal distribution. STANDARD NORMAL DISTRIBUTION The standard Normal distribution is the Normal distribution N(0, 1) with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Ifavariable x has any Normal distribution N(µ, σ ) with mean µ and standard deviation σ , then the standardized variable z = x − µ σ has the standard Normal distribution.

Say in simple language what information the z-scores give that the actual heights do not. Normal distribution calculations An area under a density curve is a proportion of the observations in a distribu- tion. Any question about what proportion of observations lie in some range of values can be answered by ﬁnding an area under the curve. Because all Normal distributions are the same when we standardize, we can ﬁnd areas under any Normal curve from a single table, a table that gives areas under the curve for the standard Normal distribution. EXAMPLE 3.4 Using the standard Normal distribution What proportion of all young women are less than 70 inches tall? This proportion is the area under the N(64, 2.7) curve to the left of the point 70. Because the stan- dardized height corresponding to 70 inches is z = x − µ σ = 70 − 64 2.7 = 2.22 this area is the same as the area under the standard Normal curve to the left of the point z = 2.22. Figure 3.10(a) shows this area. Calculators and software often give areas under Normal curves. You can do the work by hand using Table A in the front end covers, which gives areas under the standard Normal curve. Table entry = 0.9868 for z = 2.22 Table entry for z is always the area under the curve to the left of z. z = 2.22 Figure 3.10(a) The area under a standard Normal curve to the left of the point z = 2.22 is 0.9868.

The table entry for each value z is the area under the curve to the left of z. z Table entry is area to left of z EXAMPLE 3.5 Using the standard Normal table Problem: Find the proportion of observations from the standard Normal distribution that are less than 2.22. Solution: To ﬁnd the area to the left of 2.22, locate 2.2 in the left-hand column of Table A, then locate the remaining digit 2 as .02 in the top row. The entry opposite 2.2 and under .02 is 0.9868. This is the area we seek. Figure 3.10(a) illustrates the relationship between the value z = 2.22 and the area 0.9868. Because z = 2.22 is the standardized value of height 70 inches, the proportion of young women who are less than 70 inches tall is 0.9868 (more than 98%). Problem: Find the proportion of observations from the standard Normal distribution that are greater than −0.67. Solution: Enter Table A under z =−0.67. That is, ﬁnd −0.6 in the left-hand column and .07 in the top row. The table entry is 0.2514. This is the area to the left of −0.67. Because the total area under the curve is 1, the area lying to the right of −0.67 is 1 − 0.2514 = 0.7486. Figure 3.10(b) illustrates these areas. We can answer any question about proportions of observations in a Normal distribution by standardizing and then using the standard Normal table. Here is an outline of the method for ﬁnding the proportion of the distribution in any region. FINDING NORMAL PROPORTIONS 1. State the problem in terms of the observed variable x. 2.

EXAMPLE 3.6 Normal distribution calculations The level of cholesterol in the blood is important because high cholesterol levels may increase the risk of heart disease. The distribution of blood cholesterol levels in a large population of people of the same age and sex is roughly Normal. For 14-year- old boys, the mean is µ = 170 milligrams of cholesterol per deciliter of blood (mg/dl) and the standard deviation is σ = 30 mg/dl.4 Levels above 240 mg/dl may require medical attention. What percent of 14-year-old boys have more than 240 mg/dl of cholesterol? 1. State the problem. Call the level of cholesterol in the blood x. The variable x has the N(170, 30) distribution. We want the proportion of boys with x > 240. 2. Standardize. Subtract the mean, then divide by the standard deviation, to turn x into a standard Normal z: x > 240 x − 170 30 > 240 − 170 30 z > 2.33 Figure 3.11 shows the standard Normal curve with the area of interest shaded. 3. Use the table. From Table A, we see that the proportion of observations less than 2.33 is 0.9901. About 99% of boys have cholesterol levels less than 240. The area to the right of 2.33 is therefore 1 − 0.9901 = 0.0099. This is about 0.01, or 1%. Only about 1% of boys have high cholesterol. In a Normal distribution, the proportion of observations with x > 240 is the same as the proportion with x ≥ 240. There is no area under the curve and P1: FBQ PB286A-03 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:29 70 CHAPTER 3 \u0001 The Normal Distributions z = 2.33 Area = 0.0099 Area = 0.9901 Figure 3.11 Areas under the standard Normal curve for Example 3.6. exactly over 240, so the areas under the curve with x > 240 and x ≥ 240 are the same. This isn’t true of the actual data. There may be a boy with exactly 240 mg/dl of blood cholesterol. The Normal distribution is just an easy-to-use approximation, not a description of every detail in the actual data. The key to using either software or Table A to do a Normal calculation is to sketch the area you want, then match that area with the areas that the table or software gives you. Here is another example. EXAMPLE 3.7 More Normal distribution calculations What percent of 14-year-old boys have blood cholesterol between 170 and 240 mg/dl? 1. State the problem. We want the proportion of boys with 170 ≤ x ≤ 240. 2. Standardize: 170 ≤ x ≤ 240 170 − 170 30 ≤ x − 170 30 ≤ 240 − 170 30 0 ≤ z ≤ 2.33 Figure 3.12 shows the area under the standard Normal curve. 3. Use the table. The area between 2.33 and 0 is the area below 2.33 minus the area below 0. Look at Figure 3.12 to check this. From Table A, area between 0 and 2.33 = area below 2.33 − area below 0.00 = 0.9901 − 0.5000 = 0.4901 About 49% of boys have cholesterol levels between 170 and 240 mg/dl. Sometimes we encounter a value of z more extreme than those appearing in Table A. For example, the area to the left of z =−4isnot givendirectlyinthe table.

In each case, sketch a standard Normal curve and shade the area under the curve that is the answer to the question. (a) z < 2.85 (b) z > 2.85 (c) z > −1.66 (d) −1.66 < z < 2.85 3.11 How hard do locomotives pull? An important measure of the performance of a locomotive is its “adhesion,” which is the locomotive’s pulling force as a multiple of its weight. The adhesion of one 4400-horsepower diesel locomotive model varies in actual use according to a Normal distribution with mean µ = 0.37 and standard deviation σ = 0.04. (a) What proportion of adhesions measured in use are higher than 0.40? (b) What proportion of adhesions are between 0.40 and 0.50? (c) Improvements in the locomotive’s computer controls change the distribution of adhesion to a Normal distribution with mean µ = 0.41 and standard deviation σ = 0.02. Find the proportions in (a) and (b) after this improvement. Finding a value given a proportion Examples 3.6 and 3.7 illustrate the use of Table A to ﬁnd what proportion of the observations satisﬁes some condition, such as “blood cholesterol between P1: FBQ PB286A-03 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:29 72 CHAPTER 3 \u0001 The Normal Distributions 170 mg/dl and 240 mg/dl.” We may instead want to ﬁnd the observed value with a given proportion of the observations above or below it. To do this, use Table A backward. Find the given proportion in the body of the table, read the corresponding z from the left column and top row, then “unstandardize” to get the observed value. Here is an example. EXAMPLE 3.8 ‘‘Backward” Normal calculations Scores on the SAT verbal test in 2002 followed approximately the N(504, 111) dis- tribution. How high must a student score in order to place in the top 10% of all students taking the SAT? 1. State the problem.Wewanttoﬁnd theSAT score x with area 0.1 to its right under the Normal curve with mean µ = 504 and standard deviation σ = 111. That’s the same as ﬁnding the SAT score x with area 0.9 to its left. Figure 3.13 poses the question in graphical form. Because Table A gives the areas to the left of z-values, always state the problem in terms of the area to the left of x. 2. Use the table. Look in the body of Table A for the entry closest to 0.9. It is 0.8997. This is the entry corresponding to z = 1.28. So z = 1.28 is the standardized value with area 0.9 to its left. 3. Unstandardize to transform the solution from the z back to the original x scale. We know that the standardized value of the unknown x is z = 1.28. Area = 0.90 Area = 0.10 x = 504 z = 0 x = ? z = 1.28 Figure 3.13 Locating the point on a Normal curve with area 0.10 to its right, for Example 3.8. P1: FBQ PB286A-03 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:29 73Chapter 3 Summary So x itself satisﬁes x − 504 111 = 1.28 Solving this equation for x gives x = 504 + (1.28)(111) = 646.1 This equation should make sense: it says that x lies 1.28 standard deviations above the mean on this particular Normal curve. That is the “unstandardized” meaning of z = 1.28. We see that a student must score at least 647 to place in the highest 10%. Here is the general formula for unstandardizing a z-score. To ﬁnd the value x from the Normal distribution with mean µ and standard deviation σ corre- sponding to a given standard Normal value z,use x = µ + zσ The bell curve? Does the distribution of human intelligence follow the “bell curve” of a Normal distribution? Scores on IQ tests do roughly follow a Normal distribution. That is because a test score is calculated from a person’s answers in a way that is designed to produce a Normal distribution. To conclude that intelligence follows a bell curve, we must agree that the test scores directly measure intelligence. Many psychologists don’t think there is one human characteristic that we can call “intelligence” and can measure by a single test score. APPLYYOURKNOWLEDGE 3.12 Use Table A to ﬁnd the value z of a standard Normal variable that satisﬁes each of the following conditions. (Use the value of z from Table A that comes closest to satisfying the condition.) In each case, sketch a standard Normal curve with your value of z marked on the axis.

Scores on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale are approximately Normally distributed with µ = 100 and σ = 15. (a) What IQ scores fall in the lowest 25% of the distribution? (b) How high an IQ score is needed to be in the highest 5%? Chapter 3 SUMMARY We can sometimes describe the overall pattern of a distribution by a density curve. A density curve has total area 1 underneath it. An area under a density curve gives the proportion of observations that fall in a range of values. A density curve is an idealized description of the overall pattern of a distribution that smooths out the irregularities in the actual data. We write the mean of a density curve as µ and the standard deviation of a density curve as σ to distinguish them from the mean x and standard deviation s of the actual data. The mean, the median, and the quartiles of a density curve can be located by eye. The mean µ is the balance point of the curve. The median divides the area under the curve in half. The quartiles and the median divide the area P1: FBQ PB286A-03 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:29 74 CHAPTER 3 \u0001 The Normal Distributions under the curve into quarters. The standard deviation σ cannot be located by eye on most density curves. The mean and median are equal for symmetric density curves. The mean of a skewed curve is located farther toward the long tail than is the median. The Normal distributions are described by a special family of bell-shaped, symmetric density curves, called Normal curves. The mean µ and standard deviation σ completely specify a Normal distribution N(µ, σ ). The mean is the center of the curve, and σ is the distance from µ to the change-of-curvature points on either side. To standardize any observation x, subtract the mean of the distribution and then divide by the standard deviation. The resulting z-score z = x − µ σ says how many standard deviations x lies from the distribution mean. All Normal distributions are the same when measurements are transformed to the standardized scale. In particular, all Normal distributions satisfy the 68–95–99.7 rule, which describes what percent of observations lie within one, two, and three standard deviations of the mean. If x has the N(µ, σ ) distribution, then the standardized variable z = (x − µ)/σ has the standard Normal distribution N(0, 1) with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Table A gives the proportions of standard Normal observations that are less than z for many values of z. By standardizing, we can use Table A for any Normal distribution. Chapter 3 EXERCISES 3.14 Figure 3.14 shows two Normal curves, both with mean 0. Approximately what is the standard deviation of each of these curves? IQ test scores. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) is the most common “IQ test.”The scale of scores is set separately for each age group and is approximately Normal with mean 100 and standard deviation 15. Use this distribution and the 68–95–99.7 rule to answer Exercises 3.15 to 3.17. 3.15 About what percent of people have WAIS scores (a) above 100? (b) above 145? (c) below 85? 3.16 Retardation.

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) requires Division I athletes to score at least 820 on the combined mathematics and verbal parts of the SAT exam to compete in their ﬁrst college year. (Higher scores are required for students with poor high school grades.) In 2002, the scores of the 1.3 million students taking the SATs were approximately Normal with mean 1020 and standard deviation 207. What percent of all students had scores less than 820? 3.21 More NCAA rules. The NCAA considers a student a “partial qualiﬁer” eligible to practice and receive an athletic scholarship, but not P1: FBQ PB286A-03 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:29 76 CHAPTER 3 \u0001 The Normal Distributions to compete, if the combined SAT score is at least 720.

The heights of women aged 20 to 29 follow approximately the N(64, 2.7) distribution. Men the same age have heights distributed as N(69.3, 2.8). What percent of young women are taller than the mean height of young men? 3.23 Heights of men and women. The heights of women aged 20 to 29 follow approximately the N(64, 2.7) distribution. Men the same age have heights distributed as N(69.3, 2.8). What percent of young men are shorter than the mean height of young women? (Jim McGuire/Index Stock Imagery/PictureQuest) 3.24 Length of pregnancies. The length of human pregnancies from conception to birth varies according to a distribution that is approximately Normal with mean 266 days and standard deviation 16 days. (a) What percent of pregnancies last less than 240 days (that’s about 8 months)? (b) What percent of pregnancies last between 240 and 270 days (roughly between 8 months and 9 months)? (c) How long do the longest 20% of pregnancies last? 3.25 A surprising calculation. Changing the mean of a Normal distribution by a moderate amount can greatly change the percent of observations in the tails. Suppose that a college is looking for applicants with SAT math scores 750 and above. (a) In 2002, the scores of men on the math SAT followed the N(534, 116) distribution. What percent of men scored 750 or better? (b) Women’s SAT math scores that year had the N(500, 110) distribution. What percent of women scored 750 or better? You see that the percent of men above 750 is almost three times the percent of women with such high scores. 3.26 Grading managers. Many companies “grade on a bell curve” to compare the performance of their managers and professional workers. This forces the use of some low performance ratings, so that not all workers are listed as “above average.” Ford Motor Company’s “performance management process” for a time assigned 10% A grades, 80% B grades, and 10% C grades to the company’s 18,000 managers. Suppose that Ford’s performance scores really are Normally distributed. This year, managers with scores less than 25 received C’s and those with scores above 475 received A’s. What are the mean and standard deviation of the scores? 3.27 Weights aren’t Normal. The heights of people of the same sex and similar ages follow Normal distributions reasonably closely. Weights, on P1: FBQ PB286A-03 PB286-Moore-V3.cls March 4, 2003 18:29 77Chapter 3 Media Exercises the other hand, are not Normally distributed. The weights of women aged 20 to 29 have mean 141.7 pounds and median 133.2 pounds. The ﬁrst and third quartiles are 118.3 pounds and 157.3 pounds. What can you say about the shape of the weight distribution? Why? 3.28 Quartiles. The median of any Normal distribution is the same as its mean. We can use Normal calculations to ﬁnd the quartiles for Normal distributions. (a) What is the area under the standard Normal curve to the left of the ﬁrst quartile? Use this to ﬁnd the value of the ﬁrst quartile for a standard Normal distribution. Find the third quartile similarly. (b) Your work in (a) gives the z-scores for the quartiles of any Normal distribution. What are the quartiles for the lengths of human pregnancies? (Use the distribution in Exercise 3.24.) 3.29 Deciles. The deciles of any distribution are the points that mark off the lowest 10% and the highest 10%. On a density curve, these are the points with areas 0.1 and 0.9 to their left under the curve. (a) What are the deciles of the standard Normal distribution? (b) The heights of young women are approximately Normal with mean 64 inches and standard deviation 2.7 inches. What are the deciles of this distribution? Chapter 3 MEDIA EXERCISES The Normal Curve applet allows you to do Normal calculations quickly. It is somewhat limited by the number of pixels available for use, so that it can’t hit every value exactly. In the exercises below, use the closest available values. In each case, make a sketch of the curve from the applet marked with the values you used to answer the questions asked. APPLET 3.30 How accurate is 68–95–99.7? The 68–95–99.7 rule for Normal distributions is a useful approximation. To see how accurate the rule is, drag one ﬂag across the other so that the applet shows the area under the curve between the two ﬂags. (a) Place the ﬂags one standard deviation on either side of the mean. What is the area between these two values? What does the 68–95–99.7 rule say this area is? (b) Repeat for locations two and three standard deviations on either side of the mean. Again compare the 68–95–99.7 rule with the area given by the applet. APPLET 3.31 Where are the quartiles?

If the distribution is not Normal, brieﬂy describe its shape.

Explanatory and response variables Displaying relationships: scatterplots Interpreting scatterplots Adding categorical variables to scatterplots Measuring linear association: correlation Facts about correlation A medical study ﬁnds that short women are more likely to have heart at- tacks than women of average height, while tall women have the fewest heart attacks. An insurance group reports that heavier cars have fewer deaths per 10,000 vehicles registered than do lighter cars. These and many other statisti- cal studies look at the relationship between two variables. To understand such a relationship, we must often examine other variables as well. To conclude that shorter women have higher risk from heart attacks, for example, the researchers had to eliminate the effect of other variables such as weight and exercise habits. In this chapter we begin our study of relationships between variables. One of our main themes is that the relationship between two variables can be strongly inﬂuenced by other variables that are lurking in the background. Explanatory and response variables Because variation is everywhere, statistical relationships are overall tenden- cies, not ironclad rules. They allow individual exceptions. Although smokers on the average die younger than nonsmokers, some people live to 90 while smoking three packs a day. To study a relationship between two variables, we measure both variables on the same individuals. Often, we think that one of the variables explains or inﬂuences the other. 79 P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-04 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:48 80 CHAPTER 4 \u0001 Scatterplots and Correlation RESPONSE VARIABLE, EXPLANATORY VARIABLE A response variable measures an outcome of a study. An explanatory variable explains or inﬂuences changes in a response variable. You will often ﬁnd explanatory variables called independent variables, andindependent variable response variables called dependent variables. The idea behind this languagedependent variable is that the response variable depends on the explanatory variable. Because “independent” and “dependent” have other meanings in statistics that are unrelated to the explanatory-response distinction, we prefer to avoid those words. It is easiest to identify explanatory and response variables when we actually set values of one variable in order to see how it affects another variable. EXAMPLE 4.1 The effects of alcohol Alcohol has many effects on the body. One effect is a drop in body temperature. To study this effect, researchers give several different amounts of alcohol to mice, then measure the change in each mouse’s body temperature in the 15 minutes after taking the alcohol. Amount of alcohol is the explanatory variable, and change in body temperature is the response variable. When we don’t set the values of either variable but just observe both vari- ables, there may or may not be explanatory and response variables. Whether there are depends on how we plan to use the data. EXAMPLE 4.2 Voting patterns A political scientist looks at the Democrats’ share of the popular vote for president in each state in the two most recent presidential elections. She does not wish to explain one year’s data by the other’s, but rather to ﬁnd a pattern that may shed light on political conditions. The political scientist has two related variables, but she does not use the explanatory-response distinction. A political consultant looks at the same data with an eye to including the previous election result in a state as one of several explanatory variables in a model to predict how the state will vote in the next election. Now the earlier election result is an explanatory variable and the later result is a response variable. In Example 4.1, alcohol actually causes a change in body temperature. There is no cause-and-effect relationship between votes in different elections in Example 4.2. If there is a close relationship, however, we can use a state’s percent Democratic in the last election to help predict the next election. Chapter 5 discusses prediction. Prediction requires that we identify an explana- tory variable and a response variable. Some other statistical techniques ignore P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-04 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:48 81Explanatory and response variables this distinction. Do remember that calling one variable explanatory and the other response doesn’t necessarily mean that changes in one cause changes in the other. After you plot your data, think! The statistician Abraham Wald (1902–1950) worked on war problems during World War II. Wald invented some statistical methods that were military secrets until the war ended. Here is one of his simpler ideas. Asked where extra armor should be added to airplanes, Wald studied the location of enemy bullet holes in planes returning from combat. He plotted the locations on an outline of the plane. As data accumulated, most of the outline ﬁlled up. Put the armor in the few spots with no bullet holes, said Wald. That’s where bullets hit the planes that didn’t make it back. Most statistical studies examine data on more than one variable. Fortunately, statistical analysis of several-variable data builds on the tools we used to exam- ine individual variables. The principles that guide our work also remain the same: \u0001 First plot the data, then add numerical summaries. \u0001 Look for overall patterns and deviations from those patterns. \u0001 When the overall pattern is quite regular, use a compact mathematical model to describe it. APPLYYOURKNOWLEDGE 4.1 Explanatory and response variables? In each of the following situations, is it more reasonable to simply explore the relationship between the two variables or to view one of the variables as an explanatory variable and the other as a response variable? In the latter case, which is the explanatory variable and which is the response variable? (a) The amount of time a student spends studying for a statistics exam and the grade on the exam. (b) The weight in kilograms and height in centimeters of a person. (c) Inches of rain in the growing season and the yield of corn in bushels per acre. (d) A student’s scores on the SAT math exam and the SAT verbal exam. (e) A family’s income and the years of education their eldest child completes. 4.2 Coral reefs. How sensitive to changes in water temperature are coral reefs? To ﬁnd out, measure the growth of corals in aquariums where the water temperature is controlled at different levels. Growth is measured by weighing the coral before and after the experiment. What are the explanatory and response variables? Are they categorical or quantitative? 4.3 The risks of obesity. A study observes a large group of people over a 10-year period. The goal is to see if overweight and obese people are more likely to die during the decade than people who weigh less. Such studies can be misleading, because obese people are more likely to be inactive and to be poor. What is the explanatory variable and the response variable? What other variables are mentioned that may inﬂuence the relationship between the explanatory variable and the response variable?

The most useful graph for this purpose is a scatterplot. EXAMPLE 4.3 State SAT scores Some people use average SAT scores to rank state or local school systems. This is not proper, because the percent of high school students who take the SAT varies from place to place. Let’s examine the relationship between the percent of a state’s high school graduates who took the exam in 2002 and the state average SAT verbal score that year. We think that “percent taking” will help explain “average score.” Therefore, “per- cent taking” is the explanatory variable and “average score” is the response variable. We want to see how average score changes when percent taking changes, so we put percent taking (the explanatory variable) on the horizontal axis. Figure 4.1 is the scatterplot. Each point represents a single state. In Colorado, for example, 28% took the SAT, and the average SAT verbal score was 543. Find 28 on the x (horizontal) axis and 543 on the y (vertical) axis. Colorado appears as the point (28, 543) above 28 and to the right of 543. Figure 4.1 shows how to locate Colorado’s point on the plot. 010 20 30 40 Percent of high school grads taking SAT 50 60 70 80 90 100600580560540Mean SAT verbal score520500480460 This is the point for Colorado, where 28% took the SAT and the mean verbal score was 543.

The values of one variable appear on the horizontal axis, and the values of the other variable appear on the vertical axis. Each individual in the data appears as the point in the plot ﬁxed by the values of both variables for that individual. Always plot the explanatory variable, if there is one, on the horizontal axis (the x axis) of a scatterplot. As a reminder, we usually call the explanatory variable x and the response variable y.

(Chris Beddall/Papilio/CORBIS) Interpreting scatterplots To interpret a scatterplot, apply the strategies of data analysis learned in Chap- ters 1 to 3. EXAMINING A SCATTERPLOT In any graph of data, look for the overall pattern and for striking deviations from that pattern. You can describe the overall pattern of a scatterplot by the form, direction, and strength of the relationship. An important kind of deviation is an outlier, an individual value that falls outside the overall pattern of the relationship.

In the cluster at the right of the plot, 52% or more of high school graduates take the SAT, and the average scores are low. The states in the cluster at the left have higher SAT scores and no more than 36% of graduates take the test. There are no clear outliers. That is, no points fall clearly outside the clusters. What explains the clusters? There are two widely used college entrance exams, the SAT and the ACT Assessment exam. Each state favors one or the other. The left cluster in Figure 4.1 contains the ACT states, and the SAT states make up the right cluster. In ACT states, most students who take the SAT are applying to a selective college that requires SAT scores. This select group of students has a higher average score than the much larger group of students who take the SAT in SAT states. The relationship in Figure 4.1 also has a clear direction: states in which a higher percent of students take the SAT tend to have lower average scores. This is a negative association between the two variables. POSITIVE ASSOCIATION, NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION Two variables are positively associated when above-average values of one tend to accompany above-average values of the other, and below-average values also tend to occur together. Two variables are negatively associated when above-average values of one tend to accompany below-average values of the other, and vice versa. The strength of a relationship in a scatterplot is determined by how closely the points follow a clear form. The overall relationship in Figure 4.1 is not strong—states with similar percents taking the SAT show quite a bit of scatter in their average scores. Here is an example of a stronger relationship with a clearer form. EXAMPLE 4.5 Counting carnivores Ecologists look at data to learn about nature’s patterns. One pattern they have found relates the size of a carnivore (body mass in kilograms) to how many of those carni- vores there are in an area. The right measure of “how many” is to count carnivores per 10,000 kilograms of their prey in the area. Table 4.1 gives data for 25 carnivore species.2 To see the pattern, plot carnivore abundance (response) against body mass (explanatory). Biologists often ﬁnd that patterns involving sizes and counts are sim- pler when we plot the logarithms of the data. Figure 4.2 does that—you can see that 1, 10, 100, and 1000 are equally spaced on the vertical scale. This scatterplot shows a moderately strong negative association. Bigger carni- vores are less abundant. The form of the association is linear. It is striking that ani- mals from many different parts of the world should ﬁt so simple a pattern. We could use the straight-line pattern to predict the abundance of another carnivore species from its body mass.

Describe the form, direction, and strength of the relationship between number of new sparrowhawks in a colony and percent of returning adults, as displayed in your plot from Exercise 4.4. For short-lived birds, the association between these variables is positive: changes in weather and food supply drive the populations of new and returning birds up or down together. For long-lived territorial birds, on the other hand, the association is negative because returning birds claim their territories in the colony and don’t leave room for new recruits.

Adding categorical variables to scatterplots The South long lagged behind the rest of the United States in the performance of its schools. Efforts to improve education have reduced the gap.

Some are ACT states and some are SAT states, but neither group has markedly low SAT scores. The South no longer underperforms, at least as measured by SAT scores. Dividing the states into “southern” and “nonsouthern” introduces a third variable into the scatterplot. This is a categorical variable that has only two values. The two values are displayed by the two different plotting colors.

Linear relations are particularly important because a straight line is a simple pattern that is quite common. We say a lin- ear relation is strong if the points lie close to a straight line, and weak if they are widely scattered about a line. Our eyes are not good judges of how strong a linear relationship is. The two scatterplots in Figure 4.4 depict exactly the same data, but the lower plot is drawn smaller in a large ﬁeld. The lower plot seems to show a stronger linear relationship. Our eyes can be fooled by chang- ing the plotting scales or the amount of white space around the cloud of points in a scatterplot.5 We need to follow our strategy for data analysis by using a numerical measure to supplement the graph. Correlation is the measure we use. CORRELATION The correlation measures the direction and strength of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables. Correlation is usually written as r . Suppose that we have data on variables x and y for n individuals. The values for the ﬁrst individual are x1 and y1, the values for the second individual are x2 and y2, and so on. The means and standard deviations of the two variables are x and s x for the x-values, and y and s y for the y-values. The correlation r between x and y is r = 1 n − 1 ∑ ( xi − x s x )( yi − y s y ) P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-04 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:48 89Measuring linear association: correlation 60 80 100 120 140 40 160 60 80 100 120 140 x y 0 50 100 150 200 250 0 250 50 100 150 200 x y Figure 4.4 Two scatterplots of the same data. The straight-line pattern in the lower plot appears stronger because of the surrounding white space. Death from superstition? Is there a relationship between superstitious beliefs and bad things happening? Apparently there is. Chinese and Japanese people think the number 4 is unlucky, because when pronounced it sounds like the word for “death.” Sociologists looked at 15 years’ of death certiﬁcates for Chinese and Japanese Americans and for white Americans. Deaths from heart disease were notably higher on the fourth day of the month among Chinese and Japanese, but not among whites. The sociologists think the explanation is increased stress on “unlucky days.” As always, the summation sign \u0002 means “add these terms for all the indi- viduals.” The formula for the correlation r is a bit complex. It helps us see what correlation is, but in practice you should use software or a calculator that ﬁnds r from keyed-in values of two variables x and y. Exercise 4.8 asks you to calculate a correlation step-by-step from the deﬁnition to solidify its meaning. The formula for r begins by standardizing the observations. Suppose, for ex- ample, that x is height in centimeters and y is weight in kilograms and that we have height and weight measurements for n people. Then x and s x are the mean and standard deviation of the n heights, both in centimeters. The value xi − x s x P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-04 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:48 90 CHAPTER 4 \u0001 Scatterplots and Correlation is the standardized height of the i th person, familiar from Chapter 1. The stan- dardized height says how many standard deviations above or below the mean a person’s height lies. Standardized values have no units—in this example, they are no longer measured in centimeters. Standardize the weights also. The cor- relation r is an average of the products of the standardized height and the stan- dardized weight for the n people. APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE 4.8 Classifying fossils. Archaeopteryx is an extinct beast having feathers like a bird but teeth and a long bony tail like a reptile. Only six fossil specimens are known. Because these specimens differ greatly in size, some scientists think they belong to different species. We will examine some data. If the specimens belong to the same species and differ in size because some are younger than others, there should be a positive linear relationship between the lengths of a pair of bones from all individuals. An outlier from this relationship would suggest a different species. Here are data on the lengths in centimeters of the femur (a leg bone) and the humerus (a bone in the upper arm) for the ﬁve specimens that preserve both bones:6 Femur 38 56 59 64 74 Humerus 41 63 70 72 84 (a) Make a scatterplot. Do you think that all ﬁve specimens come from the same species? (b) Find the correlation r step-by-step. That is, ﬁnd the mean and standard deviation of the femur lengths and of the humerus lengths. (Use your calculator for means and standard deviations.) Then ﬁnd the ﬁve standardized values for each variable and use the formula for r . (c) Now enter these data into your calculator and use the calculator’s correlation function to ﬁnd r. Check that you get the same result as in (b). Facts about correlation The formula for correlation helps us see that r is positive when there is a pos- itive association between the variables. Height and weight, for example, have a positive association. People who are above average in height tend to also be above average in weight. Both the standardized height and the standardized weight are positive. People who are below average in height tend to also have P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-04 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:48 91Facts about correlation below-average weight. Then both standardized height and standardized weight are negative. In both cases, the products in the formula for r are mostly positive and so r is positive. In the same way, we can see that r is negative when the as- sociation between x and y is negative. More detailed study of the formula gives more detailed properties of r. Here is what you need to know in order to inter- pret correlation. 1. Correlation makes no distinction between explanatory and response variables. It makes no difference which variable you call x and which you call y in calculating the correlation. 2. Correlation requires that both variables be quantitative, so that it makes sense to do the arithmetic indicated by the formula for r .We cannot calculate a correlation between the incomes of a group of people and what city they live in, because city is a categorical variable. 3. Because r uses the standardized values of the observations, r does not change when we change the units of measurement of x, y, or both. Measuring height in inches rather than centimeters and weight in pounds rather than kilograms does not change the correlation between height and weight. The correlation r itself has no unit of measurement; it is just a number. 4. Positive r indicates positive association between the variables, and negative r indicates negative association. 5. The correlation r is always a number between −1 and 1. Values of r near 0 indicate a very weak linear relationship. The strength of the linear relationship increases as r moves away from 0 toward either −1 or 1. Values of r close to −1 or 1 indicate that the points in a scatterplot lie close to a straight line. The extreme values r =−1 and r = 1 occur only in the case of a perfect linear relationship, when the points lie exactly along a straight line. 6. Correlation measures the strength of only a linear relationship between two variables. Correlation does not describe curved relationships between variables, no matter how strong they are. 7. Like the mean and standard deviation, the correlation is not resistant: r is strongly affected by a few outlying observations. Use r with caution when outliers appear in the scatterplot. APPLET The scatterplots in Figure 4.5 illustrate how values of r closer to 1 or −1 correspond to stronger linear relationships. To make the meaning of r clearer, the standard deviations of both variables in these plots are equal, and the hor- izontal and vertical scales are the same. In general, it is not so easy to guess the value of r from the appearance of a scatterplot. Remember that changing the plotting scales in a scatterplot may mislead our eyes, but it does not change the correlation. To explore how extreme observations can inﬂuence r , use the Correlation and Regression applet.

Patterns closer to a straight line have correlations closer to 1 or −1. The real data we have examined also illustrate how correlation mea- sures the strength and direction of linear relationships. Figure 4.2 shows a strong negative linear relationship between the logarithms of body mass and abundance for carnivore species. The correlation is r =−0.9124. Figure 4.1 shows a weaker but still quite strong negative association between percent of students taking the SAT and the mean SAT verbal score in a state. The corre- lation is r =−0.8814. Do remember that correlation is not a complete description of two-variable data, even when the relationship between the variables is linear. You should give the means and standard deviations of both x and y along with the corre- lation. (Because the formula for correlation uses the means and standard de- viations, these measures are the proper choice to accompany a correlation.) Conclusions based on correlations alone may require rethinking in the light of a more complete description of the data.

The subjective nature of the scoring often results in controversy. We have the scores awarded by two judges, Marina and Steve, for a large number of performances. How well do they agree? Calculation shows that the correlation between their scores is r = 0.9, but the mean of Marina’s scores is 0.5 point lower than Steve’s mean. These facts do not contradict each other. They are simply different kinds of in- formation. The mean scores show that Marina awards lower scores than Steve. But because Marina gives every skater a score about 0.5 point lower than Steve, the cor- relation remains high. Adding or subtracting the same number to all values of either x or y does not change the correlation. If Marina and Steve both rate all skaters, the contest is fairly scored because they agree on which performances are better than others. The high r shows their agreement. But if Marina scores one skater and Steve another, we must add 0.5 point to Marina’s score to arrive at a fair comparison. APPLYYOURKNOWLEDGE 4.9 Changing the correlation.

If we think that a variable x may explain or even cause changes in another variable y, we call x an explanatory variable and y a response variable. A scatterplot displays the relationship between two quantitative variables measured on the same individuals. Mark values of one variable on the horizontal axis (x axis) and values of the other variable on the vertical axis (y axis). Plot each individual’s data as a point on the graph. Always plot the explanatory variable, if there is one, on the x axis of a scatterplot. Plot points with different colors or symbols to see the effect of a categorical variable in a scatterplot. In examining a scatterplot, look for an overall pattern showing the form, direction, and strength of the relationship, and then for outliers or other deviations from this pattern. Form: Linear relationships, where the points show a straight-line pattern, are an important form of relationship between two variables. Curved relationships and clusters are other forms to watch for. Direction: If the relationship has a clear direction, we speak of either positive association (high values of the two variables tend to occur together) or negative association (high values of one variable tend to occur with low values of the other variable.) Strength: The strength of a relationship is determined by how close the points in the scatterplot lie to a simple form such as a line. The correlation r measures the strength and direction of the linear association between two quantitative variables x and y. Although you can calculate a correlation for any scatterplot, r measures only straight-line relationships. Correlation indicates the direction of a linear relationship by its sign: r > 0 for a positive association and r < 0 for a negative association. Correlation always satisﬁes −1 ≤ r ≤ 1 and indicates the strength of a relationship by how close it is to −1 or 1. Perfect correlation, r =±1, occurs only when the points on a scatterplot lie exactly on a straight line. Correlation ignores the distinction between explanatory and response variables. The value of r is not affected by changes in the unit of measurement of either variable. Correlation is not resistant, so outliers can greatly change the value of r .

Often the percent of an animal species in the wild that survive to breed again is lower following a successful breeding season. This is part of nature’s self-regulation to keep population size stable.

Many mutual funds compare their performance with that of a benchmark, an index of the returns on all securities of the kind the fund buys. The Vanguard International Growth Fund, for example, takes as its benchmark the Morgan Stanley EAFE (Europe, Australasia, Far East) index of overseas stock market performance.

For a biology project, you measure the tail length (centimeters) and weight (grams) of 12 mice of the same variety.

If you measured length in inches instead of centimeters, what would be the new value of r ? 4.23 Statistics for investing. Investment reports now often include correlations. Following a table of correlations among mutual funds, a report adds: “Two funds can have perfect correlation, yet different levels of risk. For example, Fund A and Fund B may be perfectly correlated, yet Fund A moves 20% whenever Fund B moves 10%.” Write a brief explanation, for someone who knows no statistics, of how this can happen. Include a sketch to illustrate your explanation. 4.24 Nematodes and tomatoes. To demonstrate the effect of nematodes (microscopic worms) on plant growth, a student introduces different numbers of nematodes into 16 planting pots. He then transplants a tomato seedling into each pot. Here are data on the increase in height of the seedlings (in centimeters) 14 days after planting:13 Nematodes Seedling growth 0 10.8 9.1 13.5 9.2 1,000 11.1 11.1 8.2 11.3 5,000 5.4 4.6 7.4 5.0 10,000 5.8 5.3 3.2 7.5 (a) Make a scatterplot of the response variable (growth) against the explanatory variable (nematode count). Then compute the mean growth for each group of seedlings, plot the means against the nematode counts, and connect these four points with line segments.

How much corn per acre should a farmer plant to obtain the highest yield? Too few plants will give a low yield. On the other hand, if there are too many plants, they will compete with each other for moisture and nutrients, and yields will fall.

(b) Make a scatterplot of yield and planting rate. Use a scale of yields from 100 to 200 bushels per acre so that the pattern will be clear. (c) Describe the overall pattern of the relationship. Is it linear? Is there a positive or negative association, or neither? (d) Find the mean yield for each of the ﬁve planting rates. Plot each mean yield against its planting rate on your scatterplot and connect these ﬁve points with lines. This combination of numerical description and graphing makes the relationship clearer. What planting rate would you recommend to a farmer whose conditions were similar to those in the experiment? 4.26 The effect of changing units. Changing the units of measurement can dramatically alter the appearance of a scatterplot.

Then plot the new data on the same axes in a different color. The two plots look very different. (b) Nonetheless, the correlation is exactly the same for the two sets of measurements. Why do you know that this is true without doing any calculations? Find the two correlations to verify that they are the same.

There is some evidence that drinking moderate amounts of wine helps prevent heart attacks.

(b) Describe the form of the relationship. Is there a linear pattern? How strong is the relationship? (c) Is the direction of the association positive or negative? Explain in simple language what this says about wine and heart disease. Do you think these data give good evidence that drinking wine causes a reduction in heart disease deaths? Why? 4.28 Teaching and research. A college newspaper interviews a psychologist about student ratings of the teaching of faculty members. The psychologist says, “The evidence indicates that the correlation between the research productivity and teaching rating of faculty members is close to zero.” The paper reports this as “Professor McDaniel said that good researchers tend to be poor teachers, and vice versa.” Explain why the paper’s report is wrong. Write a statement in plain language (don’t use the word “correlation”) to explain the psychologist’s meaning. 4.29 Investment diversification. A mutual-fund company’s newsletter says, “A well-diversiﬁed portfolio includes assets with low correlations.” The newsletter includes a table of correlations between the returns on various classes of investments. For example, the correlation between municipal bonds and large-cap stocks is 0.50, and the correlation between municipal bonds and small-cap stocks is 0.21.

Each of the following statements contains a blunder. Explain in each case what is wrong.

The data plotted in Figure 4.1 came from the Web site of the College Board, www.collegeboard.com. At ﬁrst glance, this site seems to be of interest mainly to students applying to college and planning to take the SAT. If you can locate it, there is a mine of information about SAT scores. Try clicking on “For Education Professionals” and then on “College Bound Seniors.” You can then access a list of data tables. Use data from these to do one of these tasks: (a) Make a time plot of the average SAT verbal score of all students for as many past years as the data table allows. What trend or other pattern do you see? Has the trend changed over time? (b) Make a scatterplot of the mean SAT verbal and math scores for the states in a recent year. What overall pattern do you see? What is the correlation? Hawaii is often a mild outlier. What might explain Hawaii’s position on the plot? APPLET 4.32 Match the correlation. You are going to use the Correlation and Regression applet to make scatterplots with 10 points that have correlation close to 0.7. The lesson is that many patterns can have the same correlation. Always plot your data before you trust a correlation. (a) Stop after adding the ﬁrst two points. What is the value of the correlation? Why does it have this value? (b) Make a lower-left to upper-right pattern of 10 points with correlation about r = 0.7. (You can drag points up or down to adjust r after you have 10 points.) Make a rough sketch of your scatterplot.

Add one point far to the right and move it until the correlation is close to 0.7. Make a rough sketch of your scatterplot. (d) Make yet another scatterplot with 10 points in a curved pattern that starts at the lower left, rises to the right, then falls again at the far right. Adjust the points up or down until you have a quite smooth curve with correlation close to 0.7. Make a rough sketch of this scatterplot also. APPLET 4.33 Correlation is not resistant. Go to the Correlation and Regression applet. Click on the scatterplot to create a group of 10 points in the lower-left corner of the scatterplot with a strong straight-line pattern (correlation about 0.9). (a) Add one point at the upper right that is in line with the ﬁrst 10. How does the correlation change? (b) Drag this last point down until it is opposite the group of 10 points. How small can you make the correlation? Can you make the correlation negative? You see that a single outlier can greatly strengthen or weaken a correlation. Always plot your data to check for outlying points. EESEE 4.34 Brain size and IQ score. Do people with larger brains have higher IQ scores? A study looked at 40 volunteer subjects, 20 men and 20 women. Brain size was measured by magnetic resonance imaging. The EESEE story “Brain Size and Intelligence” gives the data. The MRI count is the number of “pixels” the brain covered in the image. IQ was measured by the Wechsler test that we met in Chapter 3. (a) Make a scatterplot of IQ score versus MRI count, using distinct symbols for men and women. In addition, ﬁnd the correlation between IQ and MRI for all 40 subjects, for the men alone, and for the women alone. (b) Men are larger than women on the average, so they have larger brains. How is this size effect visible in your plot? Find the mean MRI count for men and women to verify the difference. (c) Your result in (b) suggests separating men and women in looking at the relationship between brain size and IQ. Use your work in (a) to comment on the nature and strength of this relationship for women and for men. EESEE 4.35 Mercury in bass. Mercury in ﬁsh can make eating the ﬁsh unsafe. The EESEE story “Mercury in Florida’s Bass” contains data from 53 lakes in Florida. We are interested in the relationship between the mercury concentration in the ﬂesh of ﬁsh from a lake and various measures of water quality. EESEE asks you to examine several relationships. Start with this one: plot the standardized mercury concentration against the pH (the chemical measure of acidity versus alkalinity) for the 53 lakes. Give a brief verbal and numerical description of the relationship.

The least-squares regression line Using technology Facts about least-squares regression Residuals Influential observations Cautions about correlation and regression Association does not imply causation Linear (straight-line) relationships between two quantitative variables are easy to understand and quite common. In Chapter 4, we found linear relationships in settings as varied as sparrowhawk colonies, icicle growth, and heating a home. Correlation measures the direction and strength of these relationships. When a scatterplot shows a linear relationship, we would like to summarize the overall pattern by drawing a line on the scatterplot. A regression line summa- rizes the relationship between two variables, but only in a speciﬁc setting: one of the variables helps explain or predict the other. That is, regression describes a relationship between an explanatory variable and a response variable. REGRESSION LINE A regression line is a straight line that describes how a response variable y changes as an explanatory variable x changes. We often use a regression line to predict the value of y for a given value of x. EXAMPLE 5.1 Predicting new birds We saw in Exercise 4.4 (page 83) that there is a linear relationship between the percent x of adult sparrowhawks that return to a colony from the previous year and the number y of new adult birds that join the colony. The scatterplot in Figure 5.1 displays this relationship. 104 P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-05 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:52 105The least-squares regression lineNumber of new birds Percent of adults returning This regression line describes the overall pattern of the relationship. 020 40 60 80 1000510152025This is the predicted response for a colony with x = 60% returning. Figure 5.1 Data on 13 sparrowhawk colonies, with a regression line for predicting number of new birds from percent of returning birds. The dashed lines illustrate how to use the regression line to predict new birds in a colony with 60% returning. The correlation is r =−0.7485, so the straight-line pattern is moderately strong. The line on the plot is a regression line that describes the overall pattern. An ecologist wants to use the line, based on 13 colonies, to predict how many birds will join another colony, to which 60% of the adults from the previous year return. To predict new birds for 60% returning, ﬁrst locate 60 on the x axis. Then prediction go “up and over” as in the ﬁgure to ﬁnd the y that corresponds to x = 60. It appears from the graph that we predict around 13 or 14 new birds. The least-squares regression line Different people will draw different lines by eye on a scatterplot. This is es- pecially true when the points are widely scattered. We need a way to draw a regression line that doesn’t depend on our guess as to where the line should go. We will use the line to predict y from x, so the prediction errors we make are errors in y, the vertical direction in the scatterplot. If we predict 14 new birds for a colony with 60% returning birds and in fact 18 new birds join the colony, our prediction error is error = observed y − predicted y = 18 − 14 = 4 P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-05 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:52 106 CHAPTER 5 \u0001 Regression 65 70 75 80 Percent of adults returning468101214Number of new birds The observed response for x = 74 is y = 5. A good line for prediction makes these distances small. The predicted response for x = 74 is y = 9.438ˆ Figure 5.2 The least-squares idea. For each observation, ﬁnd the vertical distance of each point on the scatterplot from a regression line. The least-squares regression line makes the sum of the squares of these distances as small as possible. No line will pass exactly through all the points in the scatterplot. We want the vertical distances of the points from the line to be as small as possible. Figure 5.2 illustrates the idea. This plot shows four of the points from Figure 5.1, along with the line, on an expanded scale. The line passes above two of the points and below two of them. The vertical distances of the data points from the line appear as vertical line segments. There are many ways to make the collection of vertical distances “as small as possible.” The most common is the least-squares method. LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION LINE The least-squares regression line of y on x is the line that makes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances of the data points from the line as small as possible. One reason for the popularity of the least-squares regression line is that the problem of ﬁnding the line has a simple answer. We can give the recipe for the least-squares line in terms of the means and standard deviations of the two variables and their correlation. P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-05 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:52 107The least-squares regression line EQUATION OF THE LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION LINE We have data on an explanatory variable x and a response variable y for n individuals. From the data, calculate the means x and y and the standard deviations s x and s y of the two variables, and their correlation r . The least-squares regression line is the line ˆy = a + bx with slope b = r s y s x and intercept a = y − b x We write ˆy (read “y hat”) in the equation of the regression line to empha- size that the line gives a predicted response ˆy for any x. Because of the scatter of points about the line, the predicted response will usually not be exactly the same as the actually observed response y. In practice, you don’t need to calculate the means, standard deviations, and correlation ﬁrst. Software or your calcula- tor will give the slope b and intercept a of the least-squares line from keyed-in values of the variables x and y. You can then concentrate on understanding and using the regression line. EXAMPLE 5.2 Using a regression line The line in Figure 5.1 is in fact the least-squares regression line of new birds on percent of returning birds. Enter the data from Exercise 4.4 into your calculator and check that the equation of this line is ˆy = 31.9343 − 0.3040x The slope of a regression line is usually important for the interpretation of the slope data. The slope is the rate of change, the amount of change in ˆy when x increases by 1. The slope b =−0.3040 in this example says that for each additional percent of last year’s birds that return we predict about 0.3 fewer new birds. The intercept of the regression line is the value of ˆy when x = 0. Although we intercept need the value of the intercept to draw the line, it is statistically meaningful only when x can actually take values close to zero. In our example, x = 0 means that a colony disappears because no birds return. The line predicts that on the average 31.9 new birds will appear. This isn’t meaningful because a colony disappearing is a different setting than a colony with returning birds. The equation of the regression line makes prediction easy. Just substitute an prediction x-value into the equation. To predict new birds when 60% return, substitute x = 60: ˆy = 31.9343 − (0.3040)(60) = 31.9343 − 18.24 = 13.69 The actual number of new birds must be a whole number. Think of the prediction ˆy = 13.69 as an “on the average” value for many colonies with 60% returning birds.

Plot each ˆy above its x and draw the line through the two points. Using technology Least-squares regression is one of the most common statistical procedures. Any technology you use for statistical calculations will give you the least-squares line and related information.

Each output records the slope and intercept of the least-squares line. The software also provides information that we do not yet need, although we will use much of it later.

Once you understand the statistical ideas, you can read and work with almost any software output. APPLYYOURKNOWLEDGE 5.1 Verify our claims.

A study of king penguins looked for a relationship between how deep the penguins dive to seek food and how long they stay under water. 1 For all but the shallowest dives, there is a linear relationship that is different for different penguins. The study report gives a scatterplot for one penguin titled “The relation of dive duration (DD) to depth (D).” Duration DD is measured in minutes and depth D is in meters. The report then says, “The regression equation for this bird is: DD = 2.69 + 0.0138D.” (a) What is the slope of the regression line? Explain in speciﬁc language what this slope says about this penguin’s dives. (b) According to the regression line, how long does a typical dive to a depth of 200 meters last?

Facts about least-squares regression Regression toward the mean To “regress” means to go backward. Why are statistical methods for predicting a response from an explanatory variable called “regression”? Sir Francis Galton (1822–1911), who was the ﬁrst to apply regression to biological and psychological data, looked at examples such as the heights of children versus the heights of their parents. He found that the taller-than-average parents tended to have children who were also taller than average but not as tall as their parents. Galton called this fact “regression toward the mean,” and the name came to be applied to the statistical method. One reason for the popularity of least-squares regression lines is that they have many convenient special properties. Here are some facts about least-squares regression lines. Fact 1. The distinction between explanatory and response variables is essential in regression. Least-squares regression looks at the dis- tances of the data points from the line only in the y direction. If we reverse the roles of the two variables, we get a different least-squares regression line. EXAMPLE 5.3 The expanding universe Figure 5.4 is a scatterplot of data that played a central role in the discovery that the universe is expanding. They are the distances from earth of 24 spiral galaxies and the speed at which these galaxies are moving away from us, reported by the astronomer 0.50 1.0 1.5 2.0 –200 1000 200 400 600 800 Distance (in millions of parsecs)Velocity (in kilometers per second) 0 Figure 5.4 Scatterplot of Hubble’s data on the distance from earth of 24 galaxies and the velocity at which they are moving away from us. The two lines are the two least-squares regression lines: of velocity on distance (solid) and of distance on velocity (dashed).

Astronomers believe that there is in fact a perfect linear relationship, and that the scatter is caused by imperfect measurements. The two lines on the plot are the two least-squares regression lines. The regres- sion line of velocity on distance is solid. The regression line of distance on velocity is dashed. Regression of velocity on distance and regression of distance on velocity give different lines. In the regression setting you must know clearly which variable is ex- planatory. Fact 2. There is a close connection between correlation and the slope of the least-squares line. The slope is b = r s y s x This equation says that along the regression line, a change of one standard deviation in x corresponds to a change of r standard de- viations in y. When the variables are perfectly correlated (r = 1 or r =−1), the change in the predicted response ˆy is the same (in standard deviation units) as the change in x. Otherwise, because −1 ≤ r ≤ 1, the change in ˆy is less than the change in x.Asthe correlation grows less strong, the prediction ˆy moves less in response to changes in x. Fact 3. The least-squares regression line always passes through the point (x, y) on the graph of y against x. So the least-squares regression line of y on x is the line with slope rs y/s x that passes through the point (x, y). Fact 4. The correlation r describes the strength of a straight-line relation- ship. In the regression setting, this description takes a speciﬁc form: the square of the correlation, r 2, is the fraction of the variation in the values of y that is explained by the least-squares regression of y on x. The idea is that when there is a linear relationship, some of the variation in y is accounted for by the fact that as x changes it pulls y along with it. Look again at Figure 5.1 on page 105. The number of new birds joining a colony ranges from 5 to 20. Some of this variation in the response y is explained by the fact that the percent x of returning birds varies from 38% to 81%. As x moves from 38% to 81%, it pulls y with it along the line. You would guess a smaller number of new birds for a colony with 80% returning than for a colony with 40% returning. But there is also quite a bit of scatter above and below the line, variation that isn’t explained by the straight-line relationship between x and y. Although we won’t do the algebra, it is possible to break the total variation in the observed values of y into two parts. One part is the variation we expect as x moves and ˆy moves with it along the regression line. The other measures the variation of the data points about the line. The squared correlation r 2 is P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-05 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:52 112 CHAPTER 5 \u0001 Regression the ﬁrst of these as a fraction of the whole: r 2 = variation in ˆy as x pulls it along the line total variation in observed values of y EXAMPLE 5.4 Using r 2 In Figure 5.1, r =−0.7485 and r 2 = 0.5603. About 56% of the variation in new birds is accounted for by the linear relationship with percent returning. The other 44% is individual variation among colonies that is not explained by the linear rela- tionship. Figure 4.2 (page 85) shows a stronger linear relationship in which the points are more tightly concentrated along a line. Here, r =−0.9124 and r 2 = 0.8325. More than 83% of the variation in carnivore abundance is explained by regression on body mass. Only 17% is variation among species with the same mass. When you report a regression, give r 2 as a measure of how successful the regression was in explaining the response. All the outputs in Figure 5.3 include r 2, either in decimal form or as a percent. When you see a correlation, square it to get a better feel for the strength of the association. Perfect correlation (r =−1or r = 1) means the points lie exactly on a line. Then r 2 = 1 and all of the variation in one variable is accounted for by the linear relationship with the other variable. If r =−0.7or r = 0.7, r 2 = 0.49 and about half the variation is accounted for by the linear relationship. In the r 2 scale, correlation ±0.7 is about halfway between 0 and ±1. Facts 2, 3, and 4 are special properties of least-squares regression. They are not true for other methods of ﬁtting a line to data. APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE 5.4 Growing corn. Exercise 4.25 (page 99) gives data from an agricultural experiment. The purpose of the study was to see how the yield of corn changes as we change the planting rate (plants per acre). (a) Make a scatterplot of the data. (Use a scale of yields from 100 to 200 bushels per acre.) Find the least-squares regression line for predicting yield from planting rate and add this line to your plot. Why should we not use regression for prediction in this setting? (b) What is r 2? What does this value say about the success of the regression in predicting yield? (c) Even regression lines that make no practical sense obey Facts 1 to 4. Use the equation of the regression line you found in (a) to show that when x is the mean planting rate, the predicted yield ˆy is the mean of the observed yields. 5.5 Sports car gas mileage.

Find the mean city mileage and mean highway mileage for these cars. Use your regression line to predict the highway mileage for a car with city mileage equal to the mean for the group. Explain why you knew the answer before doing the prediction. 5.6 Comparing regressions. What is the value of r 2 for predicting highway from city mileage in Exercise 5.5? What value did you ﬁnd for predicting corn yield from planting rate in Exercise 5.4? Explain in simple language why if we knew only these two r 2-values, we would expect predictions using the regression line to be more satisfactory for gas mileage than for corn yield. Residuals One of the ﬁrst principles of data analysis is to look for an overall pattern and also for striking deviations from the pattern. A regression line describes the overall pattern of a linear relationship between an explanatory variable and a response variable. We see deviations from this pattern by looking at the scat- ter of the data points about the regression line. The vertical distances from the points to the least-squares regression line are as small as possible, in the sense that they have the smallest possible sum of squares. Because they repre- sent “left-over” variation in the response after ﬁtting the regression line, these distances are called residuals. RESIDUALS A residual is the difference between an observed value of the response variable and the value predicted by the regression line. That is, residual = observed y − predicted y = y − ˆy EXAMPLE 5.5 Predicting mental ability Does the age at which a child begins to talk predict later score on a test of mental ability? A study of the development of young children recorded the age in months at which each of 21 children spoke their ﬁrst word and their Gesell Adaptive Score, the result of an aptitude test taken much later. The data appear in Table 5.1. 3 Figure 5.5 is a scatterplot, with age at ﬁrst word as the explanatory variable x and Gesell score as the response variable y. Children 3 and 13, and also Children 16 and 21, have identical values of both variables. We use a different plotting symbol to show that one point stands for two individuals. The plot shows a negative associ- ation. That is, children who begin to speak later tend to have lower test scores than early talkers. The overall pattern is moderately linear. The correlation describes both the direction and the strength of the linear relationship. It is r =−0.640. The line on the plot is the least-squares regression line of Gesell score on age at ﬁrst word. Its equation is ˆy = 109.8738 − 1.1270x P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-05 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:52 114 CHAPTER 5 \u0001 Regression TABLE 5.1 Age at first word and Gesell score Child Age Score Child Age Score 115 95 11 7 113 226 71 12 9 96 310 83 13 10 83 49 91 14 11 84 5 15 102 15 11 102 620 87 16 10 100 718 93 17 12 105 8 11 100 18 42 57 9 8 104 19 17 121 10 20 94 20 11 86 21 10 100 010 20 30 40 50 40 140 60 Child 19 Child 18 = Two children 80 100 120 Age at first word (months)Gesell Adaptive Score = One child Figure 5.5 Scatterplot of Gesell Adaptive Score versus the age at ﬁrst word for 21 children, from Table 5.1. The line is the least-squares regression line for predicting Gesell score from age at ﬁrst word. For Child 1, who ﬁrst spoke at 15 months, we predict the score ˆy = 109.8738 − (1.1270)(15) = 92.97 This child’s actual score was 95. The residual is residual = observed y − predicted y = 95 − 92.97 = 2.03 The residual is positive because the data point lies above the line. P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-05 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:52 115Residuals 010 20 30 40 50 –20 30 –10 Child 19 Child 18 = Two children 0 10 20 Age at first word (months)Residual = One child Figure 5.6 Residual plot for the regression of Gesell score on age at ﬁrst word. Child 19 is an outlier. Child 18 is an inﬂuential observation that does not have a large residual. There is a residual for each data point. Finding the residuals is a bit unpleas- ant because you must ﬁrst ﬁnd the predicted response for every x. Software or a graphing calculator gives you the residuals all at once. Here are the 21 residuals for the Gesell data, from software: residuals: 2.0310 −9.5721 −15.6040 −8.7309 9.0310 −0.3341 3.4120 2.5230 3.1421 6.6659 11.0151 −3.7309 −15.6040 −13.4770 4.5230 1.3960 8.6500 −5.5403 30.2850 −11.4770 1.3960 Because the residuals show how far the data fall from our regression line, examining the residuals helps assess how well the line describes the data. Al- though residuals can be calculated from any model ﬁtted to the data, the resid- uals from the least-squares line have a special property: the mean of the least- squares residuals is always zero. Compare the scatterplot in Figure 5.5 with the residual plot for the same data in Figure 5.6. The horizontal line at zero in Figure 5.6 helps orient us. It corresponds to the regression line in Figure 5.5. RESIDUAL PLOTS A residual plot is a scatterplot of the regression residuals against the explanatory variable. Residual plots help us assess the ﬁt of a regression line.

APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE 5.7 Does fast driving waste fuel? Exercise 4.6 (page 86) gives data on the fuel consumption y of a car at various speeds x. Fuel consumption is measured in liters of gasoline per 100 kilometers driven and speed is measured in kilometers per hour. Software tells us that the equation of the least-squares regression line is ˆy = 11.058 − 0.01466x The residuals, in the same order as the observations, are 10.09 2.24 −0.62 −2.47 −3.33 −4.28 −3.73 −2.94 −2.17 −1.32 −0.42 0.57 1.64 2.76 3.97 (a) Make a scatterplot of the observations and draw the regression line on your plot.

(d) Make a plot of the residuals against the values of x.Drawa horizontal line at height zero on your plot. Notice that the residuals show the same pattern about this line as the data points show about the regression line in the scatterplot in (a). Influential observations Figures 5.5 and 5.6 show two unusual observations. Children 18 and 19 are unusual in different ways. Child 19 lies far from the regression line. Child 18 is close to the line but far out in the x direction. Child 19 is an outlier in the y direction, with a Gesell score so high that we should check for a mistake in recording it. In fact, the score is correct. Child 18 is an outlier in the x direction. This child began to speak much later than any of the other children. Because of its extreme position on the age scale, this point has a strong inﬂuence on the position of the regression line. Figure 5.7 adds a second regression line, calculated after leaving out Child 18. You can see that this one point moves the line quite a bit. Least-squares lines make the sum of squares of the vertical distances to the points as small as possible. A point that is extreme in the x direction with no other points near it pulls the line toward itself. We call such points inﬂuential.

The solid line is calculated from all the data. The dashed line was calculated leaving out Child 18. Child 18 is an inﬂuential observation because leaving out this point moves the regression line quite a bit. OUTLIERS AND INFLUENTIAL OBSERVATIONS IN REGRESSION An outlier is an observation that lies outside the overall pattern of the other observations. Points that are outliers in the y direction of a scatterplot have large regression residuals, but other outliers need not have large residuals. An observation is influential for a statistical calculation if removing it would markedly change the result of the calculation. Points that are outliers in the x direction of a scatterplot are often inﬂuential for the least-squares regression line. We did not need the distinction between outliers and inﬂuential observa- tions in Chapter 2. A single large salary that pulls up the mean salary x for a group of workers is an outlier because it lies far above the other salaries. It is also inﬂuential, because the mean changes when it is removed. In the regression set- ting, however, not all outliers are inﬂuential. The least-squares regression line is most likely to be heavily inﬂuenced by observations that are outliers in the x direction. The scatterplot will alert you to observations that are extreme in x and may therefore be inﬂuential. The surest way to verify that a point is in- ﬂuential is to ﬁnd the regression line both with and without the suspect point, as in Figure 5.7. If the line moves more than a small amount when the point P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-05 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:52 118 CHAPTER 5 \u0001 Regression is deleted, the point is inﬂuential. The Correlation and Regression applet allows you to move points and watch how they inﬂuence the least-squares line.APPLET EXAMPLE 5.6 An influential observation The strong inﬂuence of Child 18 makes the original regression of Gesell score on age at ﬁrst word misleading. The original data have r 2 = 0.41. That is, the age at which a child begins to talk explains 41% of the variation on a later test of mental ability. This relationship is strong enough to be interesting to parents. If we leave out Child 18, r 2 drops to only 11%. The apparent strength of the association was largely due to a single inﬂuential observation. What should the child development researcher do? She must decide whether Child 18 was so slow to speak that this individual should not be allowed to inﬂu- ence the analysis. If she excludes Child 18, much of the evidence for a connection between the age at which a child begins to talk and later ability score vanishes. If she keeps Child 18, she needs data on other children who were also slow to begin talking, so that the analysis no longer depends so heavily on just one child. APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE 5.8 Influential or not? We have seen that Child 18 in the Gesell data in Table 5.1 (page 114) is an inﬂuential observation. Now we will examine the effect of Child 19, who is also an outlier in Figure 5.5. (a) Find the least-squares regression line of Gesell score on age at ﬁrst word, leaving out Child 19. Example 5.5 gives the regression line from all the children. Plot both lines on the same graph. (You do not have to make a scatterplot of all the points; just plot the two lines.) Would you call Child 19 very inﬂuential? Why? (b) For all children, r 2 = 0.41. How does removing Child 19 change the r 2 for this regression? Explain why r 2 changes in this direction when you drop Child 19. 5.9 Sports car gas mileage. The data on gas mileage of two-seater cars (Table 1.2, page 12) contain an outlier, the Honda Insight. When we predict highway mileage from city mileage, this point is an outlier in both the x and y directions. We wonder if it inﬂuences the least-squares line. (a) Make a scatterplot and draw (again) the least-squares line from all 22 car models. (b) Find the least-squares line when the Insight is left out of the calculation and draw this line on your plot. (c) Inﬂuence is a matter of degree, not a yes-or-no question. Use both regression lines to predict highway mileages for city mileages of 10, 20, and 25 MPG. (These city mileage values span the range of car models other than the Insight.) Do you think the Insight changes the predictions enough to be important to a car buyer?

When you use these tools, you must be aware of their limitations, beginning with the fact that correlation and regression describe only linear relationships. Also remember that the correlation r and the least- squares regression line are not resistant. One inﬂuential observation or incor- rectly entered data point can greatly change these measures. Always plot your data before interpreting regression or correlation. Here are some other cautions to keep in mind when you apply correlation and regression or read accounts of their use. Beware extrapolation. Suppose that you have data on a child’s growth be- tween 3 and 8 years of age. You ﬁnd a strong linear relationship between age x and height y. If you ﬁt a regression line to these data and use it to predict height at age 25 years, you will predict that the child will be 8 feet tall. Growth slows down and then stops at maturity, so extending the straight line to adult ages is foolish. Few relationships are linear for all values of x. So don’t stray far from the range of x that actually appears in your data. EXTRAPOLATION Extrapolation is the use of a regression line for prediction far outside the range of values of the explanatory variable x that you used to obtain the line. Such predictions are often not accurate. Beware the lurking variable. Correlation and regression describe the rela- tionship between two variables. Often the relationship between two variables is strongly inﬂuenced by other variables. More advanced statistical methods allow the study of many variables together, so that we can take other variables into account. Sometimes, however, the relationship between two variables is inﬂuenced by other variables that we did not measure or even think about. Because these variables are lurking in the background, we call them lurking variables. Do left-handers die early? Yes, said a study of 1000 deaths in California. Left-handed people died at an average age of 66 years; right-handers, at 75 years of age. Should left-handed people fear an early death? No—the lurking variable has struck again. Older people grew up in an era when many natural left-handers were forced to use their right hands. So right-handers are more common among older people, and left-handers are more common among the young. When we look at deaths, the left-handers who die are younger on the average because left-handers in general are younger. Mystery solved. LURKING VARIABLE A lurking variable is a variable that has an important effect on the relationship among the variables in a study but is not included among the variables studied. You should always think about possible lurking variables before you draw conclusions based on correlation or regression.

The Kalamazoo (Michigan) Symphony once advertised a “Mozart for Minors” pro- gram with this statement: “Question: Which students scored 51 points higher in verbal skills and 39 points higher in math? Answer: Students who had experience in music.” 4 We could as well answer “Children who played soccer.” Why? Children with pros- perous and well-educated parents are more likely than poorer children to have ex- perience with music and also to play soccer. They are also likely to attend good schools, get good health care, and be encouraged to study hard. These advantages lead to high test scores. Experience with music and soccer are correlated with high scores just because they go along with the other advantages of having prosperous and educated parents.

A College Board study of 15,941 high school graduates found a strong correlation between how much math minority students took in high school and their later success in college. News articles quoted the head of the College Board as saying that “math is the gatekeeper for success in college.”5 Maybe so, but we should also think about lurking variables. What might lead minority students to take more or fewer high school math courses? Would these same factors inﬂuence success in college? Association does not imply causation Thinking about lurking variables leads to the most important caution about correlation and regression. When we study the relationship between two vari- ables, we often hope to show that changes in the explanatory variable cause P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-05 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:52 121Association does not imply causation changes in the response variable. A strong association between two variables is not enough to draw conclusions about cause and effect. Sometimes an ob- served association really does reﬂect cause and effect. The Sanchez household uses more natural gas in colder months because cold weather requires burning more gas to stay warm. In other cases, an association is explained by lurking variables, and the conclusion that x causes y is either wrong or not proved. EXAMPLE 5.8 Does TV make you live longer? Measure the number of television sets per person x and the average life expectancy y for the world’s nations. There is a high positive correlation: nations with many TV sets have higher life expectancies. The basic meaning of causation is that by changing x we can bring about a change in y. Could we lengthen the lives of people in Rwanda by shipping them TV sets? No. Rich nations have more TV sets than poor nations. Rich nations also have longer life expectancies because they offer better nutrition, clean water, and better health care. There is no cause-and-effect tie between TV sets and length of life. Correlations such as that in Example 5.8 are sometimes called “nonsense correlations.” The correlation is real. What is nonsense is the conclusion that changing one of the variables causes changes in the other. A lurking variable— such as national wealth in Example 5.8—that inﬂuences both x and y can create a high correlation even though there is no direct connection between x and y. ASSOCIATION DOES NOT IMPLY CAUSATION An association between an explanatory variable x and a response variable y, even if it is very strong, is not by itself good evidence that changes in x actually cause changes in y. EXAMPLE 5.9 Obesity in mothers and daughters Obese parents tend to have obese children. The results of a study of Mexican American girls aged 9 to 12 years are typical. The investigators measured body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight relative to height, for both the girls and their mothers. People with high BMI are overweight or obese. The correlation between the BMI of daughters and the BMI of their mothers was r = 0.506.6 Body type is in part determined by heredity. Daughters inherit half their genes from their mothers. There is therefore a direct causal link between the BMI of moth- ers and daughters. But it may be that mothers who are overweight also set an example of little exercise, poor eating habits, and lots of television. Their daughters pick up these habits to some extent, so the inﬂuence of heredity is mixed up with inﬂuences from the girls’ environment. Both contribute to the mother-daughter correlation. The lesson of Example 5.9 is more subtle than just “association does not im- ply causation.” Even when direct causation is present, it may not be the whole P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-05 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:52 122 CHAPTER 5 \u0001 Regression explanation for a correlation. You must still worry about lurking variables. Careful statistical studies try to anticipate lurking variables and measure them so that they are no longer “lurking.” The mother-daughter study did measure TV viewing, exercise, and diet. Elaborate statistical analysis can remove the effects of these variables to come closer to the direct effect of mother’s BMI on daughter’s BMI. This remains a second-best approach to causation. The best way to get good evidence that x causes y is to do an experiment in which weexperiment change x and keep lurking variables under control. We will discuss experiments in Chapter 8. When experiments cannot be done, ﬁnding the explanation for an observed association is often difﬁcult and controversial. Many of the sharpest disputes in which statistics plays a role involve questions of causation that cannot be settled by experiment. Do gun control laws reduce violent crime? Does using cell phones cause brain tumors? Has increased free trade widened the gap be- tween the incomes of more educated and less educated American workers? All of these questions have become public issues. All concern associations among variables. And all have this in common: they try to pinpoint cause and effect in a setting involving complex relations among many interacting variables. EXAMPLE 5.10 Does smoking cause lung cancer? Despite the difﬁculties, it is sometimes possible to build a strong case for causation in the absence of experiments. The evidence that smoking causes lung cancer is about as strong as nonexperimental evidence can be. Doctors had long observed that most lung cancer patients were smokers. Compar- ison of smokers and “similar” nonsmokers showed a very strong association between smoking and death from lung cancer. Could the association be explained by lurking variables? Might there be, for example, a genetic factor that predisposes people both to nicotine addiction and to lung cancer? Smoking and lung cancer would then be positively associated even if smoking had no direct effect on the lungs. How were these objections overcome? Let’s answer this question in general terms: What are the criteria for estab- lishing causation when we cannot do an experiment? \u0001 The association is strong. The association between smoking and lung cancer is very strong. \u0001 The association is consistent. Many studies of different kinds of people in many countries link smoking to lung cancer. That reduces the chance that a lurking variable speciﬁc to one group or one study explains the association. \u0001 Higher doses are associated with stronger responses. People who smoke more cigarettes per day or who smoke over a longer period get lung cancer more often. People who stop smoking reduce their risk. \u0001 The alleged cause precedes the effect in time. Lung cancer develops after years of smoking. The number of men dying of lung cancer rose as smoking became more common, with a lag of about 30 years. Lung cancer P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-05 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:52 123Chapter 5 Summary kills more men than any other form of cancer. Lung cancer was rare among women until women began to smoke. Lung cancer in women rose along with smoking, again with a lag of about 30 years, and has now passed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among women. \u0001 The alleged cause is plausible. Experiments with animals show that tars from cigarette smoke do cause cancer. Medical authorities do not hesitate to say that smoking causes lung cancer. The U.S. Surgeon General has long stated that cigarette smoking is “the largest avoidable cause of death and disability in the United States.” 7 The evidence for causation is overwhelming—but it is not as strong as the evidence provided by well-designed experiments. APPLYYOURKNOWLEDGE 5.12 Education and income. There is a strong positive association between the education and income of adults. For example, the Census Bureau reports that the median income of people aged 25 and over increases from $15,800 for those with less than a ninth-grade education, to $24,656 for high school graduates, to $40,939 for holders of a bachelor’s degree, and on up for yet more education. In part, this association reﬂects causation—education helps people qualify for better jobs. Suggest several lurking variables (ask yourself what kinds of people tend to get good educations) that also contribute. 5.13 How’s your self-esteem? People who do well tend to feel good about themselves. Perhaps helping people feel good about themselves will help them do better in school and life. Raising self-esteem became for a time a goal in many schools. California even created a state commission to advance the cause. Can you think of explanations for the association between high self-esteem and good school performance other than “Self-esteem causes better work in school”? 5.14 Are big hospitals bad for you? A study shows that there is a positive correlation between the size of a hospital (measured by its number of beds x) and the median number of days y that patients remain in the hospital. Does this mean that you can shorten a hospital stay by choosing a small hospital? Why? Chapter 5 SUMMARY A regression line is a straight line that describes how a response variable y changes as an explanatory variable x changes. You can use a regression line to predict the value of y for any value of x by substituting this x into the equation of the line. The slope b of a regression line ˆy = a + bx is the rate at which the predicted response ˆy changes along the line as the explanatory variable x changes. Speciﬁcally, b is the change in ˆy when x increases by 1. P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-05 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:52 124 CHAPTER 5 \u0001 Regression The intercept a of a regression line ˆy = a + bx is the predicted response ˆy when the explanatory variable x = 0. This prediction is of no statistical use unless x can actually take values near 0. The most common method of ﬁtting a line to a scatterplot is least squares. The least-squares regression line is the straight line ˆy = a + bx that minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances of the observed points from the line. The least-squares regression line of y on x is the line with slope rs y/s x and intercept a = y − b x. This line always passes through the point (x, y). Correlation and regression are closely connected. The correlation r is the slope of the least-squares regression line when we measure both x and y in standardized units. The square of the correlation r 2 is the fraction of the variance of one variable that is explained by least-squares regression on the other variable. Correlation and regression must be interpreted with caution. Plot the data to be sure the relationship is roughly linear and to detect outliers and inﬂuential observations. A plot of the residuals makes these effects easier to see. Look for influential observations, individual points that substantially change the regression line. Inﬂuential observations are often outliers in the x direction. Avoid extrapolation, the use of a regression line for prediction for values of the explanatory variable far outside the range of the data from which the line was calculated. Lurking variables that you did not measure may explain the relations between the variables you did measure. Correlation and regression can be misleading if you ignore important lurking variables. Most of all, be careful not to conclude that there is a cause-and-effect rela- tionship between two variables just because they are strongly associated. High correlation does not imply causation. The best evidence that an association is due to causation comes from an experiment in which the explanatory variable is directly changed and other inﬂuences on the response are controlled. Chapter 5 EXERCISES 5.15 Sisters and brothers. How strongly do physical characteristics of sisters and brothers correlate? Here are data on the heights (in inches) of 11 adult pairs:8 Brother 71 68 66 67 70 71 70 73 72 65 66 Sister 69 64 65 63 65 62 65 64 66 59 62 (a) Verify using your calculator or software that the least-squares line for predicting sister’s height from brother’s height is ˆy =−6.356 P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-05 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:52 125Chapter 5 Exercises + 1.048x. What is the correlation between sister’s height and brother’s height? (b) Damien is 70 inches tall. Predict the height of his sister Tonya. (Superstock/Superstock/PictureQuest) 5.16 Husbands and wives. The mean height of American women in their twenties is about 64 inches, and the standard deviation is about 2.7 inches. The mean height of men the same age is about 69.3 inches, with standard deviation about 2.8 inches. If the correlation between the heights of husbands and wives is about r = 0.5, what is the slope of the regression line of the husband’s height on the wife’s height in young couples? Draw a graph of this regression line. Predict the height of the husband of a woman who is 67 inches tall. 5.17 Measuring water quality. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) measures organic pollutants in water by measuring the amount of oxygen consumed by microorganisms that break down these compounds. BOD is hard to measure accurately. Total organic carbon (TOC) is easy to measure, so it is common to measure TOC and use regression to predict BOD. A typical regression equation for water entering a municipal treatment plant is9 BOD =−55.43 + 1.507 TOC Both BOD and TOC are measured in milligrams per liter of water. (a) What does the slope of this line say about the relationship between BOD and TOC? (b) What is the predicted BOD when TOC = 0? Values of BOD less than 0 are impossible. Why does the prediction give an impossible value? 5.18 IQ and school GPA. Figure 4.6 (page 95) plots school grade point average (GPA) against IQ test score for 78 seventh-grade students. Calculation shows that the mean and standard deviation of the IQ scores are x = 108.9 s x = 13.17 For the grade point averages, y = 7.447 s y = 2.10 The correlation between IQ and GPA is r = 0.6337. (a) Find the equation of the least-squares line for predicting GPA from IQ. (b) What percent of the observed variation in these students’ GPAs can be explained by the linear relationship between GPA and IQ? (c) One student has an IQ of 103 but a very low GPA of 0.53. What is the predicted GPA for a student with IQ = 103? What is the residual for this particular student?

Sarah’s parents are concerned that she seems short for her age. Their doctor has the following record of Sarah’s height: Age (months) 36 48 51 54 57 60 Height (cm) 86 90 91 93 94 95 (a) Make a scatterplot of these data. Note the strong linear pattern. (b) Using your calculator, ﬁnd the equation of the least-squares regression line of height on age. (c) Predict Sarah’s height at 40 months and at 60 months. Use your results to draw the regression line on your scatterplot. (d) What is Sarah’s rate of growth, in centimeters per month? Normally growing girls gain about 6 cm in height between ages 4 (48 months) and 5 (60 months). What rate of growth is this in centimeters per month? Is Sarah growing more slowly than normal? 5.20 Heating a home. Exercise 4.16 (page 96) gives data on degree-days and natural gas consumed by the Sanchez home for 16 consecutive months. There is a very strong linear relationship. Mr. Sanchez asks, “If a month averages 20 degree-days per day (that’s 45◦ F), how much gas will we use?” Use your calculator or software to ﬁnd the least-squares regression line and answer his question. 5.21 A nonsense prediction. Use the least-squares regression line for the data in Exercise 5.19 to predict Sarah’s height at age 40 years (480 months). Your prediction is in centimeters. Convert it to inches using the fact that a centimeter is 0.3937 inch. The data have r 2 almost 0.99. Why is the prediction clearly silly? 5.22 Merlins breeding. Exercise 4.20 (page 97) gives data on the number of breeding pairs of merlins in an isolated area in each of nine years and the percent of males who returned the next year. The data show that the percent returning is lower after successful breeding seasons and that the relationship is roughly linear. Use your calculator or software to ﬁnd the least-squares regression line and predict the percent of returning males after a season with 30 breeding pairs. 5.23 Keeping water clean. Keeping water supplies clean requires regular measurement of levels of pollutants. The measurements are indirect—a typical analysis involves forming a dye by a chemical reaction with the dissolved pollutant, then passing light through the solution and measuring its “absorbence.” To calibrate such measurements, the laboratory measures known standard solutions and uses regression to relate absorbence to pollutant concentration. This is usually done every day. Here is one series of data on the absorbence for different levels of nitrates. Nitrates are measured in milligrams per liter of water.10 P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-05 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:52 127Chapter 5 Exercises Nitrates 50 50 100 200 400 800 1200 1600 2000 2000 Absorbence 7.0 7.5 12.8 24.0 47.0 93.0 138.0 183.0 230.0 226.0 (a) Chemical theory says that these data should lie on a straight line. If the correlation is not at least 0.997, something went wrong and the calibration procedure is repeated. Plot the data and ﬁnd the correlation. Must the calibration be done again? (b) What is the equation of the least-squares line for predicting absorbence from concentration? If the lab analyzed a specimen with 500 milligrams of nitrates per liter, what do you expect the absorbence to be? Based on your plot and the correlation, do you expect your predicted absorbence to be very accurate? 5.24 Comparing regressions. What are the correlations between the explanatory and response variables in Exercises 5.20 and 5.22? What does r 2 say about the two regressions? Which of the two predictions do you expect to be more accurate? Explain why. (Digital Vision/Getty Images) 5.25 Is wine good for your heart? Table 4.3 (page 101) gives data on wine consumption and heart disease death rates in 19 countries. A scatterplot (Exercise 4.27) shows a moderately strong relationship. (a) The correlation for these variables is r =−0.843. What does a negative correlation say about wine consumption and heart disease deaths? About what percent of the variation among countries in heart disease death rates is explained by the straight-line relationship with wine consumption? (b) The least-squares regression line for predicting heart disease death rate from wine consumption is ˆy = 260.56 − 22.969x Use this equation to predict the heart disease death rate in another country where adults average 4 liters of alcohol from wine each year. (c) The correlation in (a) and the slope of the least-squares line in (b) are both negative. Is it possible for these two quantities to have opposite signs? Explain your answer. 5.26 Always plot your data! Table 5.2 presents four sets of data prepared by the statistician Frank Anscombe to illustrate the dangers of calculating without ﬁrst plotting the data. 11 (a) Without making scatterplots, ﬁnd the correlation and the least-squares regression line for all four data sets. What do you notice? Use the regression line to predict y for x = 10. (b) Make a scatterplot for each of the data sets and add the regression line to each plot.

Explain your answer in each case. 5.27 Lots of wine. Exercise 5.25 gives the least-squares line for predicting a nation’s heart disease death rate from its wine consumption. What is the predicted heart disease death rate for a country that drinks enough wine to supply 150 liters of alcohol per person? Explain why this result can’t be true. Explain why using the regression line for this prediction is not intelligent. 5.28 What’s my grade? In Professor Friedman’s economics course the correlation between the students’ total scores prior to the ﬁnal examination and their ﬁnal examination scores is r = 0.6. The pre-exam totals for all students in the course have mean 280 and standard deviation 30. The ﬁnal exam scores have mean 75 and standard deviation 8. Professor Friedman has lost Julie’s ﬁnal exam but knows that her total before the exam was 300. He decides to predict her ﬁnal exam score from her pre-exam total. (a) What is the slope of the least-squares regression line of ﬁnal exam scores on pre-exam total scores in this course? What is the intercept?

(c) Julie doesn’t think this method accurately predicts how well she did on the ﬁnal exam. Use r 2 to argue that her actual score could have been much higher (or much lower) than the predicted value. 5.29 Going to class. A study of class attendance and grades among ﬁrst-year students at a state university showed that in general students who attended a higher percent of their classes earned higher grades. Class attendance explained 16% of the variation in grade index among the students. What is the numerical value of the correlation between percent of classes attended and grade index? 5.30 Will I bomb the final? We expect that students who do well on the midterm exam in a course will usually also do well on the ﬁnal exam. Gary Smith of Pomona College looked at the exam scores of all 346 students who took his statistics class over a 10-year period. 12 The least-squares line for predicting ﬁnal exam score from midterm exam score was ˆy = 46.6 + 0.41x. Octavio scores 10 points above the class mean on the midterm. How many points above the class mean do you predict that he will score on the ﬁnal? (Hint: Use the fact that the least-squares line passes through the point (x, y) and the fact that Octavio’s midterm score is x + 10. This is an example of the phenomenon that gave “regression” its name: students who do well on the midterm will on the average do less well, but still above average, on the ﬁnal.) 5.31 Height and reading score. A study of elementary school children, ages 6 to 11, ﬁnds a high positive correlation between height x and score y on a test of reading comprehension. What explains this correlation? 5.32 Do artificial sweeteners cause weight gain? People who use artiﬁcial sweeteners in place of sugar tend to be heavier than people who use sugar. Does this mean that artiﬁcial sweeteners cause weight gain? Give a more plausible explanation for this association. 5.33 What explains grade inflation? Students at almost all colleges and universities get higher grades than was the case 10 or 20 years ago. Is grade inﬂation caused by lower grading standards? Suggest some lurking variables that might affect the distribution of grades even if standards have remained the same. 5.34 The benefits of foreign language study. Members of a high school language club believe that study of a foreign language improves a student’s command of English. From school records, they obtain the scores on an English achievement test given to all seniors. The mean score of seniors who studied a foreign language for at least two years is much higher than the mean score of seniors who studied no foreign language. These data are not good evidence that language study strengthens English skills. Identify the explanatory and response P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-05 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:52 130 CHAPTER 5 \u0001 Regression variables in this study. Then explain what lurking variable prevents the conclusion that language study improves students’ English scores. 5.35 Beware correlations based on averages. The variables used for regression and correlation are sometimes averages of a number of individual values. For example, both degree-days and gas consumption for the Sanchez household (Exercise 4.16) are averages over the days of a month. The values for individual days vary about the monthly average. If you calculated the correlation for the 485 days in these 16 months, would r be closer to 1 or closer to 0 than the r for the 16 monthly averages? Why? (Daniel J. Cox/Natural Exposures) 5.36 Beavers and beetles. Ecologists sometimes ﬁnd rather strange relationships in our environment. One study seems to show that beavers beneﬁt beetles. The researchers laid out 23 circular plots, each 4 meters in diameter, in an area where beavers were cutting down cottonwood trees. In each plot, they counted the number of stumps from trees cut by beavers and the number of clusters of beetle larvae. Here are the data:13 Stumps 221334312513 Beetle larvae 10 30 12 24 36 40 43 11 27 56 18 40 Stumps 21221141214 Beetle larvae 25 8211416 6 54 9131450 (a) Make a scatterplot that shows how the number of beaver-caused stumps inﬂuences the number of beetle larvae clusters. What does your plot show? (Ecologists think that the new sprouts from stumps are more tender than other cottonwood growth, so that beetles prefer them.) (b) Find the least-squares regression line and draw it on your plot. (c) What percent of the observed variation in beetle larvae counts can be explained by straight-line dependence on stump counts? 5.37 A computer game. A multimedia statistics learning system includes a test of skill in using the computer’s mouse. The software displays a circle at a random location on the computer screen. The subject tries to click in the circle with the mouse as quickly as possible. A new circle appears as soon as the subject clicks the old one. Table 5.3 gives data for one subject’s trials, 20 with each hand. Distance is the distance from the cursor location to the center of the new circle, in units whose actual size depends on the size of the screen. Time is the time required to click in the new circle, in milliseconds.14 (a) We suspect that time depends on distance. Make a scatterplot of time against distance, using separate symbols for each hand. (b) Describe the pattern. How can you tell that the subject is right-handed?

Draw these lines on your plot. Which regression does a better job of predicting time from distance? Give numerical measures that describe the success of the two regressions. 5.38 Using residuals. It is possible that the subject in Exercise 5.37 got better in later trials due to learning. It is also possible that he got worse due to fatigue. Plot the residuals from each regression against the time order of the trials (down the columns in Table 5.3). Is either of these systematic effects of time visible in the data? 5.39 How residuals behave. Return to the merlin data regression of Exercise 5.22. Use your calculator or software to obtain the residuals. The residuals are the part of the response left over after the straight-line tie to the explanatory variable is removed. Find the correlation between the residuals and the explanatory variable. Your result should not be a surprise. 5.40 Using residuals. Make a residual plot (residual against explanatory variable) for the merlin regression of Exercise 5.22. Use a y scale from −20 to 20 or wider to better see the pattern. Add a horizontal line at y = 0, the mean of the residuals. (a) Describe the pattern if we ignore the two years with x = 38. Do the x = 38 years ﬁt this pattern?

Make a scatterplot with two least-squares lines: with all nine years and without the two x = 38 years. Although the original regression in Exercise 5.22 seemed satisfactory, the two x = 38 years are inﬂuential. We would like more data for years with x greater than 33. 5.41 Using residuals. Return to the regression of highway mileage on city mileage in Exercise 5.3 (page 109). Use your calculator or software to obtain the residuals. Make a residual plot (residuals against city mileage) and add a horizontal line at y = 0 (the mean of the residuals). (a) Which car has the largest positive residual? The largest negative residual? (b) The Honda Insight, an extreme outlier, does not have the largest residual in either direction. Why is this not surprising? (c) Explain brieﬂy what a large positive residual says about a car. What does a large negative residual say? Chapter 5 MEDIA EXERCISES 5.42 Influence in regression. The Correlation and Regression applet allows you to create a scatterplot and to move points by dragging with the mouse. Click to create a group of 10 points in the lower-left corner of the scatterplot with a strong straight-line pattern (correlation about 0.9). Click the “Show least-squares line” box to display the regression line. APPLET (a) Add one point at the upper right that is far from the other 10 points but exactly on the regression line. Why does this outlier have no effect on the line even though it changes the correlation? (b) Now drag this last point down until it is opposite the group of 10 points. You see that one end of the least-squares line chases this single point, while the other end remains near the middle of the original group of 10. What makes the last point so inﬂuential? APPLET APPLET 5.43 Is regression useful? In Exercise 4.32 (page 102) you used the Correlation and Regression applet to create three scatterplots having correlation about r = 0.7 between the horizontal variable x and the vertical variable y. Create three similar scatterplots again, and click the “Show least-squares line” box to display the regression lines. Correlation r = 0.7 is considered reasonably strong in many areas of work. Because there is a reasonably strong correlation, we might use a regression line to predict y from x. In which of your three scatterplots does it make sense to use a straight line for prediction? 5.44 Guessing a regression line. Click on the scatterplot to create a group of 15 to 20 points from lower left to upper right with a clear positive straight-line pattern (correlation around 0.7). Click the “Draw line” button and use the mouse (right-click and drag) to draw a line through P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-05 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:52 133Chapter 5 Media Exercises the middle of the cloud of points from lower left to upper right. Note the “thermometer” above the plot. The red portion is the sum of the squared vertical distances from the points in the plot to the least-squares line. The green portion is the “extra” sum of squares for your line—it shows by how much your line misses the smallest possible sum of squares. (a) You drew a line by eye through the middle of the pattern. Yet the right-hand part of the bar is probably almost entirely green. What doesthattellyou? (b) Now click the “Show least-squares line” box. Is the slope of the least-squares line smaller (the new line is less steep) or larger (line is steeper) than that of your line? If you repeat this exercise several times, you will consistently get the same result. The least-squares line minimizes the vertical distances of the points from the line. It is not the line through the “middle” of the cloud of points. This is one reason why it is hard to draw a good regression line by eye. EESEE 5.45 An influenza epidemic. In 1918 and 1919 a worldwide outbreak of inﬂuenza killed more than 25 million people. The EESEE story “Inﬂuenza Outbreak of 1918” includes the following data on the number of new inﬂuenza cases and the number of deaths from the epidemic in San Francisco week by week from October 5, 1918, to January 25, 1919.

Describe and compare the patterns you see. (b) Find the correlations that go with your three plots. (c) What do you conclude? Do the cases data predict deaths best with no lag, a one-week lag, or a two-week lag?

Marginal distributions Relationships between categorical variables Conditional distributions Simpson's paradox We have concentrated on relationships in which at least the response vari- able is quantitative. Now we will shift to describing relationships between two or more categorical variables. Some variables—such as gender, race, and occupation—are categorical by nature. Other categorical variables are created by grouping values of a quantitative variable into classes. Published data often appear in grouped form to save space. To analyze categorical data, we use the counts or percents of individuals that fall into various categories. EXAMPLE 6.1 Age and education Table 6.1 presents Census Bureau data for the year 2000 on the level of education reached by Americans of different ages.1 Many people under 25 years of age have not completed their education, so they are left out of the table. Both variables, age and education, are grouped into categories. This is a two-way table because it describestwo-way table two categorical variables. Education is the row variable because each row in the tablerow and column variables describes people with one level of education. Age is the column variable because each column describes one age group. The entries in the table are the counts of persons in each age-by-education class. Although both age and education in this table are categorical variables, both have a natural order from least to most. The order of the rows and the columns in Table 6.1 reﬂects the order of the categories. ∗This material is important in statistics, but it is needed later in this book only for Chapter 20. You may omit it if you do not plan to read Chapter 20 or delay reading it until you reach Chapter 20. 134 P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-06 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:57 135Marginal distributions TABLE 6.1 Years of school completed, by age (thousands of persons) Age group Education 25 to 34 35 to 54 55 and over Total Did not complete high school 4,459 9,174 14,226 27,859 Completed high school 11,562 26,455 20,060 58,077 College, 1 to 3 years 10,693 22,647 11,125 44,465 College, 4 or more years 11,071 23,160 10,597 44,828 Total 37,786 81,435 56,008 175,230 Marginal distributions How can we best grasp the information contained in Table 6.1? First, look at the distribution of each variable separately. The distribution of a categorical variable says how often each outcome occurred. The “Total” column at the right of the table contains the totals for each of the rows. These row totals give the distribution of education level (the row variable) among all people 25 years of age and older: 27,859,000 did not complete high school, 58,077,000 ﬁnished high school but did not attend college, and so on. In the same way, the “Total” row at the bottom of the table gives the age distribution. If the row and column totals are missing, the ﬁrst thing to do in studying a two-way table is to calculate them. The distributions of education alone and age alone are called marginal marginal distribution distributions because they appear at the right and bottom margins of the two- way table. If you check the row and column totals in Table 6.1, you will notice some discrepancies. For example, the sum of the entries in the “25 to 34” column is 37,785. The entry in the “Total” row for that column is 37,786. The explana- tion is roundoff error. The table entries are in thousands of persons, and each roundoff error is rounded to the nearest thousand. The Census Bureau obtained the “Total” entry by rounding the exact number of people aged 25 to 34 to the nearest thousand. The result was 37,786,000. Adding the row entries, each of which is already rounded, gives a slightly different result. Percents are often more informative than counts. We can display the marginal distribution of education level in terms of percents by dividing each row total by the table total and converting to a percent. EXAMPLE 6.2 Calculating a marginal distribution The percent of people 25 years of age and older who have at least 4 years of college is total with 4 years of college table total = 44,828 175,230 = 0.256 = 25.6% P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-06 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:57 136 CHAPTER 6 \u0001 Two-Way Tables Do three more such calculations to obtain the marginal distribution of education level in percents. Here it is: Did not complete Completed 1 to 3 years ≥4years high school high school of college of college Percent 15.9 33.1 25.4 25.6 The total is 100% because everyone is in one of the four education categories. Each marginal distribution from a two-way table is a distribution for a single categorical variable. As we saw in Chapter 1 (page 8), we can use a bar graph or a pie chart to display such a distribution. Figure 6.1 is a bar graph of the distribution of years of schooling. We see that people with at least some college education make up about half of the 25 and over population. In working with two-way tables, you must calculate lots of percents. Here’s a tip to help decide what fraction gives the percent you want. Ask, “What group represents the total that I want a percent of?” The count for that group is the denominator of the fraction that leads to the percent. In Example 6.2, we wanted a percent “of people aged 25 years and over,” so the count of people aged 25 and over (the table total) is the denominator.010203040Percent of adults Not HS grad HS grad Some college College grad Level of education 33.1% of all people age 25 and over have a high school diploma but no higher education Figure 6.1 A bar graph of the distribution of years of schooling completed among people aged 25 years and over. This is one of the marginal distributions for Table 6.1.

The counts in the “Total” column at the right of Table 6.1 are the counts of people in each education group. Explain why the sum of these counts is not exactly equal to 175,230, the table total that appears at the lower-right corner of the table. 6.2 Age and education. Give the marginal distribution of age (in percents) among people 25 years of age and older, starting from the counts in Table 6.1. 6.3 Risks of playing soccer. A study in Sweden looked at former elite soccer players, people who had played soccer but not at the elite level, and people of the same age who did not play soccer. Here is a two-way table that classiﬁes these subjects by whether or not they had arthritis of the hip or knee by their mid-50s: 2 Elite Non-elite Did not play Arthritis 10 9 24 No arthritis 61 206 548 (a) How many people do these data describe? (b) How many of these people have arthritis of the hip or knee? (c) Give the marginal distribution of participation in soccer, both as counts and as percents. Relationships between categorical variables Table 6.1 contains much more information than the two marginal distributions of age alone and education alone. The nature of the relationship between age and education cannot be deduced from the separate distributions but requires the full table. Relationships between categorical variables are described by calculating appropriate percents from the counts given. We use percents be- cause counts are often hard to compare. For example, 23,160,000 persons aged 35 to 54 have completed college, and only 10,597,000 persons in the 55-and-up age group have done so. These counts do not accurately describe the associa- tion, however, because there are many more people in the younger age group. EXAMPLE 6.3 How common is college education? What percent of people aged 25 to 34 have completed 4 years of college? This is the count of those who are 25 to 34 and have 4 years of college as a percent of the age group total: 11,071 37,786 = 0.293 = 29.3% P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-06 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:57 138 CHAPTER 6 \u0001 Two-Way Tables “People aged 25 to 34” is the group we want a percent of, so the count for that group is the denominator. In the same way, ﬁnd the percent of people in each age group who have completed college. The comparison of all three groups is 25 to 34 35 to 54 55 and over Percent with 4 years of college 29.3 28.4 18.9 These percentages make it clear that a college education is less common among Americans over age 55 than among younger adults. This is an important aspect of the association between age and education. These percents do not add to 100% because they are not the parts of a whole. They describe three different age groups. APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE 6.4 Age and education. Using the counts in Table 6.1, ﬁnd the percent of people in each age group who did not complete high school. Draw a bar graph that compares these percents. State brieﬂy what the data show. 6.5 Risks of playing soccer. Find the percent of each group in the soccer-risk data of Exercise 6.3 who have arthritis. What do these percents say about the association between playing soccer and later arthritis? Conditional distributions Example 6.3 does not compare the complete distributions of years of schooling in the three age groups. It compares only the percents who ﬁnished college. Let’s look at the complete picture. EXAMPLE 6.4 Calculating a conditional distribution Information about the 25 to 34 age group occupies the ﬁrst column in Table 6.1. To ﬁnd the complete distribution of education in this age group, look only at that column. Compute each count as a percent of the column total, which is 37,786. Here is the distribution: Did not complete Completed 1 to 3 years ≥4 years high school high school of college of college Percent 11.8 30.6 28.3 29.3 These percents do add to 100% because all 25- to 34-year-olds fall in one of the edu- cational categories. The four percents together are the conditional distribution ofconditional distribution education, given that a person is 25 to 34 years of age. We use the term “conditional” because the distribution refers only to people who satisfy the condition that they are 25 to 34 years old.

The percents in each column add to 100%. Now focus in turn on the second column (people aged 35 to 54) and then the third column (people 55 and over) of Table 6.1 in order to ﬁnd two more conditional distributions. Statistical software can speed the task of ﬁnding each entry in a two-way table as a percent of its column total. Figure 6.2 displays the result. The software found the row and column totals from the table entries, so they differ slightly from those in Table 6.1. The software produces a legend at the bottom to remind us that the entries for each cell are the count and the count as a percent of its column total. Each cell in this table contains a count from Table 6.1 along with that count as a percent of the column total. The percents in each column form the con- ditional distribution of years of schooling for one age group. The percents in each column add to 100% because everyone in the age group is accounted for. Comparing the conditional distributions reveals the nature of the association between age and education. The distributions of education in the two younger groups are quite similar, but higher education is less common in the 55-and- over group. Bar graphs can help make the association visible. We could make three side- by-side bar graphs, each resembling Figure 6.1, to present the three conditional distributions. Figure 6.3 shows an alternative form of bar graph. Each set of three bars compares the percents in the three age groups who have reached a speciﬁc educational level. We see at once that the “25 to 34” and “35 to 54” bars are similar for all four levels of education, and that the “55 and over” bars show that many more people in this group did not ﬁnish high school and that many fewer have any college. No single graph (such as a scatterplot) portrays the form of the relation- ship between categorical variables. No single numerical measure (such as the correlation) summarizes the strength of the association. Bar graphs are ﬂexible enough to be helpful, but you must think about what comparisons you want P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-06 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:57 140 CHAPTER 6 \u0001 Two-Way Tables403020100403020100403020100403020100Percent who did not complete high schoolPercent with 1 to 3 years of college 25 to 34 35 to 54 55 and over 25 to 34 35 to 54 55 and over Age group 25 to 34 35 to 54 55 and over Age group Age group 25 to 34 35 to 54 55 and over Age groupPercent of college graduatesPercent of high school graduates Figure 6.3 Bar graphs to compare the education levels of three age groups.

You must decide which percents you need. Here is a hint: compare the conditional dis- tributions of the response variable (education) for the separate values of the explanatory variable (age). That’s what we did in Figure 6.3. APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE 6.6 Education among older people. Show the calculations to ﬁnd the conditional distribution of education among persons 55 years old and over.

A study of the career plans of young women and men sent questionnaires to all 722 members of the senior class in the College of Business Administration at the University of Illinois. One question asked which major within the business program the student had chosen. Here are the data from the students who responded:3 P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-06 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:57 141Simpson’s paradox Female Male Accounting 68 56 Administration 91 40 Economics 56 Finance 61 59 (a) Find the two conditional distributions of major, one for women and one for men.

Here are the row and column totals for a two-way table with two rows and two columns: ab 50 cd 50 60 40 100 Find two different sets of counts a , b, c, and d for the body of the table that give these same totals. This shows that the relationship between two variables cannot be obtained from the two individual distributions of the variables. Attack of the killer TVs! Despite occasional media frenzy, you won’t ﬁnd shark attacks high in any count of causes of death and injury. In fact, the 28 children killed by falling TV sets in the United States between 1990 and 1997 is four times the total number of people killed by great white sharks in the twentieth century. Simpson's paradox As is the case with quantitative variables, the effects of lurking variables can change or even reverse relationships between two categorical variables. Here is an example that demonstrates the surprises that can await the unsuspecting user of data. EXAMPLE 6.5 Do medical helicopters save lives? Accident victims are sometimes taken by helicopter from the accident scene to a hospital. The helicopter may save time and also brings medical care to the accident scene. Does the use of helicopters save lives? We might compare the percents of accident victims who die with helicopter evacuation and with the usual transport to a hospital by road. Here are hypothetical data that illustrate a practical difﬁculty:4 Helicopter Road Victim died 64 260 Victim survived 136 840 Total 200 1100 P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-06 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:57 142 CHAPTER 6 \u0001 Two-Way Tables We see that 32% (64 out of 200) helicopter patients died, compared with only 24% (260 out of 1100) of the others. That seems discouraging. The explanation is that the helicopter is sent mostly to serious accidents, so that the victims transported by helicopter are more often seriously injured than other victims. They are more likely to die with or without helicopter evacuation. Here are the same data broken down by the seriousness of the accident: Serious Accidents Helicopter Road Died 48 60 Survived 52 40 Total 100 100 Less Serious Accidents Helicopter Road Died 16 200 Survived 84 800 Total 100 1000 Inspect these tables to convince yourself that they describe the same 1300 accidents as the original two-way table. For example, 200 were moved by helicopter, and 64 (48 + 16) of these died. Among victims of serious accidents, the helicopter saves 52% (52 out of 100) compared with 40% for road transport. If we look only at less serious accidents, 84% of those transported by helicopter survive, versus 80% of those transported by road. Both groups of victims have a higher survival rate when evacuated by helicopter. (Ashley/Cooper/PICIMPACT/CORBIS) At ﬁrst, it seems paradoxical that the helicopter does better for both groups of victims but worse when all victims are lumped together. Examining the data makes the explanation clear. Half the helicopter transport patients are from serious accidents, compared with only 100 of the 1100 road transport patients. So the helicopter carries patients who are more likely to die. The seriousness of the accident was a lurking variable that, until we uncovered it, made the rela- tionship between survival and mode of transport to a hospital hard to interpret. Example 6.5 illustrates Simpson’s paradox. SIMPSON’S PARADOX An association or comparison that holds for all of several groups can reverse direction when the data are combined to form a single group. This reversal is called Simpson’s paradox. The lurking variable in Simpson’s paradox is categorical. That is, it breaks the individuals into groups, as when accident victims are classiﬁed as injured in a “serious accident” or a “less serious accident.” Simpson’s paradox is just an extreme form of the fact that observed associations can be misleading when there are lurking variables.

Here are the numbers of ﬂights on time and delayed for two airlines at ﬁve airports in one month. Overall on-time percentages for each airline are often reported in the news. The airport that ﬂights serve is a lurking variable that can make such reports misleading.5 Alaska Airlines America West On time Delayed On time Delayed Los Angeles 497 62 694 117 Phoenix 221 12 4840 415 San Diego 212 20 383 65 San Francisco 503 102 320 129 Seattle 1841 305 201 61 (a) What percent of all Alaska Airlines ﬂights were delayed?

Do the same for America West. (c) America West does worse at every one of the ﬁve airports, yet does better overall. That sounds impossible. Explain carefully, referring to the data, how this can happen. (The weather in Phoenix and Seattle lies behind this example of Simpson’s paradox.) 6.10 Race and the death penalty. Whether a convicted murderer gets the death penalty seems to be inﬂuenced by the race of the victim.

(b) Show that Simpson’s paradox holds: a higher percent of white defendants are sentenced to death overall, but for both black and white victims a higher percent of black defendants are sentenced to death.

Chapter 6 SUMMARY A two-way table of counts organizes data about two categorical variables. Values of the row variable label the rows that run across the table, and values of the column variable label the columns that run down the table. Two-way tables are often used to summarize large amounts of information by grouping outcomes into categories. The row totals and column totals in a two-way table give the marginal distributions of the two individual variables. It is clearer to present these distributions as percents of the table total. Marginal distributions tell us nothing about the relationship between the variables. To ﬁnd the conditional distribution of the row variable for one speciﬁc value of the column variable, look only at that one column in the table. Find each entry in the column as a percent of the column total. There is a conditional distribution of the row variable for each column in the table. Comparing these conditional distributions is one way to describe the association between the row and the column variables. It is particularly useful when the column variable is the explanatory variable. Bar graphs are a ﬂexible means of presenting categorical data. There is no single best way to describe an association between two categorical variables. A comparison between two variables that holds for each individual value of a third variable can be changed or even reversed when the data for all values of the third variable are combined. This is Simpson’s paradox. Simpson’s paradox is an example of the effect of lurking variables on an observed association. Chapter 6 EXERCISES Marital status and job level. We sometimes hear that getting married is good for your career. Table 6.2 presents data from one of the studies behind this generalization.

The data describe the marital status and the job level of all 8235 male managers and professionals employed by a large manufacturing firm. 7 The firm assigns each position a grade that reflects the value of that particular job to the company. The authors of the study grouped the many job grades into quarters. Grade 1 contains jobs in the lowest quarter of the job grades, and Grade 4 contains those in the highest quarter. Exercises 6.11 to 6.15 are based on these data. 6.11 Marginal distributions. Give (in percents) the two marginal distributions, for marital status and for job grade. Do each of your two sets of percents add to exactly 100%? If not, why not? 6.12 Percents. What percent of single men hold Grade 1 jobs? What percent of Grade 1 jobs are held by single men? 6.13 Conditional distribution. Give (in percents) the conditional distribution of job grade among single men. Should your percents add to 100% (up to roundoff error)? 6.14 Marital status and job grade. One way to see the relationship is to look at who holds Grade 1 jobs. (a) There are 874 married men with Grade 1 jobs, and only 58 single men with such jobs. Explain why these counts by themselves don’t describe the relationship between marital status and job grade. (b) Find the percent of men in each marital status group who have Grade 1 jobs. Then ﬁnd the percent in each marital group who have Grade 4 jobs. What do these percents say about the relationship? 6.15 Association is not causation. The data in Table 6.2 show that single men are more likely to hold lower-grade jobs than are married men. We should not conclude that single men can help their career by getting married. What lurking variables might help explain the association between marital status and job grade? 6.16 Smoking by students and their parents.

Firearms are second to motor vehicles as a cause of nondisease deaths in the United States. Here are counts from a study of all ﬁrearm-related deaths in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, between 1990 and 1994. 10 We want to compare the types of ﬁrearms used in homicides and in suicides. We suspect that long guns (shotguns and riﬂes) will more often be used in suicides because many people keep them at home for hunting. Make a careful comparison of homicides and suicides with a bar graph. What do you ﬁnd about long guns versus handguns?

Addicts need cocaine to feel any pleasure, so perhaps giving them an antidepressant drug will help. A 3-year study with 72 chronic cocaine users compared an antidepressant drug called desipramine with lithium and a placebo. (Lithium is a standard drug to treat cocaine addiction. A placebo is a dummy drug, used so that the effect of being in the study but not taking any drug can be seen.) One-third of the subjects, chosen at random, received each drug.

Purdue University is a Big Ten university that emphasizes engineering, scientiﬁc, and technical ﬁelds. University faculty start as assistant professors, then are promoted to associate professor and eventually to professor. Here is a two-way table that breaks down Purdue’s 1621 faculty members in the 1998–1999 academic year by gender and academic rank: Female Male Total Assistant professors 126 213 339 Associate professors 149 411 560 Professors 60 662 722 Total 335 1286 1621 (a) Describe the relationship between rank and gender by ﬁnding and commenting on several percents. (b) One possible explanation for the association might be discrimination (women ﬁnd it harder to win promotion to higher ranks). Suggest other possible explanations. (Henryk Kaiser/eStock Photography/PictureQuest) 6.21 Do angry people have more heart disease? People who get angry easily tend to have more heart disease. That’s the conclusion of a study that followed a random sample of 12,986 people from three locations for about four years. All subjects were free of heart disease at the beginning of the study. The subjects took the Spielberger Trait Anger Scale test, which measures how prone a person is to sudden anger. Here are data for the 8474 people in the sample who had normal blood pressure. 12 CHD stands for “coronary heart disease.” This includes people who had heart attacks and those who needed medical treatment for heart disease. Low anger Moderate anger High anger Total CHD 53 110 27 190 No CHD 3057 4621 606 8284 Total 3110 4731 633 8474 Present evidence from this two-way table that backs up the study’s conclusion about the relationship between anger and heart disease.

To help consumers make informed decisions about health care, the government releases data about patient outcomes in hospitals. You want to compare Hospital A and Hospital B, which serve your community. Here are data on all patients undergoing surgery in a recent time period. The data include the condition of the patient (“good” or “poor”) before the surgery. “Survived” means that the patient lived at least 6 weeks following surgery. Good Condition Hospital A Hospital B Died 68 Survived 594 592 Total 600 600 Poor Condition Hospital A Hospital B Died 57 8 Survived 1443 192 Total 1500 200 (a) Compare percents to show that Hospital A has a higher survival rate for both groups of patients. (b) Combine the data into a single two-way table of outcome (“survived” or “died”) by hospital (A or B). The local paper reports just these overall survival rates. Which hospital has the higher rate? (c) Explain from the data, in language that a reporter can understand, how Hospital B can do better overall even though Hospital A does better for both groups of patients. 6.23 Discrimination? Wabash Tech has two professional schools, business and law. Here are two-way tables of applicants to both schools, categorized by gender and admission decision. (Although these data are made up, similar situations occur in reality.) 13 Business Admit Deny Male 480 120 Female 180 20 Law Admit Deny Male 10 90 Female 100 200 (a) Make a two-way table of gender by admission decision for the two professional schools together by summing entries in these tables. (b) From the two-way table, calculate the percent of male applicants who are admitted and the percent of female applicants who are admitted. Wabash admits a higher percent of male applicants. (c) Now compute separately the percents of male and female applicants admitted by the business school and by the law school. Each school admits a higher percent of female applicants. (d) This is Simpson’s paradox: both schools admit a higher percent of the women who apply, but overall Wabash admits a lower percent of P1: FCH/SPH P2: FCH/SPH QC: FCH/SPH T1: FCH PB286B-06 PB286-Moore-V3.cls February 28, 2003 20:57 149Chapter 6 Media Exercises female applicants than of male applicants. Explain carefully, as if speaking to a skeptical reporter, how it can happen that Wabash appears to favor males when each school individually favors females. (Aneal Vohra/Index Stock Imagery/PictureQuest) 6.24 Obesity and health. Recent studies have shown that earlier reports underestimated the health risks associated with being overweight. The error was due to overlooking lurking variables. In particular, smoking tends both to reduce weight and to lead to earlier death. Illustrate Simpson’s paradox by a simpliﬁed version of this situation. That is, make up tables of overweight (yes or no) by early death (yes or no) by smoker (yes or no) such that \u0001 Overweight smokers and overweight nonsmokers both tend to die earlier than those not overweight. \u0001 But when smokers and nonsmokers are combined into a two-way table of overweight by early death, persons who are not overweight tend to die earlier. EESEE Chapter 6 MEDIA EXERCISES 6.25 Baldness and heart attacks. The EESEE story “Baldness and Heart Attacks” reports results from comparing men under the age of 55 who survived a ﬁrst heart attack with men admitted to the same hospitals for other reasons. As part of the study, each patient was asked to rate his own degree of baldness, from 1 (no baldness) to 5 (extreme baldness). Here are the counts: Baldness Heart attack Other score patients patients 1 251 331 2 165 221 3 195 185 4 50 34 5 21 Do these data show a relationship between degree of baldness and having a heart attack? What kind of relationship? (The EESEE story points out that there are lurking variables—in particular, the ages of the men.)
