# What is it?

In [[Software Engineering]], the *V model*  is a [[Process Models|process model]] created to solve some issues of the **its predecessor**, the [[Waterfall Model]].

It states **new phases** made to **validate the planning phases**. It also **differs its general step-by-step** from the [[Waterfall Model]], reducing its total *planning phases* to three.
