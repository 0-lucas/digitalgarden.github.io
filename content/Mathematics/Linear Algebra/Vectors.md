# What is it?

*Vectors* are **one of the most used objects** in [[Mathematics]], being applied in [[Tensors]], [[Linear Algebra]], [[Machine Learning]], and [[Deep Learning]].

*Vectors* refers to **quantities that cannot be expressed by a single value**, but it's **specific meaning can change** from where it's been applied. For example, in [[Euclidean Geometry]], a *vector* is a object with *magnitude* and *direction*, that goes from point $A$ to point $B$, represented by a line and denoted by $\overline{AB}$.

In [[Linear Algebra]], *vectors* can be thought as **single row or single column [[Matrices]]**. A *row vector* contains a **single row** and a *column vector* contains a **single column**. For example:
$$
\begin{align}
&\text{This a row vector:  }
\begin{bmatrix}-1 &  2.52& x^2\end{bmatrix} \\ \\
&\text{This is a column vector:  }
\begin{bmatrix} 0.75 \\ 50 \\ \sqrt{y} \end{bmatrix} 
\end{align}
$$
There are two common notations for *vectors*. A bold lowercase letter, or a lowercase letter with an arrow over it. For example:
$$
\begin{align}
&\text{Bold lowercase notation: }\textbf{x , y, z} \\
&\text{Overline lowercase notation: } \overline{x}, \overline{y}, \overline{z}
\end{align}
$$
