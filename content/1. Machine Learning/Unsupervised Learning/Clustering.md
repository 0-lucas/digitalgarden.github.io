# What is it?

In [[Machine Learning]], *clustering* is an [[Unsupervised Learning]] *task* which focuses on learning *patterns* and *structures* of a dataset, **grouping similar data points** into groups, often called *clusters*.

# Use cases

*Clustering* is a **flexible task** which can be used both as the **only model of a project**, or as a **processing step** for a later model.

- ##### Segmentation
	Given the need to **discover different segments or groups in a dataset**, one could apply *clustering* and then use the **output clusters** to perform any later analysis. *e.g. cluster customers and show different ads for each segment.*

- ##### Data analysis
	One could also apply *clustering* to the whole dataset, and then **analyze each cluster separately and differently**, depending on the objective.

- ##### [[Dimensionality Reduction]]
	Datasets with **too many features** can be **reduced** using *clustering* techniques. This process is called [[Dimensionality Reduction]].

- ##### Outlier / anomaly detection
	Any data point which **has no similarity** to the others or **doesn't properly fit into any cluster**, can be considered an [[Outlier]]. This method is commonly used to detect *fraudulent* instances.

 - ##### Semi-supervised learning
	When used with a badly labeled dataset, *clustering* can supplement another [[Machine Learning|ML]] algorithm **with labeled data** (which are the actual *clusters)*. This technique categorizes a [[Semi-Supervised Learning]] method.

# Types of clustering

There are four categories of *clustering* algorithms, which each one **differ in the method used to form** the *cluster*:

- ##### Centroid-based clustering
*Clusters* are represented by a **central reference vector** which **may not be part of the original dataset**. All data points revolve around the *cluster's centroid*. *e.g. [[K-Means]].*

- ##### Hierarchical clustering
Data points are **similar to closer data points**, and different than data points which are further away. The *cluster* is defined by the **maximum distance needed to connect data points**. *e.g. [[BIRCH Clustering]] and [[Agglomerative Clustering]].*

- ##### Distribution-based clustering
Built on [[Statistical Distribution|statistical distributions]] models, which data points are **clustered together if they belong to the same distribution**. Tend to be complex models which can easily [[Overfitting|overfit]]. *e.g. [[Gaussian Mixture Clustering]]* 

- ##### Density-based clustering
*Clusters* are created based on **areas which have high density**, and data points which are in **sparse areas are considered noise**, [[Outlier|outliers]], or border points.
