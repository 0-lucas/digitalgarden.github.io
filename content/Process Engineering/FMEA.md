# What is it?

*FMEA* is a methodology used to identify **potential failures modes before they occur**, allowing for the implementation of constrols that drive quality in product design and manufacturing.

>[!tip] How as FMEA created?
> *FMEA* was first created by *NASA* during the first Apollo projects, trying to answer the question: "what could go wrong when sending humans to the moon?"

*FMEA* however, by itself, **does not solve problems**. It's supposed to be made before any failures occur, in a **preventive way**. It just be applied as a **risk assessment tool**, instead of analyzing failures after it happened.

It's normally applied for:

- ##### New projects, technologies or processes.
- ##### Changes in existing products or processes.
- ##### Existing projects, products or processes in a new environment.

# Types of FMEA

There are four main types of FMEA, each applied to the type of analysis needed.
- Process FMEA
- Design FMEA
- System FMEA
- Machine FMEA

# FMEA effectiveness evidences

*FMEA* should not be a independent document, and should always be updated frequently, as a *live document*. It should be fully correlated with the *control plan* and **others *FMEAs***. 

*RPNs* should be checked and controlled, with corrective/ preventice actions in planning or being implemented.
