# What is it?

In [[Machine Learning]], *unsupervised learning* refers to **all algorithms which learn patterns** with data exclusively **without labels**, using only the *input features*. 
This takes a more *data-driven* approach to the problem, given that all **possible outputs come directly** from the *features* itself. The focus is on *patterns* or ***structure* recognition from data**, *e.g., grouping similar data points*.

>[!tip] What differs from [[Supervised Learning]]
In [[Supervised Learning]], training data contains **both** *features* and *target* variables. In *unsupervised learning*, the training data **contains only** the *features*, **without** any *target* variables to predict.

# Algorithms of unsupervised ML

All use cases of *unsupervised learning* [[Algorithms|algorithms]] could be **boiled down** to [[Clustering]], which identify *patterns* and *structures* in data, and [[Autoencoding]], which **identify latent factors in data**.

Some uses are [[Clustering]] with [[Algorithms|algorithms]] like [[K-Means]], and [[Autoencoding]] and [[Dimensionality Reduction]], with [[Algorithms|algorithms]] like [[PCA]].
