## Scrum roles

There are three roles present in a *Scrum* project:

- #### Product Owner
	**Represents the end user**, responsible for the project itself. Will raise the **most important requirements** to be treated in a *sprint* and be the **middle-man** between the *Scrum team* and real end users.

- #### Scrum team
	The **development team**, which can include software developers, designers, and analysts. Normally, formed of **six to ten people**.

## Product Backlog and Sprints

Each **functionality to be implemented in a project** is maintained in a list called *Product Backlog*. Each item of is called *PBI*, which stands for *Product Backlog Item*.
The *Product Backlog Item* is divided in *tasks*, which are the **smallest unit of work**, representing an **actionable step**.

The **development iteration** is called *Sprint*, which lasts a few weeks. At each *Sprint*, the team will get some *Product Backlog Items* and transfer them to the *Sprint Backlog*, which will need to be implemented until the end of the *Sprint*.

## Meetings

- #### Daily Stand Up Meeting
	The *daily Stand Up Meeting* is a **daily meeting which update team members about the status of each task**, lasting fifteen minutes. Each member must update **what he did**, **what will do**, and if **is there any blockers**.

- #### Sprint Retro and Planning
	At the end of each *Sprint*, a *Sprint Retro* meeting **will assess the work done**, what can be done to **improve the process**, and if the **product is good enough** to be delivered.
	At the beginning of each *Sprint*, a *Sprint Planning* meeting will prepare each member to **what will he do** and **plan the overall** *Sprint* ahead.
