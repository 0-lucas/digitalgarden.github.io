# Subjective Measurement

The main characteristic of *history points*, is that its **totally subjective**. 
The main input for the feature comes from the end-user, which then will be **subjectively translated to technical requirement**, and then for a method of identifying **how much time will it take to complete** a user story.

One could take the amount of days needed for a **number of developers to finish a user story** and **multiply by the number of developers**, e.g. two developers would take six days to finish a task, so it's $6\times 2 = 12$.
