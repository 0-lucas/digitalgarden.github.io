# What is it?

*Computational graphs* are an **abstraction** of a *graph* used to represent [[Mathematics|mathematical]] expressions, used in [[Deep Learning]] to represent a model, or a [[Neural Networks|neural network.]]

It's a *directed graph* where each **node corresponds** to an *operation* or a *variable*. For example, a *computational graph* for **a simple Linear Regression**:

This is, in the end, the **same as the equation** $y = wx + b$.
