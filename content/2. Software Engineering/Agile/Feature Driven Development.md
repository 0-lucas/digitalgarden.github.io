# What is it?

In [[Software Engineering]], the *FDD method*, which stands for **feature driven development**, is an [[Agile]] method that emphasizes the use of [[Object-Oriented Programming]], and it's a **feature-focused method**, as opposed to *delivery-focused* method like [[Scrum]].

Also differently from [[Scrum]], where the *product owner* is typically seen as the user, in *FDD*, the end user is the **actual user**. *FDD* also **relies on documentation** to **communicate important information** of the project, instead of continuous communication within the team, like in [[Scrum]].

# How does it work?

Typically, a project life cycle is divided in *initial modelling* and *model storming*, with each having more actions inside. For **each project**, the *initial modelling* is done only once, while the **last steps are done for every feature**.

- ### Develop an overall model
	An overall model shape is formed for the project, **with the goals and target audience in mind,** and their **needs**. This can be divided into *domain models*, which are **sub parts of the overall system**.

- ### Build a features list
	A **list of features is created**, with the requirements gathered from the first step, and **all client-valued inputs**. Each feature needs to be **completed in two weeks' time**, keeping in mind that it should be **purposes and functionalities**, instead of tasks.

- ### Plan by feature
	Analyse the **complexity of each feature** and plan **tasks to accomplish** said feature. **All members should take part in the planning** phase, so that **every facet of the development process** is approached.
	Enter [[Object-Oriented Programming]]. Each **developer will take care** of a [[Class]] for a **developing feature**, and collaboration between different classes means collaboration between developers. **Feature teams** may also exist, where **class owners get together to develop a feature**.

- ### Build by feature
	Here, each class and *program unit* is built, and a **feature prototype is created**, applying [[Unit Testing]], and then promoted to the main build.

>[!tip] Longer features are broken
>For any feature that its **time estimation exceeds more than two weeks**, it should apply the *two-week rule*. The *two-week rule* states that these long features should be **broken into smaller ones** until it fits the time period.
