# What is it?

In [[Software Engineering]], *Agile methods* were created to fix some issues from **traditional prescriptive [[Process Models|process models]]**, which **didn't developed software fast** or competent enough, while also **putting a heavy burden on developers**. More time was spent on planning, than on developing and testing.

The *Manifesto for Agile Software Development* states **four core principles** which any *agile* team should follow:

- ##### **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

- ##### **Working software** over comprehensive documentation

- ##### **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

- ##### **Responding to change** over following a plan
