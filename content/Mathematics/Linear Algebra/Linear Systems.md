# What is it?

In [[Mathematics]], and specially in [[Linear Algebra]], a *linear system* is a **group of two or more equations involving the same variable**, which is **linearly related**.

Take the following *linear system* for example:
$$
\begin{cases}
3a + b = 13\\
-2a + 7b = 22
\end{cases} 
$$
One could solve it for $a, b$ using the [[Gaussian Elimination Method]], for instance.
