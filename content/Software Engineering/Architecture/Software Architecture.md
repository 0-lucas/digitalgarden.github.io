In [[Software Engineering]], a software project is a preliminary effort to create all **functionality which attends requirements**, the **back-end** and **front-end** of the software, and **how all of this is connected**. 
This structure is the *architecture* of the software.

# What is it?

The *architecture* represents the [[Data Structures|data structure]] and all **components necessary to build an operational project**. It's **not the software itself**, but an **abstraction used to structure the way that the software works**. It's in itself, the **structure and blueprint of the software**.
