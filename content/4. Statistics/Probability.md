# Notation and Definition

On most text books, the *probability* of an event $A$ is referred as $P(A)$. This value takes a range of $0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$ for **any possible condition**. For a simple context, one can **calculate the *probability* of an event** with:

$$
P(event) = \frac{\text{Number of favourable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}
$$

The **total number of outcomes** is closed related to the *sample space*, which is the set of **all possible results to occur for any event**.
