# What is it?

*Data linearization* is the process of taking **non-linear data and transforming it to linear**. This is most commonly used in [[Statistics]], to fit **non-linear data to linear models**.

## Linearizing $y = a * x^\alpha$ 

For  $y = a * x^\alpha$ models, we can apply [[Logarithms]] to *linearize* the data.

$$
\begin{align}
&\ln y =\ln a *x^a \\
&\ln y = \ln a + a* \ln x
\end{align}
$$
