# What is it?

*Standard deviation* is a [[Statistics|statistical measurement]] mainly used in [[Descriptive Statistics]] and [[Probability]], being commonly referenced as $\sigma$. 
It's a measure of how **dispersed the data is** in relation **to the mean**. Lower *standard deviations* represent more clustered data, and higher means it's spread out.

# Calculating the standard deviation

Given $x$ as **the variable**, $\overline{x}$ as the **mean value of the variable**, and $n$ as the **total number of data points**, one can apply the following formula to get the *standard deviation* of a variable:
$$
\begin{align}
&\text{For populations:} \\
&\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x_i - \overline{x})^2}{n}}
\\ \\
&\text{For samples:} \\
&s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x_i - \overline{x})^2}{n -1}}
\end{align}
$$
>[!tip] *Standard deviation* vs Variance
>  One may notice that the formula for *standard deviation* is **quite similar to [[Variance]]**. In fact, *standard deviation* can be interpreted as the **square root of the [[Variance]] of the variable**.
