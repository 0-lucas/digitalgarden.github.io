# What is it?

In [[Software Engineering]], *evolutionary prototyping* is **flexible** [[Process Models|process model]] in which the system's **[[Requirements|requirements]] are still being defined and refined** as the system itself is being developed as a **prototype**.

# How does it work?
Using *evolutionary prototyping*, the development team can **develop the system while [[Requirements|requirements]] are still being defined** with the user, once the **user's feedback is implemented** into each version of the prototype.

>[!tip] How to prototype?
> Because **user's feedback is essential** in this [[Process Models|process model]], the developer must **create the prototype as fast as possible**, and then begin to iterate with the user to define the system [[Requirements|requirements]].
> 
> Most likely, the front-end is the part to be shown to the user first, and then after all visualization is done, then the back-end logic begins to be developed.

However, the main drawback of the *evolutionary prototyping* is that it **depends solely on the user's feedback**. Because of that, **poor feedback can make the system unusable** because of needed features that were not given by the user, or features that don't make sense for development.
